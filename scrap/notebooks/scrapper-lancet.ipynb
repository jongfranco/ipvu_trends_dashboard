      "BackgroundA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.MethodsAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.FindingsBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.InterpretationThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 μL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 μL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final reaction mix concentration of the primers was 500 nM and probe was 200 nM. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: 50°C for 15 min and 95°C for 3 min, 50 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 45 s. Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead.

We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission.19Perlman S Netland J Coronaviruses post-SARS: update on replication and pathogenesis.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009; 7: 439-450CrossrefPubMedScopus (306)Google Scholar Airborne precautions, such as a fit-tested N95 respirator, and other personal protective equipment are strongly recommended. To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored among health-care workers. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymptomatic infections.\n",

      "Similarities of clinical features between 2019-nCoV and previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans. These features of 2019-nCoV infection bear some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.20Lee N Hui D Wu A et al.A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.N Engl J Med. 2003; 348: 1986-1994CrossrefPubMedScopus (1249)Google Scholar,  21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (409)Google Scholar However, few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway. Furthermore, 2019-nCoV patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhoea), whereas about 20–25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhoea.21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (409)Google Scholar Faecal and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage.\n",

      "The pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum (eg, IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1) were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103CrossrefPubMedScopus (220)Google Scholar MERS-CoV infection was also reported to induce increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL15, and IL17).23Mahallawi WH Khabour OF Zhang Q Makhdoum HM Suliman BA MERS-CoV infection in humans is associated with a pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokine profile.Cytokine. 2018; 104: 8-13CrossrefPubMedScopus (13)Google Scholar We noted that patients infected with 2019-nCoV also had high amounts of IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity. However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103CrossrefPubMedScopus (220)Google Scholar Further studies are necessary to characterise the Th1 and Th2 responses in 2019-nCoV infection and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Autopsy or biopsy studies would be the key to understand the disease.\n",

However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance.27Stockman LJ Bellamy R Garner P SARS: systematic review of treatment effects.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e343CrossrefPubMedScopus (193)Google Scholar,  28Lansbury L Rodrigo C Leonardi-Bee J Nguyen-Van-Tam J Lim WS Corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019; 2: CD010406PubMedGoogle Scholar,  29Arabi YM Mandourah Y Al-Hameed F et al.Corticosteroid therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome.Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2018; 197: 757-767CrossrefPubMedScopus (51)Google Scholar Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance.30WHOClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.https://www.who.int/internal-publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspectedDate: Jan 11, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Among our cohort of 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection, corticosteroids were given to very few non-ICU cases, and low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids were given to less than half of severely ill patients with ARDS. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n",

      "No antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. In a historical control study,31Chu CM Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256CrossrefPubMedScopus (222)Google Scholar the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes). Arabi and colleagues initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection in Saudi Arabia.32Arabi YM Alothman A Balkhy HH et al.Treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome with a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-β1b (MIRACLE trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.Trials. 2018; 19: 81CrossrefPubMedScopus (30)Google Scholar Preclinical evidence showed the potent efficacy of remdesivir (a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug) to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections.33Sheahan TP Sims AC Graham RL et al.Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses.Sci Transl Med. 2017; 9eaal3653CrossrefPubMedScopus (75)Google Scholar,  34Sheahan TP Sims AC Leist SR et al.Comparative therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir and combination lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 222CrossrefPubMedScopus (62)Google Scholar As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus. Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection.\n",

      "Our study has some limitations. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariable-adjusted methods. This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity. At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies.\n",

      "Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively.35Cui J Li F Shi Z-L Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2019; 17: 181-192CrossrefPubMedScopus (113)Google Scholar Extensive research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has driven the discovery of many SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses in bats.

Reliable quick pathogen tests and feasible differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians in their first contact with suspected patients. Because of the pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaption, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.\n",

      "Italy was the first European country to encounter the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.1Li C Romagnani P von Brunn A Hans-Joachim A SARS-CoV-2 and Europe: timing of containment measures for outbreak control.Infection. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1007/s15010-020-01420-9Google Scholar For people with multiple sclerosis, the situation carries additional reasons for concern. Although emerging work suggests that some coexisting diseases, such as hypertension, might increase the severity of the COVID-19 infection, how less common conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, effect COVID-19 outcomes is still uncertain. Furthermore, immunosuppressive therapies, the mainstay of treatment for multiple sclerosis, might confer additional risks or, on the contrary, confer some protection. Therefore, collecting information to evaluate the relationship between multiple sclerosis and COVID-19 and implement immediate and appropriate protective strategies is crucial. Less crucial, but equally as important, are questions about the long-term effect of this pandemic on psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety (common comorbidities in multiple sclerosis), the patient–physician relationship, the spread of scientific information, the development of new models of care, and the role of patients and patient organisations in the community.The Italian Multiple Sclerosis Society (AISM), the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation (FISM), and the Multiple Sclerosis Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society have set up a programme to help with these crucial elements in the response to COVID-19 in patients with multiple sclerosis. The programme was developed according to suggestions received from a group of neurologists, including health-care workers on the front-line and representatives of the AISM and the FISM. Further initiatives of the programme will also consider the results of an online survey made by the AISM and the FISM aimed at understanding the most pressing needs of people with multiple sclerosis during this pandemic.Here we report the results of the pilot phase of an investigation of COVID-19 among people with multiple sclerosis, based on a core set of data collected from treatment providers through a specifically designed web-based case report form. The core data set includes clinical and demographic characteristics, and information on disease-modifying therapies. To be included, patients had to have symptoms and signs of COVID-19 infection, with or without a positive test (RT-PCR on nasal and pharyngeal swabs).On March 14, 2020, we sent the case report form to more than 200 Italian neurologists from about 90 multiple sclerosis centres across Italy. As of April 7, 2020, we have collected data on 232 patients from 38 centres, 57 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 and 175 of whom had suspected COVID-19 symptoms but did not have a positive test (appendix p 1). Mean follow-up was 12·6 days (SD 7·4).The severity of COVID-19 infection in 232 patients was classified as mild (no pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in 223 (96%), severe (shortness of breath, respiratory rates ≥30 breaths per min, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2:FiO2 <300 mmHg/%, and an increase in lung infiltrates of >50% within 24–48 h) in four (2%), and critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction or failure) in six (3%).2Chinese Center for Disease Control and PreventionThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China.Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020; 41: 145-151Google Scholar Of the six critical patients, one recovered and five died; all had a positive swab (appendix p 2). 21 patients had undergone a 5-day course of methylprednisolone within 3 months before the onset of COVID-19.These results appear to be slightly reassuring and do not seem to contradict guidelines that we and others had already issued on the management of multiple sclerosis treatments in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.3Multiple Sclerosis International FederationGlobal COVID-19 advice for people with MS.http://www.msif.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MSIF-Global-advice-on-COVID-19-for-people-with-MS.docx-1.pdfDate: March, 2020Date accessed: April 23, 2020Google Scholar These data must be considered only preliminary, however, and there is not enough information to speculate about any susceptibility to protection from COVID-19 afforded by disease-modifying therapies. The same is true for the effect of comorbidities, sex, and other medications (beyond just the disease-modifying therapies) that patients with multiple sclerosis might be taking.We will continue to monitor these patients throughout the duration of the pandemic. When a system to record all patients with multiple sclerosis positive for COVID-19 is implemented, more data on the prevalence of these cases can be gathered.Our web-based platform for data collection is available to all colleagues interested in collecting this type of data. Through procedures that are currently being defined, we also aim to make the raw consolidated data from this web-based case report form open access.MPS reports personal fees from Biogen, Merck, Teva, Novartis, Sanofi Genzyme, Roche, GeNeuro, and Medday, outside the submitted work.

      "In the absence of vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, intensive contact tracing, and case isolation remain frontline measures in controlling the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.1Wilder-Smith A Freedman DO Isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment: pivotal role for old-style public health measures in the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak.J Travel Med. 2020; 27taaa020Google Scholar In Wuhan, China, these measures were implemented alongside city lockdown, mass quarantine, and school closure during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in January and February, 2020.2Niu Y Xu F Deciphering the power of isolation in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks.Lancet Glob Health. 2020; 8: e452-ee53Google Scholar Critical to Wuhan's success, cases identified through liberal testing, regardless of symptom profile, were immediately isolated in purpose-built shelters, as delays in isolation from symptom onset increase transmission risk substantially.3Hellewell J Abbott S Gimma A et al.Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts.Lancet Glob Health. 2020; 8: e488-e496Google ScholarEuropean countries and the USA have mostly followed these measures, except, in most cases, only people with severe symptoms are being admitted to hospital, whereas people with mild symptoms are asked to self-isolate at home. Test kit shortages and limited health-care facility capacity have also led to unconfirmed cases self-isolating at home.Compliance with home isolation, however, is partial. In Israel, 57% of people with unconfirmed infection did not self-isolate because they were not financially compensated4Bodas M Peleg K Self-isolation compliance in the COVID-19 era influenced by compensation: findings from a recent survey in Israel. A cross sectional study of the adult population of Israel to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak and self-isolation.Health Aff (Millwood). 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00382Google Scholar and because the lay public is not informed on how to keep strict isolation measures at home.We modelled and compared two types of isolation measures: institution-based isolation and home-based isolation. The former is modelled after China, with isolation of confirmed cases in quarantine facilities5Chen S Zhang Z Yang J et al.Fangcang shelter hospitals: a novel concept for responding to public health emergencies.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1305-1314Google Scholar resulting in no further onward within-household transmission, and the quarantining of contacts with legal enforcement. Once quarantined, contact rates are reduced by 75% in the household and by 90% in the community.We contrasted this with home-based isolation, modelled after Europe and the USA, where home isolation of confirmed cases is the current policy. This approach is assumed to cause a 50% reduction in contact within the home and a 75% reduction in contact in the community. Contact cases have an overall reduced interaction at an assumed contact rate of 50%. No reduction in transmission is assumed to occur for asymptomatic infections because asymptomatic cases are not being identified and isolated.We used GeoDEMOS-R,6Koo JR Cook AR Park M et al.Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online March 23.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30162-6Google Scholar an agent-based respiratory illness simulation model that estimates the total number of infections through time and measures the effects of quarantining, physcial distancing, and school closure on a city population. A different calibration procedure,7Chowell G Nishiura H Bettencourt LMA Comparative estimation of the reproduction number for pandemic influenza from daily case notification data.J R Soc Interface. 2007; 4: 155-166Google Scholar however, was used to estimate the number of infections over time. We assumed a basic reproduction number of 2 for the initial 4-week phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, with a subsequent decrease in the effective reproduction number due to the implementation of physical distancing control measures. The model represents a large city of 4 million residents, modelled upon the city-state of Singapore.Relative to the baseline with no control measures (figure), our models showed that home-based isolation causes an 8-day delay (IQR 5–11) in the epidemic peak, with a corresponding reduction of 7100 cases (IQR 6800–7400) at this peak and 190 000 cases averted throughout the epidemic (IQR 185 000–194 000). Institution-based isolation created a peak delay of 18 days and a reduction of 18 900 cases (18 700–19 100). A total of 546 000 cases (IQR 540 000–550 000) are averted throughout the epidemic, representing roughly a 57% reduction in comparison to 20% reduction through home-based isolation.FigureNumber of new infections (A) and cumulative infections (B) within 7 months under the baseline control measures (black), home-based isolation (blue), and institution-based isolation (red)View Large\n",

They also provide theoretical support for the approach successfully implemented in Wuhan, where fangcang isolation shelters were established for all infected and potentially exposed individuals.5Chen S Zhang Z Yang J et al.Fangcang shelter hospitals: a novel concept for responding to public health emergencies.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1305-1314Google Scholar These shelters provided triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring, rapid referrals, and essential living and social engagements for the wellbeing of those isolated. Crucially, the fangcang obviated most of the risk of within-household transmission, which frequently occurs as viral loads can be high for mild infections.8Wang Z Ma W Zheng X Wu G Zhang R Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.J Infect. 2020;  (published online April 10.)DOI:10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.040Google Scholar Home-based isolation, which is reliant on personal compliance, will therefore inevitably lead to increased transmission. Although cities within Europe and the USA might not be able to create make-shift isolation centres similar to those in Wuhan, due to a lack of social acceptability or negative public perceptions, other strategies should be considered to reduce transmission, such as repurposing hotels or dormitories.

Randomised evidence was needed following high-profile publications on the first US COVID-19 case3Holshue ML DeBolt C Lindquist S et al.First case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 929-936Google Scholar and the subsequent compassionate use of remdesivir in a 53-patient case series,4Grein J Ohmagari N Shin D et al.Compassionate use of remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online April 10.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007016Google Scholar which, coupled with in-vitro and animal model evidence, had generated high expectations of remdesivir efficacy.Promising signals from observational data must be rigorously confirmed or refuted in high-quality randomised trials—particularly given that for COVID-19 no proven safe and effective treatments yet exist. Ideally, efficacy-based trials, including proof-of-mechanism studies, should precede larger pragmatic effectiveness trials.5Ford I Norrie J Pragmatic Trials.N Engl J Med. 2016; 375: 454-463Google Scholar That is additionally challenging in a pandemic, and the temptation to lower the threshold of convincing evidence must be resisted, because adopting ineffective and potentially unsafe interventions risks only harm without worthwhile benefit, while making it even harder to undertake trials to find truly effective and safe interventions. We have already seen other drugs, repurposed for COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine6Tang W et al.Hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, controlled trial.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 14.)

The study closed on March 29, having begun on Feb 6.Here, stopping early gives an underpowered trial, which taken alone, gives inconclusive findings. The study has not shown a statistically significant finding that confirms a remdesivir treatment benefit of at least the minimally clinically important difference, nor has it ruled such a benefit out. The study sought a treatment effect of hazard ratio (HR) 1·40, translating to reducing median time to clinical improvement to 15 days (remdesivir) versus 21 days (placebo). The observed HR of 1·23 suggests that a benefit, if it exists, might be smaller than anticipated. This study is the first randomised trial of intravenous remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19, so it is difficult to know what the minimally clinically important difference is.8Cook JA Julious SA Sones W et al.DELTA2 guidance on choosing the target difference and undertaking and reporting the sample size calculation for a randomised controlled trial.BMJ. 2018; 363k3750Google Scholar That will depend on a complex reckoning of evidence for effectiveness, safety, acceptability, access, and cost. It is possible that even if the 453-patient target was reached, the study would have still been underpowered if a minimally clinically important difference of less than an HR of 1·4 was warranted.However, likewise, a larger benefit might exist, or remdesivir might actually do harm. It is unknown—more data are needed. Fortunately, ClinicalTrials.gov indicates that five randomised trials involving remdesivir are recruiting globally, with one in severe COVID-19 from Gilead (NCT04292899), the drug manufacturer, with a target of 6000 participants; naively, this trial should be adequately powered.In the meantime, how can the findings of Wang and colleagues be interpreted? The statistical reporting is clear, stating that the main findings were not statistically significant and acknowledging that the trial was underpowered (their post-hoc calculation indicated a power of 58% given the 236 participants with available data). However, a trial is not just its primary clinical outcome—there are important data on safety, viral load, and secondary outcomes. 22 (14%) of 158 patients on remdesivir died versus ten (13%) of 78 on placebo, and there was no signal that viral load decreased differentially over time between remdesivir and placebo groups. Furthermore, there were no differential signals on safety. Analyses were very similar under both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol principles.View Large\n",

Only patients who were 12 days or less from illness onset were eligible overall, so a prespecified subgroup analysis investigated those who started study treatment up to 10 days versus more than 10 days (up to 12 days) from illness onset. Of course, even with an adequately powered study, subgroup analyses are generally not powered (and here, the 2:1 allocation further reduced power). There was no significant interaction of 10 days or less versus more than 10 days—ie, little support statistically of treatment effect moderation by time of initiation. Nor was either the 10 days or less or the more than 10 days within-subgroup treatment effects significant. Nonetheless, the authors give prominence to the 10 days or less subgroup, reporting a non-statistically significant HR of 1·52 (95% CI 0·95 to 2·43), median 18 days (IQR 12 to 28) versus 23 days (15 to 28), and a non-significant reduction in mortality (difference −3·6% [95% CI −16·2 to 8·9]). There was a possible baseline imbalance with 71 (45%) remdesivir patients versus 47 (60%) placebo patients in the 10 days or less subgroup, and possibly more patients with hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease allocated to remdesivir than placebo, making interpretation even more difficult. Subgroup analyses, particularly for phase 3 confirmatory effectiveness trials, have justifiably been criticised9Assmann SF Pocock SJ Enos LE Kasten LE Subgroup analysis and other (mis)uses of baseline data in clinical trials.Lancet. 2000; 355: 1064-1069Google Scholar and even ridiculed.10Sleight P Debate: subgroup analyses in clinical trials: fun to look at—but don't believe them!.Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med. 2000; 1: 25-27Google Scholar Giving a subgroup analysis prominence over the primary analysis is unfortunately common. In early phase studies in a pandemic, little is known for certain, and it seems biologically plausible that treating patients earlier could be more effective. Nonetheless, as well as being vigilant against overinterpretation, we need to ensure that hypotheses generated in efficacy-based trials, even in subgroups, are confirmed or refuted in subsequent adequately powered trials or meta-analyses.We have already seen how different interpretations will be put on these results, with the unintended early release of this study's results on the WHO website.11BBCHopes dashed as coronavirus drug remdesivir ‘fails first trial’.www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52406261Date: April 23, 2020Date accessed: April 25, 2020Google Scholar This underlines how labelling of trials is mistaken as positive or negative—equating a p>0·05 with no evidence of benefit.

      "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are now being found in jails throughout the USA. Conditions in jails are very conducive to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and social distancing is impossible. Therefore, there is widespread concern that there could be major outbreaks in jails and that jails could amplify transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in surrounding communities.Jails can house a large number of inmates; the Los Angeles County jail (the largest in the USA) houses around 20 000 inmates.1Kajita E Okano JT Bodine EN Layne SP Blower S Modelling an outbreak of an emerging pathogen.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2007; 5: 700-709Google Scholar However, inmates spend, on average, 2 months incarcerated.2Los Angeles AlmanacLos Angeles County Jail system by the numbers.http://www.laalmanac.com/crime/cr25b.phpDate accessed: April 17, 2020Google Scholar This is because inmates in jail are either awaiting trial or sentencing or have been convicted of minor offences. As a preventive measure against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, some jails are releasing low-risk offenders early or admitting fewer inmates, or both.3Williams T Weiser B Rashbaum WK ‘Jails are petri dishes’: inmates freed as the virus spreads behind bars.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/coronavirus-prisons-jails.htmlDate: March 30, 2020Date accessed: April 17, 2020Google Scholar It is unclear whether these interventions will be sufficient to prevent the occurrence of major outbreaks.The within-jail basic reproduction number for SARS-CoV-2, R0wj, can be used to determine the proportion of inmates that need to be released early, and how early they need to be released, to prevent an outbreak occurring. R0wj is defined as the average number of secondary infections of COVID-19 that are caused by one infectious inmate during the time that they are incarcerated. If R0wj is greater than 1, then an outbreak will occur in the jail; if R0wj is less than 1, an outbreak will not occur. the greater the value of R0wj, the more severe the outbreak. To prevent an outbreak from occurring, interventions need to reduce R0wj to less than 1.The interventions that are necessary to reduce R0wj to 1 are shown in the figure. Inmates who are not released early are assumed to spend an average of 60 days incarcerated. Both curves show that there are multiple interventions, in terms of the proportion of inmates that are released early and how early they should be released, that would be effective in preventing an outbreak. For example, if R0wj equals 1·1 in the absence of interventions (red line), any of the following three interventions would be effective: (1) not admitting 9% of potential inmates to the jail; (2) releasing 20% of inmates after an average of 11 days in jail; or (3) releasing all inmates after an average of 39 days in jail. If R0wj equals 1·5 in the absence of interventions (blue line), more extreme interventions would be necessary to prevent an outbreak occurring—for example, (1) not admitting 33% of potential inmates to the jail; (2) releasing 60% of inmates after an average of 8 days in jail; or (3) releasing all inmates after an average of 16 days in jail.FigureThe proportion of inmates that should be released early to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in a jailShow full captionThe mathematical expression for the R0wj of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and the parameter values used to generate the graph, are provided in the appendix.

      "Global movement behaviour guidelines recommend that preschool children (aged 3–4 years) accumulate at least 180 min physical activity, engage in no more than 1 h sedentary screen time, and have 10–13 h good-quality sleep per day. For school-age children and adolescents (5–17 years), the recommendations are to participate in at least 60 min moderate-intensity to vigorous-intensity physical activity, engage in no more than 2 h sedentary recreational screen time, and have 9–11 h good-quality sleep each day.Children typically obtain their daily physical activity through active travel to school; physical education and recess; organised sports, games, and dance; active play; and spending time in playgrounds and parks. Conversely, most of their sedentary time and sleep are accumulated at home. As a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, opportunities for children to meet the movement behaviour guidelines have been affected by school closures and physical distancing measures implemented by many governments.To date, we have little evidence to know if, as a result of home confinement, children are spending less time active, going to bed later, and sleeping in later because they do not have to travel to school, or spending more time sedentary, especially through recreational screen time. Evidence shows that children are less active and more sedentary, with less consistent sleep patterns, on unstructured or non-school days (ie, when they are not physically at school) than on school days.1Lin Y Tremblay MS Katzmarzyk PT et al.Temporal and bi-directional associations between sleep duration and physical activity/sedentary time in children: an international comparison.Prev Med. 2018; 111: 436-441Google Scholar Community mobility data from Google across the 15 countries represented by our authorship show that—compared with the week ending Feb 23, 2020, before the WHO pandemic announcement—time spent in places associated with physical activity such as parks, beaches, and community gardens was down by 31%, and travel by public transport, which is also associated with physical activity, was down by 59% during the week ending April 5, 2020, after a pandemic was declared. Conversely, time spent in places of residence increased by an average of 17%. Compared with before the COVID-19 crisis, Canadians aged 15–49 years reported a 66% increase in time watching TV and 35% increase in time spent playing video games between March 29 and April 3, 2020. Interviews done with 15 parents of preschool children in Beijing, China, found that, compared with pre-COVID-19, nearly all children were going to bed later and waking up later. Sedentary screen time had increased and physical activity levels were very low, with children not being allowed outdoors (unpublished data). In South Korea, we surveyed 97 parents of young children between March 27 and 31, 2020; 79 (81%) reported that their children's screen time had increased and 46 (94%) of 49 reported that their children's use of play and sports facilities had decreased.If this pandemic has reduced healthy movement behaviours among children, we should be concerned for several reasons. First, data from the pre-COVID-19 period show that, on average, only a fifth of preschoolers and less than 10% of school-aged children meet all the movement guidelines.2Roman-Viñas B Chaput J-P Katzmarzyk PT et al.Proportion of children meeting recommendations for 24-hour movement guidelines and associations with adiposity in a 12-country study.Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2016; 13: 123Google Scholar Given the strong associations of health outcomes with movement behaviours,3Kuzik N Poitras VJ Tremblay MS Lee E-Y Hunter S Carson V Systematic review of the relationships between combinations of movement behaviours and health indicators in the early years (0–4 years).BMC Public Health. 2017; 17: 849Google Scholar,  4Saunders TJ Gray CE Poitras VJ Combinations of physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep: relationships with health indicators in school-aged children and youth.Appl Physiol Nutr Metab. 2016; 41: S283-S293Google Scholar children's health will be even more compromised during COVID-19. Second, this period of home confinement—especially if indoors and in small spaces—could lead to higher risk of vitamin D deficiency5Milagres L Rocha N Albuquerque F et al.Sedentary behavior is associated with lower serum concentrations of vitamin D in Brazilian children.Public Health. 2017; 152: 75-78Google Scholar, mental health issues,6Brooks SK Webster RK Smith LE et al.The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence.Lancet. 2020; 395: 912-920Google Scholar and myopia.7Lanca C Saw SM The association between digital screen time and myopia: A systematic review.Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2020; 40: 216-229Google Scholar Third, although children seem less susceptible to COVID-19, maintaining or increasing levels of physical activity can reduce their risk of respiratory infections.8Timmons BW Exercise and immune function in children.Am J Lifestyle Med. 2007; 1: 59-66Google Scholar Fourth, benefits that help children to cope with life-changing circumstances, such as the role of physical activity in resilience building, might be compromised. Fifth, the interactive effects of each movement behaviour might be more pronounced—eg, children who are less active and engaged in more screen time are likely to have poorer sleep. Finally, there could be potential longer-term health and economic consequences if the adverse behavioural adaptations, such as less activity, become the new normal.9Rajmil L Medina-Bustos A de Sanmamed M-JF Mompart-Penina A Impact of the economic crisis on children's health in Catalonia: a before–after approach.BMJ Open. 2013; 3e003286Google ScholarIt is important to examine whether children from low-income and middle-income countries and vulnerable families in high-income countries are especially at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a greater proportion of these populations live in apartments or shelters that are exposed to overcrowding (appendix), making physical distancing virtually impossible. These groups tend to accumulate physical activity through outdoor play and active commuting to school, which is threatened by an increase in time indoors.10Tremblay MS Gray CE Akinroye K et al.Physical activity of children: a global matrix of grades comparing 15 countries.J Phys Act Health. 2014; 11: S113-S125Google Scholar Poorer neighbourhood safety—especially in countries where schools might be the only safe play space in the neighbourhood—make it harder for children to be active when schools are closed. At home, there might be reduced access to the internet or inability to pay for increased data usage to access online content such as videos and virtual activity classes.Many resources aimed at promoting healthy movement behaviours in children have rapidly emerged. As such, there is a real need to support stakeholders with a trusted source of activities and curated online resources. Such activities and resources should consider equity, minimal equipment, protection of children online, opportunities for parent–child interactions, and consideration of small spaces. This is especially crucial in communities with little access to the internet.Based on the evidence presented, we outline our recommendations for promoting healthy movement behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic (panel). We acknowledge that many parents are juggling reduced income, food insecurity, and working from home while supervising their children's daily schooling, so movement behaviours might not be a priority. However, we believe that the pandemic provides an opportunity to raise awareness of movement behaviour guidelines for chIldren and to promote their uptake across all areas of society.PanelRecommendations for promoting healthy movement behaviour•Parents and carers should incorporate physical activity into children's daily routine (including using electronic media to facilitate participation) and encourage the whole family to join while adhering to regulations on physical distancing and access to outdoor spaces. Extended periods of sitting should be broken up every 30–60 min (eg, by standing and stretching for 1 min). They should follow sedentary recreational screen-time recommendations and encourage co-viewing and positive social interactions and experiences. To help children to get enough sleep, keep bed and wake times consistent, keep screens out of the room where children sleep, and avoid screen use before bedtime.•Educators and teachers should know and promote the movement behaviour guidelines, and embrace opportunities to incorporate healthy movement messages, practices, and policies into daily home-school routines and lessons—eg, when scheduling online lessons, limit prolonged sitting and encourage changes in posture such as regularly standing, stretching, or moving on the spot.•Health professionals should understand and recommend the current guidelines to parents, family members, and caregivers and reinforce their positive association with children's health during all visits, including remote contacts and telemedicine.•Governments should promote healthy movement behaviours in children as part of response strategies and public messaging, and should engage influential people in promotion of such messages.•The media should provide regular messages to promote physical activity and break up extended periods of sitting.•Children should speak up and advocate for their right to a healthy, active life, while carefully observing pandemic restrictions. Forming peer groups can help with maintaining healthy movement behaviour patterns.•Parents and carers should incorporate physical activity into children's daily routine (including using electronic media to facilitate participation) and encourage the whole family to join while adhering to regulations on physical distancing and access to outdoor spaces. Extended periods of sitting should be broken up every 30–60 min (eg, by standing and stretching for 1 min).

To help children to get enough sleep, keep bed and wake times consistent, keep screens out of the room where children sleep, and avoid screen use before bedtime.•Educators and teachers should know and promote the movement behaviour guidelines, and embrace opportunities to incorporate healthy movement messages, practices, and policies into daily home-school routines and lessons—eg, when scheduling online lessons, limit prolonged sitting and encourage changes in posture such as regularly standing, stretching, or moving on the spot.•Health professionals should understand and recommend the current guidelines to parents, family members, and caregivers and reinforce their positive association with children's health during all visits, including remote contacts and telemedicine.•Governments should promote healthy movement behaviours in children as part of response strategies and public messaging, and should engage influential people in promotion of such messages.•The media should provide regular messages to promote physical activity and break up extended periods of sitting.•Children should speak up and advocate for their right to a healthy, active life, while carefully observing pandemic restrictions. Forming peer groups can help with maintaining healthy movement behaviour patterns.View Large\n",

      "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was announced as a global pandemic by WHO on 11 March, 2020. Although COVID-19 is not life-threatening in most people, it can be lethal for others. The exact mortality rate varies greatly between regions and countries, particularly with an increased risk of death in people aged 70 years and older.1Lloyd-Sherlock P Ebrahim S Geffen L McKee M Bearing the brunt of covid-19: older people in low and middle income countries.BMJ. 2020; 368m1052Google Scholar Because of its high transmissibility, COVID-19 has challenged health-care systems worldwide, leading to pressure on intensive care beds in Italy with 9–11% of the people infected with COVID-19 requiring intensive care admission.2Remuzzi A Remuzzi G COVID-19 and Italy: what next?.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1225-1228Google Scholar As a result, countries took various actions to flatten the curve to allow health-care systems to cope with the demand.On 23 March, 2020, the UK Government released “Guidance for social distancing for everyone in the UK”. This guidance, among others, is much needed to reduce infection and potential spread of COVID-19. Within this guidance, several factors are identified as increasing a person's vulnerability of severe illness, and as a result, efforts to maintain social distancing is to be more stringent for these groups.One factor that has been identified as increasing a person's vulnerability of severe illness is a BMI of 40kg/m2 or higher, a cutoff that was also listed as an independent risk factor by the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although it is recognised that a higher BMI has been associated with greater risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, all of which are predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19,3Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062Google Scholar to date, no available data show adverse COVID-19 outcomes specifically in people with a BMI of 40kg/m2 or higher. This absence of data might explain why, unlike with other factors identified as reasons for a higher-risk status, there is a paucity of information to explain the reason why people with a BMI of 40kg/m2 or higher, as an independent risk factor, are included as a high-risk group. In comparison, information about the reasons that a person with diabetes is at an increased risk of severe illness have been shared widely between people living with diabetes, health-care workers, and community support networks.The scarcity of information regarding the increased risk of illness for people with a BMI higher than 40kg/m2 has led to ambiguity and might increase anxiety, given that these individuals have now been categorised as vulnerable to severe illness if they contract COVID-19. Similarly, and of concern, is that the BMI cutoff (≥40kg/m2) might give false safety for people with obesity at lower BMIs. Thus, there is a need for more evidence and information to raise awareness of why a BMI of 40kg/m2 or higher has been identified as a cutoff for increased risk of severe illness as a result of COVID-19, and also for health-care practitioners, organisations, and charities to inform and care for individuals seeking support.We declare no competing interests.\n",
      "BackgroundIn the early stages of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China, the local health-care system was overwhelmed.

As the epidemic progressed in Hubei province, more local health-care providers joined the epidemic control efforts, and 42 000 health-care providers (including 28 600 nurses) from across China came to Hubei to support them.3National Health Commission of the People's Republic of ChinaPress conference of the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council on Feb 29, 2020.

Intensive training is necessary for health-care providers without infectious disease expertise.While being quarantined at home and not able to provide frontline care at the height of the coronavirus outbreak, we wanted to make sure the experiences of these frontline health-care providers who had no infectious disease expertise were not lost. Therefore, we aimed to describe the experiences of these physicians and nurses caring for COVID-19 in the early stages of the outbreak.We did a qualitative study through telephone interviews. An empirical phenomenological approach was used to obtain detailed descriptions of the experiences of physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise in providing patient care during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei, China. The focus of phenomenological research is to describe commonalities of experiences across a population.Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. Physicians or nurses who were recruited from their original departments to provide direct care and treatment for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. The sample size was determined by data saturation—ie, at the point where no new themes from participants' experiences emerged. Five participants were already known by one of the two interviewers and the rest were approached through snowball sampling. Variation in years of work experience, number of support days, and hospital of employment were considered to obtain diversity in the experiences of caring for patients with COVID-19.Ethics approval for this research was received from the institutional review board at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (WDRY2020-K004). The study objectives and voluntary nature of the study were explained to participants, and oral informed consent was obtained before each telephone interview. Confidentiality was assured by using numbers instead of names (eg, physician P1, P2, etc and nurse N1, N2, etc) and removing identifying information from the transcripts. All audio recordings and transcripts were saved on a password-protected computer. Throughout this study, we followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines.Semi-structured, in-depth telephone interviews were done at a time convenient for participants between Feb 10 and Feb 15, 2020. With participant permission, all interviews were audio-recorded. Participants' age, marital status, years of work experience, original department, the date they started working on the COVID-19 ward, and number of days they worked on the COVID-19 ward before the interview was obtained at the start of the interview. A broad data-generating question was first used: “Please tell me about your experiences of taking care of patients with COVID-19.” Open-ended follow-up questions were used to obtain detailed descriptions, and examples were: “what is the difference between providing care due to the epidemic and working in your original department”; “how did you feel on the first day”; “how are you feeling now”; “what challenges did you encounter”; “how did you respond”; “what external support have you received”; and “what other support do you need?” Probing questions, such as “Please tell me more about that”, were used to enhance the depth of discussion.Data collection occurred concurrently with data analysis. The audio recordings were transcribed verbatim by a transcription company within 24 h of the interviews and reviewed by the interviewers for accuracy. The interviews, original transcriptions, and data analysis were in Chinese. During the data analysis, all authors agreed with the results and chose the highlighted quotations. All quotations were translated into English by QL and back translated by DL to ensure that meaning was retained.Haase's adaptation of Colaizzi's method was used to analyse transcripts.8Colaizzi PF Psychological research as the phenomenologist views it.in: Valle RS King M Existential-phenomenological alternatives for psychology.

Credibility was achieved by in-depth interviews followed by peer debriefing. Two coauthors analysed the transcripts independently by bracketing data on preconceived ideas and strictly following the adapted Colaizzi's method described above. Findings were then compared and discussed by the team until consensus on themes, theme clusters, and categories was achieved. Transferability was established by considering variations of participant characteristics and sufficient quotations collected through in-depth interviews. The audit trail was maintained to ensure all analysis steps could be traced back to original interviews.The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.Our sample consisted of nine nurses and four physicians recruited from five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Hubei province in February, 2020. Three physicians and one nurse declined to participate in the study due to their high level of fatigue. All participants took care of patients with COVID-19 in the hospitals in which they were employed. They joined COVID-19 wards at different times, from mid-January to early February, and their time working on these wards before the interviews ranged from 4 to 33 days; 12 of the 13 participants were still working at the time their interviews were done (table). Thematic redundancy was achieved with the 11th interview, and two participants were then interviewed to confirm thematic redundancy. Interviews lasted about 20–60 min (mean 38·62 min, SD 13·16).TableCharacteristics of participantsAge, yearsGenderMarital statusWork experience, yearsOriginal departmentCOVID-19 ward start dateDays worked on COVID-19 ward before interviewNurse 134FemaleMarried13StomatologyJan 2012Nurse 236FemaleMarried13OncologyJan 2516Nurse 327FemaleSingle3·5OncologyJan 2816Nurse 430FemaleSingle7NeurosurgeryFeb 211Nurse 532FemaleMarried9OncologyFeb 49Nurse 623MaleSingle2NeurosurgeryJan 3114Nurse 723FemaleSingle3NeurosurgeryFeb 114Nurse 832FemaleMarried10NeurosurgeryJan 1333Nurse 922MaleSingle2NeurosurgeryFeb 97Physician 139MaleDivorced13AnaesthesiaFeb 85Physician 236MaleMarried6OncologyFeb 112Physician 342MaleMarried17NeurologyJan 2422Physician 437FemaleMarried10NeurologyFeb 510COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\n",

Resilience amid challengesA.Many sources of social support to cope with the situationB.TranscendenceWe named the first theme cluster within the first category “a call to duty: joining the fight”. Nine of the 13 participants volunteered and four were asked and agreed to care for patients with COVID-19. From mid-January to early February, 2020, their frontline colleagues had been stretched thin as the virus rapidly progressed. Health-care providers from other departments felt that when they were most needed by their country and people, they were duty-bound to align with and work with health-care providers on the frontline to save lives.“We must try our best to win this battle. As health-care providers, we are at the forefront. I fight for my family, and I fight more for this society.” (N2)“This is my duty because I am a medical worker. No matter what will happen…” (N3)The second theme cluster identified was “treating and caring for patients—managing both mundane and extraordinarily difficult situations”. Physicians and nurses were determined to provide the best care to patients in their respective roles. Physicians assessed patients during rounds, chose different respiratory treatment methods, evaluated and adjusted therapeutic regimens, and documented their care. Because COVID-19 was an unknown illness, they followed the diagnosis and treatment guidelines released by the National Health Commission, while also drawing on previous clinical experiences and learning through exploration.“We try to deeply understand the guidelines released by the country, discuss with other colleagues to know their experiences in treating patients with COVID-19, then transform the knowledge and experience to use for our patients. We keep exploring.” (P1)Nurses had the closest contact with patients and spent much of their time providing intensive care. They made efforts to minimise complications by frequent assessment, management of airways, tubes, medications, chest physical therapy, and positioning. Additionally, when patients were unable to take care of themselves, nurses assisted with patients' activities of daily living, including offering nutrition and fluids, meeting elimination needs, and providing oral hygiene and skin care.“Severe patients need help from various respiratory therapies, such as high flow oxygen therapy and ventilators. We are busy all day. We try to assess patients frequently, ask patients whether they feel uncomfortable and adjust various parameters of the ventilator in time.” (N6)“Every patient has to stay in their room, so their activities of daily living are all facilitated by nurses, such as getting food and water. When severely ill patients cannot get out of bed without oxygen, we need to assist them to use bedpans.” (N3)Physicians and nurses collaborated, and they respected their team members' hard work and contribution.“We enter isolation wards during rounds; if patients' conditions are stable, we leave and give orders and do not enter isolation wards again. All the orders are implemented by nurses through the most direct contact with patients... Wearing such thick protective suits and staying in the wards for a six-hour-shift will cause severe dyspnoea. So, nurses are very tough. I always respect nurses, now I feel we are more closely connected.” (P2)The third cluster identified was “supporting patients emotionally—‘treating the patient, not just the disease’”. Quarantined patients were not accompanied by their family and only saw medical staff in protective suits for a long time. Health-care providers recognised that isolation could cause psychological problems that, if not addressed in time, could lead to severe consequences. Therefore, health-care providers emphasised the need for emotional support and conscientiously integrated it into their care. No matter how busy they were, they made efforts to comfort and relieve patients' emotional burdens.“Patients are struggling to breathe, and some can only lie in bed. They are very helpless and want care from their families.” (N9)“We are not treating the disease, we are treating the patient. Many patients have severe anxiety and we need to deal with this.” (P1)“I comforted the patient while I gave the injection, [I told him] ‘Patients who were more serious finally recovered.’ I wanted to give him some hope and kept encouraging him, ‘We will not give up on you. You cannot give up on yourself either’… Then he felt better.” (N4)The second category of themes, “challenges of working on COVID-19 wards”, consisted of five clusters relating to the workload and stresses of treating patients with COVID-19 and adapting to a new working environment. Although health-care providers carried on with their duties, they also experienced their own physical and emotional stresses, common to other people. None of the participants had previous experience with an infectious disease and entering the isolation ward was viewed as oppressive and stressful. The restricted zoning, disinfection efforts, and isolation measures were reminders that they were caring for patients with an infectious disease.“I felt very depressed on the first day in the infectious disease hospital because there was only one entrance and passage for medical staff, and it is a real isolation unit with negative pressure. I felt it was difficult to breathe… This new environment brought a sense of oppression.” (N9)Due to the surge of patients, many regular wards that were not initially designed for infectious diseases were modified into isolation wards within a short time. Some did not meet the criteria of infectious disease units or lacked equipment when they were set up.“This infectious department is modified from a clinical drug trial centre, and the layout is quite different from regular wards. The layout of the clean, contaminated, and semi-contaminated zones did not fully meet the standards. Also, in the first week, we lacked many supplies and equipment and needed to borrow from other units.” (N6)Initially, health-care providers were nervous and lacked confidence in caring for patients with this new disease. The risk, transmissibility, pathogenicity, and treatment of the disease were not well understood. Some health-care providers had no experience working in an intensive care unit or dealing with critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation, so they needed to learn and master new technical procedures in a short time.“I have to treat many patients who are not in my specialty. Although the country has released six editions of diagnosis and treatment guidelines [for COVID-19], there is still no effective antiviral medicine. It is an unknown disease, and everyone feels powerless.” (P2)“Many patients with dyspnoea need high-flow oxygen therapy, ventilators, and prone position ventilation. Some of these are beyond my expertise, which makes me a little stressful.” (N2)Most team members were from different specialties, and some teams included health-care providers from other provinces. While working together, communication and collaboration with a new multidisciplinary team were challenging because different sites had different protocols, and they had to rapidly find ways to work together efficiently.“I work with the medical team from [name of different province] and nurses from different departments in our hospital. It is stressful. We had to find ways to make the whole process as smooth as possible and ensure the quality of care.” (N2)“Physicians and nurses come from different departments. We did not collaborate well in the first week. Prescribing and processing orders was a little messy.” (N6)In the early stages of the outbreak, before health-care providers from across China had arrived, health-care providers in Hubei province were exhausted owing to the intensive care they provided during long shifts in protective suits without toilet breaks. Their workloads increased substantially when caring for critically ill patients. When providers' shifts were over, they often went straight to their living quarters, collapsed, and did not want to move.“I was very tired. I had to lie in bed for a whole day to recover from the fatigue after work.” (N3)“I am very tired and fall asleep quickly when I get back home.” (P3)Providers repeatedly expressed that working with personal protective equipment (PPE) for long hours was a major physical and professional challenge. Because of the airtight protective gear, they sweated and their clothes became wet. The hospital central heating system was turned off to minimise the circulation of contaminated air, and wet clothes became cold at night because the epidemic occurred in winter. Providers also experienced anoxia and chest pain while in their PPE.“Wearing the whole set of PPEs is very uncomfortable. I have difficulty breathing and feel very hot and my heart rate speeds up. We keep on sweating and the clothes are soaked.” (N5)“I sweat after wearing the protective gear for a while or when I move, such as turning patients. Then I feel clammy.” (N8)Because caregivers were weighed down by the PPE, their movement was clumsy and their protective goggles became blurred quickly, which made the work much more difficult.“It feels clumsy to walk and do procedures. Although I am good at venepuncture, I cannot feel blood vessels to draw blood with three layers of gloves even when I palpate carefully. My glasses and protective goggles are blurry because I am hot, and it is very difficult to do things, such as writing nursing notes and medication administration. I must hold the medicine close to the face shield to read the words on it. I am very anxious and irritable, because I have so much work to do but I can't see well.” (N5)Participants thought that their heavy workloads were related to the shortage of medical protective supplies. To ensure all health-care providers were fully protected in isolation wards, hospital managers had to limit the number of health-care providers. To save time and protective supplies, health-care providers did not eat or drink to avoid going to the restroom during working hours.“Sufficient protective supplies are the most important. We have limited frontline medical staff because of insufficient protective supplies. If you cannot protect yourself, how can you treat patients? You will become a source of infection.” (P1)“To extend the use of protective suits, we do not eat or drink during the 6-hour shift to avoid using the restroom. Every hospital does not have enough supplies, and we are trying our best to save them.” (N9)Providers' heavy workloads also related to the insufficient number of health-care providers, so they wanted more health-care providers to relieve the physical challenges and ensure the quality of care.“We do not know when we will be so fatigued that we cannot work at all… Our head nurse tries to coordinate the personnel to replace us; however, many medics are drafted to support the newly erected [name of infectious disease hospital], so the workforce of the whole hospital is very limited.” (N6)“A larger workforce is needed. One's energy is limited, but each patient wants attention.” (P1)Due to the highly contagious nature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and lack of understanding of its transmission, health-care providers were constantly in fear of becoming infected. When participants heard that health-care providers from general wards were infected due to insufficient protection and awareness about the virus at the beginning of the outbreak, they had to consider whether they also had contact with any patients or colleagues in their original department who were diagnosed with COVID-19.“I recently contacted a colleague without any protection, who was later diagnosed with COVID-19. Although my CT results did not show any abnormality, I am anxious and waiting to do the throat swab.” (N7)Although well protected in the isolation wards, health-care providers were afraid of unintentional occupational exposure and of transmitting the virus to their colleagues; they consistently monitored their own health to avoid infecting others. Providers who lived with families also had great concern about taking the virus to their family members, especially their children and parents.“To protect other medics, we are fearful of being infected. Anyone who coughs in the office causes panic. If one is infected, all medics in the unit are in danger, then the unit will be paralysed.” (P1)“Every morning I swallow hard to feel if I have a sore throat. I take my temperature repeatedly… When taking off the PPE, I always review the steps in my mind. I fear doing it wrong and having occupational exposure.” (P4)“I lived at home. I was anxious, wondering if I brought the virus home and spread it to my family. My child is so young, what if she is infected?” (N1)Health-care providers' moods fluctuated with their patients' conditions. They were happy and felt great relief when the patients' conditions improved. However, when they tried their best but patients' conditions showed no improvement or deteriorated, they felt depressed and had a deep sense of powerlessness.“When I talk with patients who are recovering, I am more relaxed because treatments are effective. But when patients have a persistent fever without obvious improvement, or their condition deteriorates, I am very depressed when I enter their room.” (P1)“The condition of elderly patients changes rapidly, and they may have respiratory failure suddenly. You will feel that, oh my god, there are few opportunities to save lives! The sense of powerlessness is the biggest distress. It makes me very depressed.” (P4)When patients died, their health-care provider experienced emotional distress and grief for the patient and their family. Additionally, when providers had to prioritise care needs, they often felt that they had failed their patients.“When a patient with an infectious disease dies, the body is wrapped in several layers of cloth, packed into two bags, which are sprayed with disinfectant... It is a little hard to accept this form of death.” (N2)“There was a man whose parents died on the same day. He cried beside his mother's bed and said his parents were healthy previously, but he lost both of them due to this sudden disease. The scene was really painful, I cried. For a few days, the critical and intensive care unit had patients die every day, two even died on the same day. I feel very depressed. When is the end?” (N5)“We have many patients but limited protective suits, and we cannot tolerate wearing protective suits for long hours. So, I can only focus on important problems and am less concerned with other issues. I feel sorry about that.” (P4)Some health-care providers felt challenged to have good relationships with patients, because it was more difficult to communicate when they were in such a stressful situation. Other health-care providers felt their relationships with patients were enhanced when patients expressed appreciation for their willingness to put themselves at risk to provide care to them, even when providing the care was difficult.“If you are not good at communicating and do not know how to comfort patients, the doctor–patient relationship will be very bad. I think we need professional training in psychological communication skills.” (P1)“I needed to establish an intravenous line for a patient with poor perfusion; it was cold that day and wearing the PPE made the work harder. I failed to get a line six times and I apologised to him, but he said, ‘I know you did your best’. He was grateful to us for taking great risks to take care of them [patients with COVID-19]. Nurses and patients understand each other, and the relationship is much better than usual.” (N4)The third theme category consisted of two clusters: “many sources of social support to cope with the situation” and “transcendence”. Health-care providers identified multiple support systems, including their hospitals, colleagues, families, friends, and society. With logistical support from their hospital and peer support and encouragement among colleagues, they had a sense of safety and felt they were not alone. Talking to their significant others about their work experiences was also helpful as another form of support. Providers also appreciated the various forms of social support.“I am not overstrained because I trust our hospital. Our hospital gives us strong logistical support, including providing medical protective supplies, accommodations, transportation, food, medicines, and subsidies.” (N3)“The head nurse knows we come from different departments and infectious disease is not our specialty, so she sent us some educational videos and materials, and we can learn after work.” (N1)“When I feel stressful, I complain to my boyfriend. He is also a nurse, and we are in the same department. We communicate with and understand each other.” (N7)“Many people donate food and fruits to us. I appreciate it.” (N8)Health-care providers also used self-management strategies to maintain a good mood, because they knew they were badly needed. Some of them preferred to focus on their work and pay less attention to information about COVID-19 to avoid being upset by the negative situations around them. Some chose to do relaxing activities and find a moment of peace, such as watching films, taking a shower, and reading. Owing to the heavy workloads, they also recognised the need for good nutrition and rest.“I must adjust myself because I cannot be immersed in sadness, I must focus on combating the epidemic, and take efforts to save more lives, win the battle, and help everyone to return to a normal life.” (N9)“I like reading, watching movies, and writing. After work, many physicians returned to their own room in the hotel, and they were alone. I told them to do something they like after work, rather than keep thinking about the work.” (P2)“To keep up with the workload, the most important thing after work is to eat and sleep to replenish strength.” (P4)Although hospitals and the government provided a series of measures to maintain the psychological wellbeing of health-care providers amid COVID-19, they did not think their emotional pressure was serious enough for psychological counselling or hotline assistance.“The hospital has set up an online psychological counselling group. The psychiatric department sent some videos to the group to help us cope with bad emotions. There is also a psychological assistance hotline. I have watched the videos, but I have not called the hotline.” (N1)Health-care providers found meaning in their experiences. They were proud of themselves for the courage and potential to overcome difficulties. They also began to think about what was important to them and wanted to cherish the present.“This is a special experience, I am lucky to have joined this team and to be combating the virus… I feel that I still have potential, I have become qualified for this challenging job within a short time.” (N1)“I am proud that I do not hesitate in the face of risks and danger. My awareness of self-protection and communication skills have also improved.” (P1)“I cherish life, because I don't know when an accident will happen.” (N3)Pervasive throughout health-care providers' descriptions of their lived experiences of battling COVID-19 was a sense of responsibility to alleviate patients' suffering and a need to make concerted efforts to safeguard the whole country from the virus. In China, there is an old saying, “Everyone is responsible for his country's rise or fall.” In the face of this unknown disease and unpredictable risks, health-care providers feared infection and worried about their families, but they still applied to join the fight, took up their responsibilities, concentrated on their duties, and showed a spirit of unity and professional dedication.Young health-care providers were the backbone of the COVID-19 crisis in China. Of the 28 600 nurses recruited from across China to provide care to patients with COVID-19 in Hubei, 90% were younger than 40 years, and 40% were younger than 30 years.10National Health Commission of the People's Republic of ChinaPress conference of the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council on April 7, 2020.

The condition of the critically ill patients with COVID-19 changed rapidly, and they often had many complications combined with multiple organ failure. Similar to many new infectious diseases of global health concern, such as Ebola, no effective medicines exist, and patient care is primarily supportive nursing care.11McGillis Hall L Kashin J Public understanding of the role of nurses during Ebola.J Nurs Scholarsh. 2016; 48: 91-97Google Scholar Therefore, nurses have heavy workloads that include comprehensive assessment and monitoring, rapid recognition and response to clinical deterioration, close communication and collaboration with physicians, symptomatic care, psychological support, and prevention of multiple potential complications.In general, Chinese family members or family-paid caregivers have a role in bedside care and assisting with activities of daily living for hospitalised patients that are not in intensive care units, and patients view this family care as important psychological support while they are ill.12Gillick MR The critical role of caregivers in achieving patient-centered care.JAMA. 2013; 310: 575-576Google Scholar,  13Hui J Wenqin Y Yan G Family-paid caregivers in hospital health care in China.J Nurs Manag. 2013; 21: 1026-1033Google Scholar Owing to the isolation policy in place during the COVID-19 outbreak, family members or family-paid caregivers could not accompany patients, and only nurses took responsibility for basic care. Although a majority (68%) of frontline health-care providers were nurses, they still had heavy workloads.3National Health Commission of the People's Republic of ChinaPress conference of the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council on Feb 29, 2020.

Intensive work for long hours made health-care providers at risk of decreased immunity. When health-care workers became sick, there was concern regarding their ability to curb the outbreak and treat patients. When a health-care crisis as large as SARS-CoV-2 occurs, it is important for authorities to emphasise the importance of self-care, set maximal working hours and arrange shifts reasonably to protect health-care providers from overwork.14Adams JG Walls RM Supporting the health care workforce during the COVID-19 global epidemic.JAMA. 2020;  (published online March 12.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.3972Google ScholarPatients with COVID-19 need both comprehensive and specific management, and the outbreak brings great challenges to health-care systems, especially critical care medicine. Many health-care providers from other departments had few clinical experiences in infectious intensive care. When health-care systems are not ready to handle the outbreak of an infectious disease, training, education, and improved communication are needed.15Speroni KG Seibert DJ Mallinson RK Nurses' perceptions on Ebola care in the United States, part 2: a qualitative analysis.J Nurs Adm. 2015; 45: 544-550Google Scholar Temporary efforts to provide intensive training increased caregiver knowledge and skills. Continuous medical education and training is needed to assure medical teams are adequately prepared to deal with public health emergencies.16Li L Xv Q Yan J COVID-19: the need for continuous medical education and training.Lancet Respir Med. 2020;  (published online March 16.)DOI:10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30125-9Google ScholarWhen personnel from different specialties and hospitals work together, differences might exist in corporate cultures, procedures, and communication. The promotion of interprofessional and interorganisational collaboration should be a priority to ensure efficient and high-quality care. Nurses have a leading role in facilitating communication and collaboration among health-care team members; mutual trust and respectful environments should be developed, efficient communication maintained, the role of individuals and teams clarified, standardised procedures established, and a sense of belonging fostered.17Karam M Brault I Van Durme T Macq J Comparing interprofessional and interorganizational collaboration in healthcare: a systematic review of the qualitative research.Int J Nurs Stud. 2018; 79: 70-83Google ScholarIn the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, because of insufficient understanding of the virus and prevention and control measures, more than 3000 medical staff were infected in Hubei, 40% of whom were infected in hospitals.18State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of ChinaPress conference of the prevention, control and treatment progress of COVID-19 on March 6, 2020.

Infection among health-care workers has been a problem during other outbreaks. During the SARS epidemic, nurses' higher levels of trust in equipment or infection control initiatives were related to lower levels of emotional exhaustion and state anger.19Marjanovic Z Greenglass ER Coffey S The relevance of psychosocial variables and working conditions in predicting nurses' coping strategies during the SARS crisis: an online questionnaire survey.Int J Nurs Stud. 2007; 44: 991-998Google Scholar Workforce safety is a high priority. To help health-care providers reduce uncertainty and fear, in addition to improving knowledge of infection prevention and control and personal protection skills, hospitals need to provide a safe working environment and sufficient protective supplies and have personnel responsible for continuous training, monitoring, and supervision of infection prevention and control. Sound infection prevention practices are also needed in the living quarters of medical teams from other provinces. For frontline health-care providers who lived at home, the concerns about transmitting the virus to family members need to be addressed. Supportive conversations and recommendations, such as separation of living spaces, changing clothing, and immediately showering after duty, might help to reduce anxiety.14Adams JG Walls RM Supporting the health care workforce during the COVID-19 global epidemic.JAMA. 2020;  (published online March 12.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.3972Google ScholarIn the face of various challenges, health-care providers showed great strength and resilience. They used multiple support systems and self-adjustment skills to relieve stress, because they knew they needed to be strong and focus on their duty in order to save more lives. However, health-care providers in this study also expressed grief and a strong sense of powerlessness about patients' suffering and the sudden loss of lives. During the SARS and MERS epidemics, frontline health-care providers were fearful, anxious, and frustrated and were at higher risk of mental health problems after the epidemic (eg, post-traumatic stress disorder).5Lee SM Kang WS Cho A-R Kim T Park JK Psychological impact of the 2015 MERS outbreak on hospital workers and quarantined hemodialysis patients.Compr Psychiatry. 2018; 87: 123-127Google Scholar,  6Maunder R Hunter J Vincent L et al.The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital.CMAJ. 2003; 168: 1245-1251Google Scholar,  19Marjanovic Z Greenglass ER Coffey S The relevance of psychosocial variables and working conditions in predicting nurses' coping strategies during the SARS crisis: an online questionnaire survey.Int J Nurs Stud. 2007; 44: 991-998Google Scholar Although participants in this study thought they were able to deal with their emotional stress without professional support, their mental health should be continuously monitored, support systems strengthened, and professional psychological counselling and crisis interventions provided.Owing to strict infection prevention measures, non-essential personnel, such as psychiatrists and psychotherapists, are discouraged from entering isolation wards.20Duan L Zhu G Psychological interventions for people affected by the COVID-19 epidemic.Lancet Psychiatry. 2020; 7: 300-302Google Scholar Psychological care was mainly provided by frontline health-care providers, who had heavy workloads and did not have professional training in mental health care. Health-care providers in this study tried their best to provide psychological support to patients. Considering the importance of psychological care to quarantined patients, professional training on psychological care and communication for health-care providers will be helpful to deal with patients' emotional problems.21Chen Q Liang M Li Y et al.Mental health care for medical staff in China during the COVID-19 outbreak.Lancet Psychiatry. 2020; 7: e15-e16Google ScholarA limitation of this study was that all participants were interviewed by telephone, because Wuhan was in lockdown and the authors could not go to hospitals. It was more difficult to build rapport with participants over the phone, and non-verbal cues could not be obtained. The semi-structured interview guide was not piloted, but the interviewers were trained in interview skills before this study, and each interview was followed by peer debriefing. The sample composition was uneven, with nine nurses and four physicians. However, the authors did not aim to compare experiences between nurses and physicians, and among those health-care providers working in COVID-19 wards, 68% were nurses, so the sample composition seemed reasonable.In treating patients with COVID-19, Chinese health-care providers showed a great deal of professional dedication and acceptance of the need to place themselves at risk and to overwork. Nurses took on difficult tasks and had an important role in promoting patients' recovery. The intensive work drained health-care providers physically and emotionally; therefore comprehensive support should be provided to safeguard the wellbeing of health-care providers and preparedness and efficacy promoted to manage crises.ContributorsAll authors had full access to all the data in this study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

      "Governments worldwide are currently deliberating the feasibility of a national shutdown strategy to contain and mitigate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on their country's population. Testing for COVID-19 is mainly being done among at-risk individuals (eg, those with influenza-like symptoms, people who have had contact with an individual testing positive for COVID-19, health-care professionals, or those with a travel history to an affected region),1Indian Council of Medical Research Department of Health ResearchStrategy for COVID19 testing in India, version 4.https://icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Strategey_for_COVID19_Test_v4_09042020.pdfDate: April 9, 2020Date accessed: April 23, 2020Google Scholar thus an accurate value for how many individuals are truly infected is not known. Since at-risk individuals are not representative of the general population, it is impossible to obtain the true prevalence of COVID-19 in the population. Yet, establishing this value is vital to understand the morbidity and mortality risk in the population, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India, which cannot absorb the socioeconomic and public-health fallout resulting from national shutdowns.In the absence of universal testing, a random-sample-based population surveillance framework is urgently needed. We propose using the well established Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) framework as a solution to ascertain the true prevalence of COVID-19. We use as an example the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), India's version of the DHS that is led by the International Institute of Population Sciences under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.2International Institute for Population SciencesNational Family Health Survey, India: about NFHS.http://rchiips.org/nfhs/about.shtmlDate accessed: April 22, 2020Google ScholarIn 2002, India was projected to have 25 million HIV-positive individuals, with a prevalence of HIV in adults of 3–4%.3Gordon DF The next wave of HIV/AIDS: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Russia, India, and China.https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3f03/3cc3622f18c6972660dd19fdf2d3ba409606.pdf?_ga=2.198668143.1342463162.1586366906-700348898.1586366906Date: September, 2002Date accessed: April 23, 2020Google Scholar These estimates were based on extrapolation of infection rates among selected at-risk individuals. India used the NFHS to test for HIV in the general population, and estimates were sharply reduced to 2·5 million, with a prevalence of HIV in adults (aged 15–49 years) of 0·28%.4International Institute for Population SciencesHIV prevalence.http://rchiips.org/nfhs/NFHS-3%20Data/VOL-1/Chapter%2012%20-%20HIV%20Prevalence%20(422K).pdfDate accessed: April 23, 2020Google Scholar This discrepancy showed the shortcomings of selective testing of at-risk individuals as the basis for understanding disease prevalence in a population.5Subramanian SV Corsi DJ Subramanyam MA Smith GD Jumping the gun: the problematic discourse on socioeconomic status and cardiovascular health in India.Int J Epidemiol. 2013; 42: 1410-1426Google ScholarThe NFHS has state-of-the-art infrastructure with a ready sampling framework. For more than 25 years the NFHS has served India well, providing reliable estimates of various population, health, and nutrition indicators. Layering a COVID-19-focused data-collection effort onto the NFHS infrastructure would keep operational costs low, with the major expense being laboratory costs for testing samples.We estimated the minimum required sample of individuals who would need to be tested under three scenarios of anticipated COVID-19 prevalence in the population. Under a scenario of 0·5% prevalence, we would only need a sample of about 3000 individuals to be tested. The minimum required sample size increases to just over 15 000 under a rarer scenario of 0·1% prevalence and decreases to about 1500 if the anticipated prevalence is 1%. Should the anticipated prevalence of COVID-19 be any higher than 1%, the minimum sample size needed to reliably estimate the true prevalence would be smaller and, therefore, fewer resources would be needed.This sampling approach could be implemented at state or district levels without great changes in the required sample size, unless we presumed a different anticipated prevalence for a specific state or district. The minimum sample sizes presented here are based on a simple random sampling strategy. Further appropriate stratifications and clustering of individuals by households would need to be considered.India is not alone in its inability to establish the true number of infected individuals in the country. Using an existing rich data-science infrastructure, India and other countries with established DHS sampling frames can provide vital data and insights to help guide an appropriate response to COVID-19, and show vision and leadership to prepare for the next pandemic.We declare no competing interests.\n",

The researchers explored sufficient information to show what Chinese health-care providers had experienced and found that they had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and a strong spirit of teamwork when treating patients with COVID-19. Despite facing physical and psychological challenges, such as physical exhaustion due to heavy workloads, a lack of personal protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, and feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, health-care providers showed amazing resilience. Moreover, this study provides a holistic picture of health-care providers' experiences for the international community and emphasises that sufficient personal protective equipment, reasonable work schedules, an effective communication environment, monitoring and supervision of infection control, and professional psychological support are necessary to improving the experiences of health-care providers.The authors also acknowledge some limitations of the study. First, a phone interview method was used owing to the lockdown in Wuhan. Thus, non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, eye contact, and body movements, which are unique data resources for a qualitative study, were not recorded. Future studies should collect as much non-verbal information as possible, which could enrich the descriptions of health care providers' experiences. Second, the authors did not compare the experiences of nurses and physicians. Physicians, nurses, and other medical staff are all working together in the fight against COVID-19, but they have different duties and their experiences might differ from each other.3Brooks SK Dunn R Amlôt R Rubin GJ Greenberg N A systematic, thematic review of social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in healthcare employees during an infectious disease outbreak.J Occup Environ Med. 2018; 60: 248-257Google Scholar Hence, we recommend expanding the sample size to improve the diversity and representativeness of the sample. Different research methods could also be used to build a more complete picture of health-care providers' experiences and compare the different experiences of nurses and physicians (as well as other groups, such as pharmacists and respiratory therapists), based on the previous study.As the results of this study showed, as well as the results of similar studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome,4Chou TL Ho LY Wang KY Kao CW Yang MH Fan PL Uniformed service nurses' experiences with the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and response in Taiwan.Nurs Clin North Am. 2010; 45: 179-191Google Scholar,  5Kim Y Nurses' experiences of care for patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus in South Korea.Am J Infect Control. 2018; 46: 781-787Google Scholar frontline health-care providers face enormous pressure during outbreaks due to a variety of factors, including a high risk of infection, insufficient personal protective equipment, heavy workloads and manpower shortages, confusion, discrimination, isolation, patients with negative emotions, separation from their families, and burnout. These pressures can lead to mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear, which not only affect health-care providers' attention, understanding, and decision-making ability, but could also have a lasting effect on their physical and psychological wellbeing after the COVID-19 crisis is over.6Ayanian JZ Mental health needs of health care workers providing frontline COVID-19 care.

      "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide because of the large numbers of patients, a scarcity of resources, the poor prognosis of patients they treat, and uncertainty regarding the disease's pathogenesis. The first case of COVID-19 in the Netherlands was confirmed on Feb 27, 2020, and the patient was put on mechanical ventilation in our ICU department at Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, Netherlands). Currently, our department is the largest COVID-19 ICU in the Netherlands. We would like to share our findings regarding a possible mechanism of progressive respiratory failure.From the date of the first confirmed case up to April 5, a total of 90 patients were admitted to our ICU, most of whom were male (n=68 [76%]), of older age (mean age 62 years [SD 14]), and obese (mean body-mass index 29 kg/m2 [SD 5]). Treatment consisted of prone positioning, low tidal volumes, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration according to the higher PEEP, lower fraction of inspired oxygen table,1Brower RG Lanken PN MacIntyre N et al.Higher versus lower positive end-expiratory pressures in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome.N Engl J Med. 2004; 351: 327-336Google Scholar and restrictive fluid management. These methods resulted in low driving pressures, no pneumothoraxes, low vasopressor doses, and weaning from mechanical ventilation approximately 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, some patients (n=17 [19%]) deteriorated within 2 weeks and no longer responded to prone positioning. All of these patients had major pulmonary embolism established by lung CT or cardiac ultrasound.Initially, patients with COVID-19 on our ICU developed increased alveolar capillary permeability and subsequent interstitial oedema. The presence of oedema is illustrated by ground-glass opacities of the lung parenchyma on lung CT.2Shi H Han X Jiang N et al.Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020; 20: 425-434Google Scholar If patients require mechanical ventilation, oxygenation improves following prone positioning, higher PEEP, and restrictive fluid management. Subsequently, their condition might deteriorate suddenly, and pulmonary embolism can occur, detected by contrast-enhanced lung CT scan.3Danzi GB Loffi M Galeazzi G Gherbesi E Acute pulmonary embolism and COVID-19 pneumonia: a random association?.Eur Heart J. 2020;  (published online March 30.)DOI:10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa254Google Scholar On our ICU, five further patients had progressive respiratory failure, in whom we did lung CT and found pulmonary embolism, either located centrally or segmentally, in all cases. In addition, we were confronted with these patients developing deep venous thrombosis, and frequent coagulation of renal replacement therapy filters. We hypothesise that the patients with COVID-19 with pulmonary embolism entered a hypercoagulable state with endothelial activation following an increase in proinflammatory cytokines.An association between increased coagulation status and increased capillary permeability might exist. A plasma D-dimer concentration greater than 4 μg/mL, combined with increasing inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), and loss of response to prone positioning might be useful parameters to identify patients at risk of pulmonary embolism. Based on our early findings in our first 90 patients with COVID-19, we now include D-dimer and IL-6 in our routine laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19, and increase the prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin(nadroparin 5700 IU subcutaneously, from once a day to twice a day).4Tang N Bai H Chen X Gong J Li D Sun Z Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy.J Thromb Haemost. 2020;  (published online March 27.)DOI:10.1111/jth.14817Google Scholar In addition, we do a lung CT even at a low level of suspicion of pulmonary embolism, and we encourage others to do the same.In summary, COVID-19 might be associated with hypercoagulability, and clinicians should consider a pulmonary embolism in cases of progressive respiratory failure.DG has received speakers fees and travel expenses from Dräger, GE Healthcare (medical advisory board 2009–12), Maquet, and Novalung (medical advisory board 2015–18).

      "Italy was the first European country to encounter the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.1Li C Romagnani P von Brunn A Hans-Joachim A SARS-CoV-2 and Europe: timing of containment measures for outbreak control.Infection. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1007/s15010-020-01420-9Google Scholar For people with multiple sclerosis, the situation carries additional reasons for concern. Although emerging work suggests that some coexisting diseases, such as hypertension, might increase the severity of the COVID-19 infection, how less common conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, effect COVID-19 outcomes is still uncertain. Furthermore, immunosuppressive therapies, the mainstay of treatment for multiple sclerosis, might confer additional risks or, on the contrary, confer some protection. Therefore, collecting information to evaluate the relationship between multiple sclerosis and COVID-19 and implement immediate and appropriate protective strategies is crucial. Less crucial, but equally as important, are questions about the long-term effect of this pandemic on psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety (common comorbidities in multiple sclerosis), the patient–physician relationship, the spread of scientific information, the development of new models of care, and the role of patients and patient organisations in the community.The Italian Multiple Sclerosis Society (AISM), the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation (FISM), and the Multiple Sclerosis Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society have set up a programme to help with these crucial elements in the response to COVID-19 in patients with multiple sclerosis. The programme was developed according to suggestions received from a group of neurologists, including health-care workers on the front-line and representatives of the AISM and the FISM. Further initiatives of the programme will also consider the results of an online survey made by the AISM and the FISM aimed at understanding the most pressing needs of people with multiple sclerosis during this pandemic.Here we report the results of the pilot phase of an investigation of COVID-19 among people with multiple sclerosis, based on a core set of data collected from treatment providers through a specifically designed web-based case report form. The core data set includes clinical and demographic characteristics, and information on disease-modifying therapies. To be included, patients had to have symptoms and signs of COVID-19 infection, with or without a positive test (RT-PCR on nasal and pharyngeal swabs).On March 14, 2020, we sent the case report form to more than 200 Italian neurologists from about 90 multiple sclerosis centres across Italy. As of April 7, 2020, we have collected data on 232 patients from 38 centres, 57 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 and 175 of whom had suspected COVID-19 symptoms but did not have a positive test (appendix p 1). Mean follow-up was 12·6 days (SD 7·4).The severity of COVID-19 infection in 232 patients was classified as mild (no pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in 223 (96%), severe (shortness of breath, respiratory rates ≥30 breaths per min, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2:FiO2 <300 mmHg/%, and an increase in lung infiltrates of >50% within 24–48 h) in four (2%), and critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction or failure) in six (3%).2Chinese Center for Disease Control and PreventionThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China.Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020; 41: 145-151Google Scholar Of the six critical patients, one recovered and five died; all had a positive swab (appendix p 2). 21 patients had undergone a 5-day course of methylprednisolone within 3 months before the onset of COVID-19.These results appear to be slightly reassuring and do not seem to contradict guidelines that we and others had already issued on the management of multiple sclerosis treatments in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.3Multiple Sclerosis International FederationGlobal COVID-19 advice for people with MS.http://www.msif.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MSIF-Global-advice-on-COVID-19-for-people-with-MS.docx-1.pdfDate: March, 2020Date accessed: April 23, 2020Google Scholar These data must be considered only preliminary, however, and there is not enough information to speculate about any susceptibility to protection from COVID-19 afforded by disease-modifying therapies. The same is true for the effect of comorbidities, sex, and other medications (beyond just the disease-modifying therapies) that patients with multiple sclerosis might be taking.We will continue to monitor these patients throughout the duration of the pandemic. When a system to record all patients with multiple sclerosis positive for COVID-19 is implemented, more data on the prevalence of these cases can be gathered.Our web-based platform for data collection is available to all colleagues interested in collecting this type of data. Through procedures that are currently being defined, we also aim to make the raw consolidated data from this web-based case report form open access.MPS reports personal fees from Biogen, Merck, Teva, Novartis, Sanofi Genzyme, Roche, GeNeuro, and Medday, outside the submitted work.

      "With a population of over 200 million people, Nigeria is one of the most populous black nations worldwide. As with the rest of the world, Nigeria is currently dealing with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but in a somewhat different fashion.On Feb 27, 2020, the first official case of COVID-19 in Nigeria was announced. The patient was an Italian citizen, who had recently arrived in Lagos from Europe and who, a few days later, tested positive for the disease. In Ogun state, a neighboring state to Lagos, another patient was identified and was discovered to have been in contact with the first patient. Since then, the situation has developed with more cases occurring, regardless of measures initiated by the state and federal government to combat the virus and return to normalcy. As of April 22, there were 873 confirmed cases, 197 recoveries, and 28 deaths.WHO has advised on several methods to help prevent spread of the virus and to save health systems across the world from a complete collapse—eg, health washing, social distancing, and staying at home. However, Nigeria's health system before the pandemic was nearly non-existent. In most of the cities', health systems are completely dilapidated as they have not received adequate attention, and some government officials have contributed to health system collapse by encouraging medical tourism.The federal government of Nigeria enforced an initial 2-week lockdown on March 30, 2020, for three of 36 states (Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja) and, on April 13, extended it another 2 weeks. Shortly after the order was announced by the President, Muhammadu Buhari, there was an uproar among the citizens due to a myriad of concerns. Nigeria, in 2018, was announced by the World Poverty Clock to be the poverty capital of the world, with over 40% of its citizens living below the poverty line. Therefore, a large proportion of the population, especially in the commercial hub of Lagos, live on daily income with no savings to act as a financial buffer during the lockdown. The prospect of staying at home could, therefore, lead to another problem: hunger. Several people, such as Osas, a young plumber who lives and works in the city, have commented on social media about how, despite being fully informed about COVID-19, they still cannot relate to it as much as the hunger being experienced across the country.View Large\n",

      "                                © 2020 Bernard KaluBuhari promised the citizens some palliative measures, which include disbursing of funds and food items to those most affected. But the reality on the ground is a far cry from the promises made; only a small proportion of the population attest to receiving any support. A large number of citizens have disobeyed the lockdown order in the hope of making sales or trying to earn money through other services, but they were apprehended by the police. The combined effort of the police and the military to enforce the lockdown may have caused more deaths than the infection itself.As well as the other negative outcomes attributed to the lockdown, Lagos has seen a huge spike in armed robberies.One has to question whether these aforementioned negative effects override the reasons for the lockdown in the first place: to flatten the curve of infections. According to news from other countries in Africa, the situation in Lagos is almost a perfect mirror of the situation across the whole continent, with the exception of a few countries (eg, Rwanda), where governments have been able to enact effective solutions to the pandemic and provide palliative measures.There are some positives to consider; the private sector, churches, and non-governmental organisations have provided a lot of support to communities across Lagos and the rest of Nigeria. They have facilitated countless distributions of food items to some of the most deprived areas of Lagos. Also, there is hope that the health sector will finally receive the attention it needs from the government in response to the lessons learned from this pandemic. Despite the socioecomonic differences seen across Nigerian communities, there has been a sense of togetherness during this time.View Large\n",

The Nigerian government must aim to protect its citizens and provide them with the necessary commodities or funds to help mitigate the consequences of this pandemic.View Large\n",

      "On Feb 15, 2020, Egypt recorded Africa's first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 12 days later, Nigeria recorded the first sub-Saharan Africa incident. 2 months later, the Comoro Islands and eSwatini are the only two countries of 54 in Africa that are unaffected by the global pandemic, stretching health systems and nearly paralysing economies.The African Centre for Disease Control (Africa CDC), an African Union body partnering with the WHO Regional Office for Africa, is leading broad measures to control COVID-19. The disease has since accelerated in Africa, reaching 27 427 cases, 1298 deaths, and 7474 recoveries as of April 24. Compared with the rest of the world, Africa's infection rates are relatively low, but there is a growing sense of urgency given the acute absence of health-care infrastructure on the continent.Weeks of fighting the pandemic saw African governments following measures backed by scientific advice, such as quarantine of people exposed to confirmed cases. One Cochrane review found that quarantine might avert high proportions of infection and deaths compared with no measures.“It's important to emphasise that we anticipated that this would happen and have been planning for response”, says John Nkengasong, Director of the Africa CDC, in one of his weekly media briefings. Thanks to Africa CDC, 43 laboratories from 43 African countries are now able to test for COVID-19.The response of Africa CDC includes testing and contact tracing. Nkengasong says there is a possibility that 15 million tests will be required in Africa over the next 3 months. A UN Economic Commission for Africa report says about 300 000 Africans could die of COVID-19. Estimates show that the death toll could rise to 3·3 million Africans due to the pandemic spread.African governments have instituted lockdowns, restricted travel, redirected research funding, and asked for donations from local and international funders to buy medicines, testing kits, ventilators, and protective clothing for health workers in anticipation for the worst-case scenario.When COVID-19 infections jumped 6 times in just 8 days from 61 to 402 cases, on March 23, Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's President, announced a national lockdown for 21 days, further extending it for 2 weeks to April 30, gradually easing the lockdown thereafter, to reopen the economy while limiting the spread.“There are so many unknowns about this virus”, Glenda Davison, Head of the Biomedical Sciences Department at Cape Peninsula University of Technology (Cape Town, South Africa) told The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. “However, I do believe that South Africa has taken the right decision to lockdown early in the pandemic.” This early action means that the rate of infection has slowed, giving the country the time, and hopefully the capacity, to treat those that require intensive care unit. She adds, “an increase in cases will continue, but at a slower rate if observance of social distancing continues”. South Africa's townships are overcrowded with people living in informal housing, born out of central business districts, hostels, rural shacks, and periurban settlements (South Africa has a total population of 58 million). “The concern is that the virus has now moved into communities, which are often overcrowded and under-resourced”, says Davison.View Large\n",

      "                                © 2020 Bernard KaluA high prevalence of tuberculosis and HIV in South Africa means a high proportion of the population has compromised immunity, which could change the pattern of the pandemic for South Africa. South Africa is targeting crowded hotspots countrywide with high infection rate potential, deploying 28 000 health-care workers to test everyone, said Salim Abdool Karim, chair of a ministerial advisory group on COVID-19, on April 13.In Nigeria, a private sector-led group, Coalition Against COVID-19, ordered 250 000 tests and 150 000 extraction kits to fast-track molecular testing for COVID-19, and set up isolation centres in the states of Lagos, Kano, Rivers, Borno, and Enugu. The coalition is also renovating hospitals and boosting medical supplies in other states and earmarked food parcels to 1·7 million vulnerable households. In April, Osagie Ehanire, Nigeria's Health Minister, unveiled 12 COVID-19 testing laboratories that can test 1500 samples daily. Ehanire says increased testing capacity would mean the number of cases identified would increase and would include testing contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases.Among Africa's urban population, social distancing is a privilege few can afford. The majority of people live in crowded settlements. For instance, in Zimbabwe, during a 3-week lockdown in April, the shortage of mielie-meal, a basic commodity, saw crowds swarming to shops selling it, completely disregarding social distancing measures. On April 19, Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe's President, extended the lockdown for 2 weeks; however mines are still allowed to resume operations, as one of the main income sources for the country through exports, but all workers must be tested.“We have continued to see a rise in new cases over the past few weeks”, says Fortune Nyasha Nyamande, spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights. “However, the true extent of the pandemic is difficult to assess because of the limited number of tests that have been conducted to date.” Zimbabwe has fewer than 10 intensive care unit beds in public COVID-19 facilities and fewer than 1000 beds hospitalisation capacity.“It was sensible for countries to apply strong social distancing measures, to begin with, to try to buy a bit of time”, says Kevin Marsh, Senior Advisor for the African Academy of Science. In the long term, it will not be possible to maintain lockdowns measures as seen in many European countries, he says. “The risk of economic collapse, shortages of food, and social unrest carry greater risks to health in the long term than direct deaths from COVID-19”, Marsh told The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.As Africa fights to control COVID-19, health systems are severely strained, threatening to reverse progress made with other diseases such as malaria or polio. “We saw with the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa that we lost more people to malaria, for instance, than we lost to the Ebola outbreak. Let us not repeat that with COVID-19”, says Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. The COVID-19 response has already disrupted measles vaccination efforts in Chad, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Sudan, leaving approximately 21 million children unprotected. The lives of about 400 000 children and adolescents in Africa who need tuberculosis treatment each year could be drastically affected if resources are diverted fight COVID-19, says The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union). “BCG and other routine vaccinations for infants and children must continue during any COVID-19 response”, said Grania Brigden, Director of Tuberculosis Department at The Union. “We have to ensure that these children do not become collateral damage of the COVID-19 response”, she said. “The fight against the dual epidemic of tuberculosis and HIV has been going on for decades, in both adults and children in sub-Saharan Africa; and these communities face an unprecedented resurgence in both diseases, which could greatly compound the devastation likely to be caused by the coronavirus”, Dongo says.\n",
      "Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reached South America a little later than other regions, such as Europe and the USA, every country in the continent has now recorded cases of COVID-19. The under-resourced public health systems of these middle-income or lower middle-income countries are inadequately prepared for any large-scale pandemic; many countries hope that the stringent social distancing and quarantine measures adopted will suppress at the least the first wave of cases.The leader of one country stands out for the wrong reasons. Jair Bolsonaro, President of Brazil, is facing protests for his perceived poor handling of the crisis. Despite Brazil having the most cases of COVID-19 across the continent (almost 41 695 cases and 3000 deaths by April 22, 2020), he has consistently downplayed the severity of the pandemic, calling it a “little flu”. He has repeatedly and publicly clashed with state governors around Brazil for their strict implementation of social distancing measures, including the banning of public gatherings and the closure of schools. He has appeared regularly on television addressing the nation regarding the pandemic and has used phrases such as, ”get back to work” and “people die, that's life”. As recently as April 19, he attended a protest against social distancing in the capital Brasilia.On April 17, he fired his embattled federal health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who had won widespread praise for his strictly scientific handling of the pandemic, trying to follow WHO guidance on social distancing. Frequently forced into contradicting the President, many felt it was only a matter of time before Mandetta was dismissed. The new health minister, Nelson Teich, is an oncologist with management experience in the private health system.“Obviously, many doctors are really sorry that the differences between the President and the previous health minister could not be resolved”, says Luciano Cesar Azevedo, Professor of Critical Care and Emergency Medicine at the University of São Paulo and based at Hospital Sirio-Libanes, São Paulo, Brazil. “However, the new health minister is a highly reputable doctor and administrator, with an important scientific background. We believe he and the President will come to an agreement, and that the Ministry of Health will continue to request social isolation and research the best measures to fight COVID-19.”Across Brazil, the public health system has 7·6 intensive care unit (ICU) beds per 100 000 population, rising to 25·5 in the private system, although efforts are underway to create new emergency hospitals, use capacity in hospitals for armed forces, and repurpose wards and increase ICU beds in existing hospitals. For now, three quarters of Brazil's 210 million population can only access the public health system, and there are already signs of strain. João Doria, the Governor of the most populous state of São Paulo, decided on April 17 to extend the lockdown measures to May 10, saying that hospitals both public and private had begun to struggle with the rapid influx of cases.Bolsonaro's stance has also met opposition from other governors, including those he previously considered political allies. Two governors, of the states Rio de Janeiro and Pará, have announced they themselves have COVID-19, underlining the threat to all Brazilians. In this conflict between federal and state governments, Brazil's Supreme Court has confirmed that ultimately, whatever Bolsonaro's opinions, the power to lift lockdowns lies exclusively with state governors and mayors, and the President cannot overrule them.View Large\n",

Worryingly, compared with previous years, Brazil saw an almost 10-times rise in hospitalisations during March this year of influenza-like symptoms, reported to Iinfogripe, a public-health reporting system. “We do not yet know how much of this increase is due to COVID-19 because test results are taking 2–3 weeks to be returned in some parts of Brazil, since official laboratories are overwhelmed”, explains Azevedo. “The fact that this is happening during summer months, not our regular influenza season, makes it a strong possibility that many of these hospitalisations are non-detected COVID cases.”It is thought that many COVID-19 infection clusters across South America began with wealthy travellers returning from Europe. However, Azevedo and his colleagues fear that the demographics of Brazil could see cases soar in poorer populations: almost half the population do not have access to sanitation, and one quarter live in poverty. The cities of Brazil have rich and poor areas side by side, and in the poorest favelas there can be 8–10 people sharing a 2–room house, with no prospect of social distancing. “Add to this our existing problems with dengue fever, malaria, and continuing outbreaks of yellow fever, and you can understand our fears”, he explains.Brazil is also conducting several drug trials for COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine, which has received much media attention (although there is no evidence as yet to suggest it is effective). The trials involve a coalition of major centres of excellence, including Hospital Sirio-Libanes, and will extend to up to 70 hospitals nationwide. These trials are studying the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, corticosteroids, and tocilizumab on long-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 patients. “The studies on hydroxychloroquine were the ones that started first”, explains Azevedo. “We have close to 150 patients enrolled in two trials, but so far we cannot find evidence of an effect. We hope to have the first results by end of May.”Elsewhere in South America, lockdowns have been imposed in all countries, but at different times. In Argentina, the lockdown, which began on March 20, and will extend to at least late April, so far seems to have prevented an explosion of cases—about 3892 cases and 192 deaths at the time of writing. There are fears of an outbreak taking hold among the country's thousands of port workers and grain handlers involved in the crucial agricultural export sector.“Most cases are clustered in big cities; many cases are due to having travelled abroad and contacts of those people. However, now viral circulation in the wider community has begun”, explains Eliza Estenssoro, Hospital Interzonal de General de Agudos San Martin de La Plata, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. “However, our lockdown appears to have prevented a huge surge.”Estenssoro says the Argentinian Government is working with hospitals to increase ICU capacity by 50–100%, as well as rapidly constructing emergency facilities for moderate-severe COVID-19 cases. However, she adds: “We're afraid of running out of supplies when the number of ventilated patients grows…all doctors feel uncertainty about this. However, the increase of cases is not accelerating, so maybe—and it is only maybe—we will be able to cope with it. We feel we are preparing to go to war, but have felt like this for the last month.”Colombia's cases and deaths are currently similar to Argentina's, after initiating its lockdown on the same day March 20. Two regions are experiencing considerable clusters of cases, the capital Bogota and the Valle del Cauca region, home to Cali, a city with a population of 2·2 million people. “We think the government-ordered confinement decreed by March 20 has caused the number of cases to grow slowly, allowing the entire health system to gradually adapt and prepare”, says Gustavo Ospina-Tascon, a critical care specialist based at Fundación Valle del Lili Hospital in Cali.Colombia currently has a total capacity of 5320 ICU beds, all with full mechanical ventilation, and a further 3200 beds that can be upgraded to full critical care beds at short notice. “The main problem in Colombia is the high heterogeneity between hospitals and regions”, explains Ospina-Tascon. “Some private hospitals have higher capacity for adaptation and reasonable supplies than public hospitals, which have very limited capacity to respond. However, I believe the Colombian health system is in a better situation than others in South America because the whole population has at least some access to health services.”His major concern is the possibility of running out of personal protective equipment (PPE) as the pandemic increases. “A lot of resources have been mobilised. We have received direct contributions from private enterprises to support the crisis to come”, he says. “But none of us know if it will be enough. We have watched as the health systems of high-income countries, such as Spain, Italy, and even the USA, have been overwhelmed. PPE will always be a key point. Will we have enough in 2 or 3 months?”In the rest of South America, governments are battling to control the pandemic while also facing the economic and social consequences of lockdowns. Paraguay, widely applauded for its early lockdown and low numbers of cases and deaths, faces another huge problem: some two thirds of its working population work informally, and thus cannot access the benefits announced by the government to help tackle the social impact of the pandemic. The population does not want to die of starvation while avoiding COVID-19.And Ecuador is struggling with a large outbreak in its largest city Guayaquil, where public health authorities have been overwhelmed by the number of cases and deaths, with tragic reports of many bodies being collected from homes days after the person's death. Cases have now accelerated beyond 10 000, with over 500 recorded deaths, but both are thought to be considerable underestimates. The Ecuadorian Government said 6700 people died in the Guayas province (home to Guayaquil) in the first 2 weeks of April, far more than the usual 1000 deaths seen during the same period in previous years. There are reports across the country of authorities struggling to enforce the lockdown. As in other countries, there is deep inequality, which means not everybody is able or willing to socially distance and stop going to work.\n",
      "When WHO added Disease X to its R&D Blueprint in 2018, the reality of an unknown pathogen that could cause a serious international epidemic was just beyond the limits of the imagination. 2 years later, at the time of writing this Editorial—the beginning of April, 2020—over 1 million people around the world have been infected with COVID-19 virus and 80 000 people have died from the disease. One-third of the world's population is in lockdown. As the world's most advanced economies struggle to repurpose state and private sector capacity to meet the growing demands on health services, the spotlight is shifting to countries without formal social safety nets or the massive monetary injections needed to bolster their economies.COVID-19 is yet to establish a firm foothold in low-income nations, but African countries are already feeling the economic impact of the stall in global demand for oil, gas, and commodity products. UNDP has estimated income losses of US$220 billion in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. This, combined with the potential health impact, could be catastrophic. A Comment published in The Lancet Global Health in April found that a rapid acceleration in the number of cases in west Africa, as has been seen in Europe, could quickly overwhelm vulnerable health systems that typically have fewer than five hospital beds per 10 000 population. UNDP has called on the international community to pool resources to not only support the public health response but also to prevent economic collapse in the poorest countries. Similarly, the African Development Bank has appealed for a globally coordinated fiscal stimulus. The UN Economic Commission for Africa's Executive Secretary, Vera Songwe, expressed her disappointment at the global response with a reminder that, “If one of us has the virus – all of us have it.”But with many borders closed and wealthy nations increasingly looking inwards, we are reminded of the asymmetrical power structures that still dominate the largely high-income-country concept of global health and development, and the dangers of the poorest countries being left in the dark as traditional powers shift their focus to the overwhelming problems at home. “The global health model is based in large part on technical assistance and capacity building by the US, the UK, and other rich countries, whose response has been sclerotic and delayed at best”, wrote Sarah Dalglish in a letter to The Lancet in March. Criticising the established notion of global health expertise being concentrated in legacy powers and historically rich states, she laments that “relatively little has been heard from African veterans of the Ebola epidemics in west and central Africa”.The scientific community has fervently responded to the call for a treatment for COVID-19, with the first results of Gilead's experimental antiviral, remdesivir, due to be released this month. However, in the rush to register trials—over 300 so far—a sinister undercurrent has re-emerged. At the beginning of April, two French doctors sparked an intense backlash over comments made during a live television discussion about COVID-19 trials in Europe and Australia by saying that the studies should be done in Africa first “where there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation”, reasoning that certain studies on AIDS had been carried out in prostitutes “because we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves”.Africa is a continent where the legacy of colonialism is particularly heavy. It is shocking to hear these remarks from scientists in the 21st century, at a time when the work of epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, public health specialists and, indeed, all health workers, is in the public spotlight like never before. At the WHO press briefing on April 6, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded plainly, “To be honest, I was so appalled, and it was at a time when I said we needed solidarity. These kinds of racist remarks will not help. It goes against solidarity. Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine…The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop.”Territorial colonialism may have ended long ago but this contemporary global health crisis can serve as a reminder that the colonisation of medicine, economics, and of politics, remains alive. We must reflect on practices that have their origins in 19th century imperialism and replace them with new systems that are rooted in values of recognition, reciprocity, and respect.\n",
      "In these times of rapid change, with high levels of uncertainty, anxiety, social isolation, and financial pressure, mental health worldwide is likely to be at risk. Researchers are rightly ensuring that mental health research is included in the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.1Balmer N MQ and AMS convene expert group to rapidly develop a mental health research response to COVID-19.https://www.mqmentalhealth.org/news-blog/post/mq-and-ams-convene-expert-group-to-rapidly-develop-a-mental-health-research-response-to-covid-19Date: March 25, 2020Date accessed: March 31, 2020Google Scholar Here, we reflect on ethical issues to consider when conducting research on self-harm, suicide, and the broader impacts of COVID-19 in the midst of a global pandemic, and provide some recommendations to consider when researching these topics.In non-pandemic times, research suggests that participating in self-harm and suicide studies is unlikely to cause substantial distress, even in the most vulnerable,2Gould MS et al.Evaluating iatrogenic risk of youth suicide screening programs: a randomized controlled trial.JAMA. 2005; 293: 1635-1643Crossref\n",

First, to avoid unnecessary burden on people who might be in distress during the pandemic. Second, because the context of the current research environment means that results will require cautious interpretation. Third, to ensure that continued recruitment of people to studies on self-harm and suicide when a global crisis is occurring is reasonable and safe; transferring face-to-face research online must be very carefully considered. Finally, because the supports and services that participants would be signposted to throughout a study might not able to provide support in the usual ways and formats.Mental health research, including self-harm and suicide, is a vital part of the response to the pandemic, but we are concerned about the ethical robustness of some studies already recruiting. We have seen studies that do not provide sufficient information to enable fully informed consent, do not measure mood before or after participation, do not provide any signposting other than to potentially anxiety-provoking messages about COVID-19, and do not attempt any kind of mood mitigation or debrief to help to stabilise anyone that does become distressed after participation. We would recommend that researchers be mindful that general research into the impacts of COVID-19, even if this does not evaluate mental health, self-harm, or suicide, should be viewed as a highly sensitive topic, with similar attention to safeguards needed to protect the wellbeing of participants.We recommend that all studies into COVID-19, self-harm, and suicide measure mood before and after participation; a simple visual analogue scale has been used to good effect in several studies.4Townsend E Wadman R Sayal K et al.Uncovering key patterns in self-harm in adolescents: sequence analysis using the Card Sort Task for Self-harm (CaTS).J Affect Disord. 2016; 206: 161-168Crossref\n",

This would be strengthened if people with lived experience were among the core leadership team (currently comprised of six senior academics).

Sarah Knowles (University of York) has recently curated materials for researchers to facilitate effective co-creation and patient and public involvement in the digital world.9Digital and remote codesign discussion.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nWKI1G_erwNyI4OuTVQT4vHznx417OPEVDO1ioi7xtA/editDate accessed: March 31, 2020Google ScholarFor all research to be considered ethical, the benefits must be high and the risk minimised. The research community must be very clear about who will benefit from the research, how it can be implemented to inform policy and practice, and in what time frame. Clearly, ethics committees across the globe have a vital role to play in weighing these issues and in the context of a growing plethora of online studies. Given social distancing and lockdowns, an effective digital response is crucial. Clinical mental health services globally are having to mobilise staff digitally and remotely to meet current need. The research community also needs to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we must ensure that what we are doing is ethical.View Large\n",

These services are coordinated by the department of mental health, which provides a full range of psychiatric care, from acute emergency treatment to long-term rehabilitation.Within the ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo department of mental health, our unit serves a population of approximately 350 000 citizens in south Milan. Two inpatient units with a maximum capacity of 29 beds are used for voluntary and compulsory admissions with an estimated length of stay of 12·9 days.3Di Cesare M Di Fiandra T Di Minco L et al.Rapporto salute mentale: analisi dei dati del sistema informativo per la salute mentale (SISM).http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_pubblicazioni_2841_allegato.pdfDate: 2017Date accessed: March 24, 2020Google Scholar These two locked psychiatric wards are in the context of a large university hospital, which includes 18–20 wards of medical and surgical specialties. Over the past 3 weeks, most wards have been converted to COVID-19 intensive and subintensive care units with a joint effort of pneumologists, infectious disease specialists, internists, anaesthesiologists, and a growing number of other specialists.On March 8, 2020, the regional authority for welfare ordered a block on all but urgent outpatient services (eg, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or dialysis), and to maintain full functionality of mental health and substance misuse services. This choice has several implications for mental health workers. First of all, inpatient and outpatient mental health services are recognised by authorities as fundamental services to the community during a global pandemic. Second, given the delay of shared guidelines, individual departments have been challenged to develop an emergency plan within hours.In this context, we developed the following recommendations, agreed by the hospital management. First, we recommend closure of second-level and third-level outpatient units (eg, perinatal depression, eating disorders, psychiatry for older people, adult neuropsychiatry, adult autism); for these patients, staff have been doing phone calls and video conference-based visits only for emergencies or specific patient requests. Second, general psychiatry outpatient services should be restricted to urgent visits and patients who require daily administration of medicines or long-acting injectables; on a case-by-case individual revision, physicians are required to re-assess the need for patients to access the service daily and medication assignment on a biweekly or weekly basis is strongly encouraged; visits are limited to those identified as urgent by the patient or physician and frequent, brief telephone updates are encouraged. Third, mental health-care staff (including social workers, rehabilitation technicians, and nurses) are encouraged to actively revise patient charts to identify those with severe mental disorders who are considered to be at increased risk for severe outcomes of COVID-19 (including those with comorbid hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary heart disease).4Guan W Ni Z Yu Hu et al.Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (Published online Feb 28.)DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2002032Crossref\n",
      "Google Scholar These patients should be called via telephone to verify full understanding of the government lockdown procedures and instructed on basic hygiene norms. For those who live with older parents, a clear revision of requirements should be proposed at a time of welfare service restrictions and decreased availability of basic needs such as food. Fourth, patients should be advised to only access the emergency room of the hospital after having discussed alternative possibilities with staff from the outpatient service to follow the lockdown procedure and limit chances of infection.Within the wards, we make the following seven recommendations: (1) restrict the number of co-working mental health-care staff to preserve material and human resources if needed during the course of the epidemic in other medical wards; (2) provide continuous training of hospitalised patients who have acute symptoms on hygiene norms and social distancing in particular (such patients might have generally disorganised behaviour and frequent repetition of norms should be considered to minimise the risk of infection); (3) be continuously and actively vigilant for suspected COVID-19 symptoms to minimise the risk of outbreak within the ward; (4) continuously revise the mechanism of patient discharge to minimise the risk of contact with newly admitted patients, for all those who can be safely readmitted home; (5) suspend all group activities, including the use of common dining rooms, which should be restricted to those patients who require direct observation during meals (if unavoidable, the minimal recommended distances of 1–2 m should be preserved between patients); (6) develop and review isolation procedures within the ward, based on local architectural and functional conditions, in the likelihood of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 with acute severe mental health conditions that cannot be treated outside the psychiatric ward; and (7) on the basis of local availability, online videoconferencing should be implemented for all staff meeting activities (this should also be considered for patient visits and communication with relatives, whose access to the ward should be greatly restricted.Finally, psychiatric emergency room activity should be carefully integrated in the revised activity of the hospital. Although the risk of contact with individuals with COVID-19 might increase slightly in this setting as the number of cases who access the emergency room surges, it seems safer to screen for COVID-19 symptoms adequately in the context of the general emergency room before access to the psychiatric ward.In conclusion, several rapid modifications must be implemented in the context of a department of mental health during a pandemic to protect patients with severe mental disorders and staff. Optimisation of shared procedures is mandatory to also limit the potential lack of adherence of some patients with national lockdown indications. The feasibility and effectiveness of online mental health services has been suggested by colleagues who faced the COVID-19 outbreak in China.5Liu S Yang L Zhang C et al.Online mental health services in China during the COVID-19 outbreak.Lancet Psychiatry. 2020;  (published online Feb 18.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30077-8Summary\n",

      "The tragic events in Italy, with more than 10 000 deaths due to novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), are causing pain and demoralisation to a still incredulous and shocked general population. It is particularly distressing that outbreaks of infection have developed rapidly in many nursing homes, where staff have been completely neglected by health authorities and can offer only little protection to many frail and needy older people.In the province of Bergamo, more than 600 nursing home residents, from a total capacity of 6400 beds, died between March 7 and 27, 2020. A similar hecatomb is occurring in many other parts of the administrative regions of Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna, where nursing homes commonly have 10–15 deaths due to COVID-19 out of 70 guests. In some cases, 3–4 guests died in a single day.In the past decade, especially in the north of Italy, residences for older people had reached a good standard of quality, similar to the European average.1Panella M Di Dio A Rubino A et al.Evaluating quality and safety in long term care: results from the experimentation of the Smart Star model.Ig Sanita Pubbl. 2018; 74 (in Italian).: 455-474Google Scholar However, the system was seemingly operating at the limit of economic survival, with no provision for an emergency. At the first crisis, the system thus met with serious difficulties. Today is time only to reduce the suffering of the present; at the end of the drama, planning the functioning of nursing homes in a different way must be essential.In our view, during the COVID-19 epidemic, nursing homes of northern Italy are like isolated citadels, with very little contact with the external environment. Loneliness, therefore, is the general condition in these nursing homes, where nobody enters and nobody exits. The prevailing feeling is that of living in a trap, in a generally modern residence, where everything happens in the most complete closure, to defend those who are inside from the risk of contagion and those who are outside from the possibility of witnessing the progressive, unavoidable, and unmodifiable shutdown of many lives.The situation is characterised by various dynamics. Residents struggle with the absence of relatives and their visits. An attempt has been made to replace direct contacts with the use of tablet computers. However, this provision has limited effectiveness on residents with dementia, who need a caress, a massage, and a nearby voice. In many cases, this attempt has caused serious discomfort, which manifests itself as delirium superimposed on dementia, in particular a hypokinetic type, with the consequent refusal of food and the difficulty of getting out of bed.2Morandi A Lucchi E Turco R et al.Delirium superimposed on dementia: a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of patient experience.J Psychosom Res. 2015; 79: 281-287Crossref\n",

      "Google Scholar Older residents who are cognitively intact also breathe the atmosphere of anxiety and anguish, even if staff try not to convey their worries and fears.Relatives struggle with the breakdown of direct relationships with their loved ones. In some, serious feelings of guilt develop. One relative told us, “if I had not put my dad in the nursing home, he would still be with me and in these dramatic moments I could make him understand all my affection”. In others, aggression towards nursing home managers arises. All are dominated by fear and anguish because the messages filtered by the staff regarding the condition of their loved ones do not eliminate anxieties for the future. This feeling is aggravated by television and newspaper reports that residents cannot be transferred to emergency hospital facilities because these are too overcrowded. Family members feel like they are left outside the walls of a castle, without knowing anything about what is going on inside.Doctors working in nursing homes feel responsible (even if the blame lies with government administrations) for not having isolated residents in a timely manner, meaning that many residents transmitted the virus to their relatives. Doctors feel powerless and completely disoriented. They have seen their colleagues become infected and die despite protections and cautions. Doctors feel exhausted and unable to make good clinical predictions: some patients seem to be seriously ill and recover, whereas others appear to be fine then die. Swab tests are only done in hospitals, when patients are symptomatic.The staff fear for their own families, particularly for the older people and children with whom they live at home. Moreover, every time a resident dies, a bond that has been built in months of closeness gets broken; this loss causes a pain that most of the time cannot be shared with anyone because the numbers of staff on duty have decreased because of contamination with the virus. Psychological support services for staff have been abolished during the epidemic. In some cases, staff have been provided accommodation that is separate from those of their families, which creates an additional castle effect, provoking, in turn, complex dynamics between care team members, who frequently lack effective leadership.The managers of nursing homes feel guilty about the absence of preparation; there is a shortage of oxygen, ventilators, masks, and eyeglasses. The risk of managers soon crossing from anxiety and anguish to loss of energy and renunciation, without producing any positive reactions, must be monitored.Despite the critical situation, operators and guests do not exhibit manifest signs of aggression, and episodes of verbal or physical violence are seldom recorded. Unexpectedly, an atmosphere of particular sweetness has often been observed, as if people transformed their anxiety into extraordinary acts of closeness and kindness. Guests should continue to see light at the end of the tunnel, and for health professionals, death should not turn off the light in their eyes; instead, they should continue to provide hope to residents.The feeling of living in a besieged castle is reinforced by the fact that the residents who die do not receive a public funeral, with no involvement of relatives and local communities; therefore, no evidence exists of a relationship between inside and outside. This lack of connectivity is unprecedented. Dead people disappear without any contact with those who previously knew them and loved them. Because there is no more room in the local cemeteries and no cremation can be done nearby, military trucks have transported the coffins of dead people to other regions. Television pictures of these scenes have made a huge impression on all Italian citizens. From the besieged castles desperate appeals for help frequently emerge.

      "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is raising levels of anxiety worldwide: both appropriate anxiety in reaction to real dangers and maladaptive panic. Beyond handwashing, a key public health directive is social distancing, which entails avoiding public gatherings and generally keeping physical distance from others. The economy is shutting down, leaving people at home without the structure of their daily work routine. The closing of theatres, museums, restaurants, and bars has disrupted and diminished social life. Rapid shifts in information (and misinformation) about a previously unknown pathogen amplify ongoing uncertainty and anxiety. Social distancing seems to mean increasing social isolation while worrying about a potentially lethal illness. Isolation can easily translate to loss of social support, particularly for individuals who live alone; and loss of social support often compounds symptom severity.The current crisis is transforming both our society and our practice. This situation has large implications for psychotherapy, and perhaps particularly for interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT).1Weissman MM Markowitz JC Klerman GL The guide to interpersonal psychotherapy.

In IPT, we generally aspire to have patients look up from their screens to make eye contact, but now we distance. Now talking heads might be the safest substitute for personal encounters.Whereas other treatments like psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy have intrapsychic targets, IPT focuses on the interpersonal arena. IPT therapists usually encourage patients to interact with others. Social contact is already a challenge for depressed and anxious patients, and it has just become far more complicated. It is not a good time to join a social group or meet new individuals. So how should therapists handle the current crisis? Recent virtual supervisions and treatments have offered the following suggestions.Address reality. The first step is to acknowledge the extraordinary situation. To strengthen the therapeutic alliance, therapists can be clear that we would rather meet in person, but that in this public health emergency that is not a good idea. The therapist might want to privately recognise his or her countertransference, which might well include relief at avoiding infection by maintaining a distance. The message to the patient, however, needs to convey that the therapist will stay in touch and continue working to help the patient get better, the crisis notwithstanding. Indeed, isolated patients need a lifeline now more than ever. Try to maintain a regular schedule, and have the patient find a space where he or she will not be overheard or interrupted. It is important to try to use Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved media to make eye contact through the screen. Give the patient your full empathic attention; do not take notes during sessions. The therapeutic alliance could have particular potency in a time of crisis.Social support. Similarly, the patient's social interaction presents a dilemma. It is important to make the most of social engagement given the limitations of the moment, to maintain social bonds, and to seek interpersonal support even as one must maintain a safe physical distance. Social engagement—attachment—is a basic human need.5Bowlby J Attachment and loss, vol 1. Attachment. Basic Books,\n",

      "        New York2018Google Scholar can identify existing relationships that the patient can use to minimise isolation. The phone, FaceTime, Skype, and the like can help to lessen social isolation and maintain social support. Failing that strategy, more isolated individuals might want to use social media to maintain a sense of connection with others.Because most new therapies require in-person intake visits, a patient you terminate with is unlikely to be able to start new treatment elsewhere. Hence, even if you were planning to terminate a time-limited treatment with a patient, it might be appropriate—depending upon clinical status—to add continuation sessions to a treatment you would normally end, in order to ensure the patient's continuity of care.Every cloud has a silver lining. Objectively, this situation is a terrible moment in world history, and not one to trivialise to patients. From a therapeutic stance, however, bad news can be good news. IPT therapists capitalise on environmental stressors and losses—the death of a significant other (complicated bereavement), a painful interpersonal situation (role dispute), or other major life event (role transition)—as helpful explanations for why patients are feeling the way they do, contextualising those feelings and symptoms in a current personal crisis that the patient can work on and resolve in time-limited treatment.1Weissman MM Markowitz JC Klerman GL The guide to interpersonal psychotherapy.

      "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11, and the disease is now expected to spread to most countries, if not all.1WHOWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19.https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020Date: March 11, 2020Date accessed: March 12, 2020Google Scholar The public health messaging mainly concerns personal hygiene, physical distancing, respiratory etiquette, stocking up on food supplies and essential medicines, contact tracing, and staying indoors as much as possible. We are concerned that the current public health messaging might be leaving out an important at-risk population: people who use drugs, including beverage and non-beverage alcohol, and in particular, individuals who are marginalised and street entrenched. Marginalised people who use drugs might be at an increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and of poor outcomes of COVID-19, because of limited personal resources, unstable and densely populated housing conditions, substance use sharing practices, and compromised immunity (eg, in individuals living with HIV, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other comorbidities). Other concerns pertain to limited access to essential medicines (including opioid agonist treatments) and harm reduction supplies.Investments in harm reduction supplies and services need to be expanded now. These investments should focus on increasing supplies for safer smoking, snorting, and injecting drug use, access to alternatives to non-beverage alcohol, and providing sanitising supplies and educational materials in harm reduction packages. Harm reduction services should prepare for logistical challenges by developing emergency plans for potential volunteer and employee absences, illness, and burnout as well as communication plans in case of service disruption in essential services (eg, access to prescribed medications, safe consumption rooms, and overdose prevention sites). Treatment continuity plans (eg, permitting online visits, phone-based refills, extended prescriptions, permitting take-home doses, permitting prescriptions to be transferred between pharmacies, and providing ongoing access through outreach and delivery options) are needed for individuals living with HIV, hepatitis C virus, and substance use disorders. Because emergency services are likely to be overburdened, responses to overdoses or other medical emergencies related to substance use (eg, severe alcohol withdrawal) might be delayed; efforts should be made to ensure access to appropriate clinical sites and specialist care, as well as a high penetration and uninterrupted supply of naloxone kits. In settings such as those in North America, where there is an influx of fentanyl and its analogues,2Karamouzian M Papamihali K Graham B et al.Known fentanyl use among clients of harm reduction sites in British Columbia, Canada.Int J Drug Policy. 2020; 77102665Crossref\n",

      "The COVID-19 crisis will touch the life of everyone in some way. While viral transmission, incubation times, and care of severely affected patients rightly dominate the news, it is heartening that mental health is given plenty of airtime. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are to be expected in times of stress. Concerns more specific to the COVID-19 outbreak that might have more lasting consequences are the features that prevent health-care staff, carers, and families from having personal contact with patients: working from behind a mask, limiting physical interaction, and not being able to visit ill relatives. Bereavement will be particularly painful without the chance to say goodbye. Children seem to be least affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2, but might experience adverse effects from missing school and being confined indoors.The National Health Commission of China acknowledged these burdens in January, when it published a list of basic principles for emergency psychological crisis interventions. This list was informed by the experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak, and recommended that mental health care should be provided for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, health-care professionals caring for them, close contacts, suspected cases who are isolated at home, and families and friends of affected people. Doctors highlighted various other groups at risk of mental distress, such as older people, or pregnant women, but it soon became clear that risk pertained to everyone.What about people already living with mental health disorders, who are all especially vulnerable in times of crisis, but in different ways? Crucial mental health services are generally being protected from closure and reassignment of staff to treat patients with COVID-19—eg, in Lombardy, Italy, the regional authority specified that mental health and substance misuse services should maintain full functionality. The reassessment of services recommended by Armando D'Agostino and colleagues for their hospital in Milan illustrates practical ways to optimise use of resources, such as closure of certain specialist outpatient units, use of technology for remote consultations, encouraging longer-term prescriptions, and identifying patients with comorbidities that put them at risk from infection with SARS-CoV-2 and contacting them to ensure they understand how to adhere to social isolation requirements.From perspective, many who would not have previously considered their mental health as part of their identity now find that they have common experiences with those living with mental illness and confined to home by social anxiety, OCD, or agoraphobia. Many of the adjustments to working life echo calls made for years by disability activists. In the UK, recent legal changes reflect this possible reduction in otherness experienced by those living with mental illness, with the Coronavirus Act 2020 assigning police powers of detention and compulsory assessment over people they suspect of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Full parity between mental and physical illness is not achieved, because the Coronavirus Act does not extend to compulsory treatment, but the Act might prompt some to reflect on the implications of involuntary treatment for mental health disorders.Like many things in these days of change, psychotherapy services are moving online far faster than anyone could have envisaged only weeks ago. While it might work for established patients, the application of telemedicine to new patients is a less certain prospect. Remote sessions are also easier for some types of psychotherapy than for others. John Markowitz describes the challenges for interpersonal psychotherapy and guidance on how to overcome these. It would be good to embed research projects around such new ways of working, to assess feasibility, efficacy, and above all acceptability. Are they a temporary means to an end or the sign of things to come?In times of crisis, research might seem a low priority, but as with all crises, it is essential that we monitor innovations and collect high-quality data so that, at a later date, we can learn what worked and what did not. Such research must be done, as far as possible, according to normal standards and complying with ethical best practice. It is also important that the invaluable resources of longitudinal cohort studies around the world are maintained as much as possible, because they will be essential when we have time to examine the long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for our mental health. Our world of social isolation has never been so inclusive: once the pandemic has passed, may the benefits endure and the disadvantages fade away.For the National Health Commission of China announcement (in Chinese) see www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202001/6adc08b966594253b2b791be5c3b9467.shtmlFor the National Health Commission of China announcement (in Chinese) see www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202001/6adc08b966594253b2b791be5c3b9467.shtmlView Large\n",

      "BackgroundIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.MethodsWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.FindingsUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.InterpretationThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.FundingUK Medical Research Council.In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.

In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.UK Medical Research Council.As of March 25, 2020, 414 179 cases and 18 440 deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had been reported worldwide.1WHOCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report—43.https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200303-sitrep-43-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=2c21c09c_2Date: March 3, 2020Date accessed: March 5, 2020Google Scholar The epidemic began in mainland China, with a geographical focus in the city of Wuhan, Hubei.

Several studies have estimated the case fatality ratio (the percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed disease who die from the disease) and infection fatality ratio (the percentage of all infected individuals who die from the disease, including those with mild disease) of COVID-19 using a range of different statistical and modelling methods. Studies done solely in hospitalised patients report the highest fatality ratios (8–28%), representing the outcome for the most severely ill patients. Estimates of the population-level case fatality ratio from all case reports are in the range of 2–8%. Estimates of the infection fatality ratio averaged across all age-groups range from 0·2% to 1·6%, while estimates of the infection fatality ratio in the oldest age group (≥80 years) range from 8% to 36%. None of the identified studies had adjusted for differences in the denominator populations to obtain estimates that could be applied across populations. No other studies have estimated the proportion of infected individuals who will require hospitalisation.Added value of this studyBy synthesising data from across a range of surveillance settings, we obtained estimates of the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio that take into account the different denominator populations in the datasets. Our underlying assumption, that attack rates (ie, the probability of becoming infected) do not vary substantially by age, is consistent with previous studies for respiratory infections. Under this assumption, differences in age patterns among cases in Wuhan versus those elsewhere in China would probably due to under-ascertainment of cases, given the different surveillance systems in place. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis, with cases in Wuhan seen in older individuals, who would have been identified through attendance at hospital, whereas cases elsewhere in China being younger overall, which would be explained by the policy of testing those with a travel history to Wuhan. After correcting for these biases, we found that estimates of the case fatality ratio from China are consistent with those obtained from early international cases. Our age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio can be applied to any demography to give an estimate of the infection fatality ratio in older and younger populations. These estimates can be combined with estimates of the infection attack rate (approximately 80% for an unmitigated epidemic) to give rough projections of scale.

With the rapid geographical spread observed to date, COVID-19 therefore represents a major global health threat in the coming weeks and months. Our estimate of the proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation, when combined with likely infection attack rates (around 50–80%), show that even the most advanced health-care systems are likely to be overwhelmed.

We also removed eight cases with onset before Jan 1, 2020, or death before Jan 21, 2020, and three deaths after Jan 28, 2020, which were the dates consistent with reliable reporting of onset and death in this setting, respectively, considering the onset-to-death times (including early onsets creates a bias towards long onset-to-death times, reflecting under-ascertainment of deaths early on).

Therefore, we re-parameterised a gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 0·14 per day, obtained from the early case onset data (appendix p 6). Using Bayesian methods, we fitted gamma distributions to the data on time from onset to death and onset to recovery, conditional on having observed the final outcome. Missing onset dates were imputed on the basis of dates of report, where available.Estimates of the distribution of times from onset-to-death were used to project the expected cumulative number of deaths given the onsets observed in Wuhan and outside Wuhan, assuming a uniform attack rate across age groups. Using the age-distribution of the population, we obtained an estimate of the expected number of infections in each age group. Under-ascertainment was estimated in and outside of Wuhan by comparing the number of observed cases by age to this expected distribution, assuming perfect ascertainment in the 50–59 age group as this group had the highest number of detected cases relative to population size. We also did a sensitivity analysis assuming a differential attack rate by age (appendix p 9). For Wuhan, we added scaling to account for further under-ascertainment compared with outside of Wuhan. These steps gave us the expected age-distribution of cases.For a given onset-to-death distribution, we obtained a modelled estimate of the cumulative number of deaths by age under an age-dependent case fatality ratio (fitted relative to the case fatality ratio in the oldest age group, which represented the highest crude case fatality ratio). This estimate was compared with the observed deaths by age using a Poisson likelihood. These data were then jointly fitted alongside the most recent age-aggregated cumulative deaths and cases in mainland China. Given that the numbers of observed cases and deaths have dropped substantially following a peak in late January, the ratio of current cumulative cases to current number of deaths, once corrected for under-ascertainment, should provide a good estimate of the final case fatality ratio.11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Crossref\n",

Full mathematical details are provided in the appendix (p 8).Assuming a uniform attack rate by age groups, we used the demography-adjusted under-ascertainment rates calculated above to obtain an estimate of the proportion of infected individuals who would require hospitalisation.To independently validate our infection fatality ratio estimate, we analysed data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise liner taking the dates of reported positive tests as a proxy for onset date. We calculated the expected proportion of deaths observed until March 25, 2020, given the onset times and estimated onset-to-death distribution (appendix p 13).We used parametric and non-parametric methods11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Crossref\n",

Cases in which the outcome was unknown were treated as censored observations. For parametric and non-parametric analyses, missing onset dates were multiply imputed using information on the onset-to-report distribution, and unreported recoveries were imputed using onset-to-outcome distributions and country summary data. The parametric models were fitted to the data using Bayesian methods (appendix p 12).The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.In the subset of 24 deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in mainland China early in the epidemic, with correction for bias introduced by the growth of the epidemic, we estimated the mean time from onset to death to be 18·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 15·7–49·7; figure 2) with a coefficient of variation of 0·45 (95% CrI 0·29–0·54). With the small number of observations in these data and given that they were from early in the epidemic, we could not rule out many deaths occurring with longer times from onset to death, hence the high upper limit of the credible interval. However, given that the epidemic in China has since declined, our posterior estimate of the mean time from onset to death, informed by the analysis of aggregated data from China, is more precise (mean 17·8 days [16·9–19·2]; figure 2).Figure 2Onset-to-death and onset-to-recovery distributionsShow full caption(A) Onset-to-death data from 24 cases in mainland China early in the epidemic.

A large proportion of the cases, including all of those early in the epidemic, were reported in Wuhan, where the local health system was quickly overwhelmed. As a result, the age distribution of cases reported in Wuhan differed to that in the rest of China (figure 3A). Reported cases in Wuhan were more frequent in older age groups, perhaps reflecting higher severity (and therefore prioritisation for hospitalisation in Wuhan), while cases outside of Wuhan might also show a bias in terms of the relationship between age and travel. Adjusting for differences in underlying demography and assuming no overall difference in the attack rate by age, we estimated high under-ascertainment of cases in younger age groups both inside and outside of Wuhan (figure 3C, D). Furthermore, we estimated a higher level of under-ascertainment overall in Wuhan compared with outside of Wuhan (figure 3C). Accounting for this under-ascertainment, we estimated the highest case fatality ratio (13·4% [11·2–15·9%]) in the 80 years and older age group (figure 3B, table 1), with lower case fatality ratios associated with lower age groups, and the lowest in the 0–9 years age group (0·00260% [0·000312–0·0382]).Table 1Estimates of case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio obtained from aggregate time series of cases in mainland ChinaDeathsLaboratory-confirmed cases** Values do not include the clinically diagnosed cases included in our estimates.Case fatality ratioInfection fatality ratio†† Obtained by combining estimates of case fatality ratios with information on infection prevalence obtained from those returning home on repatriation flights.CrudeAdjusted for censoringAdjusted for censoring, demography, and under-ascertainment‡‡ Accounts for the underlying demography in Wuhan and elsewhere in China and corrects for under-ascertainment.Overall102344 6722·29% (2·15–2·43)3·67% (3·56–3·80)1·38% (1·23–1·53)0·657% (0·389–1·33)Age group, years0–904160·000% (0·000–0·883)0·0954% (0·0110–1·34)0·00260% (0·000312–0·0382)0·00161% (0·000185–0·0249)10–1915490·182% (0·00461–1·01)0·352% (0·0663–1·74)0·0148% (0·00288–0·0759)0·00695% (0·00149–0·0502)20–29736190·193% (0·0778–0·398)0·296% (0·158–0·662)0·0600% (0·0317–0·132)0·0309% (0·0138–0·0923)30–391876000·237% (0·140–0·374)0·348% (0·241–0·577)0·146% (0·103–0·255)0·0844% (0·0408–0·185)40–493885710·443% (0·314–0·608)0·711% (0·521–0·966)0·295% (0·221–0·422)0·161% (0·0764–0·323)50–5913010 0081·30% (1·09–1·54)2·06% (1·74–2·43)1·25% (1·03–1·55)0·595% (0·344–1·28)60–6930985833·60% (3·22–4·02)5·79% (5·20–6·34)3·99% (3·41–4·55)1·93% (1·11–3·89)70–7931239187·96% (7·13–8·86)12·7% (11·5–13·9)8·61% (7·48–9·99)4·28% (2·45–8·44)≥80208140814·8% (13·0–16·7)23·3% (20·3–26·7)13·4% (11·2–15·9)7·80% (3·80–13·3)Age category (binary), years<6019430 7630·631% (0·545–0·726)1·01% (0·900–1·17)0·318% (0·274–0·378)0·145% (0·0883–0·317)≥6082913 9095·96% (5·57–6·37)9·49% (9·11–9·95)6·38% (5·70–7·17)3·28% (1·82–6·18)Crude case fatality ratios are presented as mean (95% confidence interval).

Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we estimate an infection fatality ratio of 0·66% (95% CrI 0·39–1·33). As for the case fatality ratio, this is strongly age-dependent, with estimates rising steeply from age 50 years upwards (table 1).

      "Google Scholar Our estimate of an infection fatality ratio of 0·66% in China was informed by PCR testing of international Wuhan residents returning on repatriation flights. This value was consistent with the infection fatality ratio observed in passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship up to March 5, 2020, although it is slightly above the upper 95% confidence limit of the age-adjusted infection fatality ratio observed by March 25 (of 712 confirmed cases, 601 have been discharged, ten have died, and 11 remain in a critical condition). This difference might be due to repatriation flight data slightly underestimating milder infections, or due to cruise passengers having better outcomes because of a potentially higher-than-average quality of health care.Our estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases require hospitalisation. This assumption is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in China, where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation. Mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations, given that the risks associated with COVID-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying comorbidities.Our estimate of the case fatality ratio is substantially lower than the crude case fatality ratio obtained from China based on the cases and deaths observed to date, which is currently 3·67%, as well as many of the estimates currently in the literature. The principle reason for this difference is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases. For example, various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms (for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history)13Jung S Akhmetzhanov AR Hayashi K et al.Real-time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: inference using exported cases.J Clin Med. 2020; 9: E523Crossref\n",

Our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20 years. As there are very few cases in this age group, it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility, although early results indicate young people are not at lower risk of infection than adults.28Bi Q Wu Y Mei S et al.Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 19.) (preprint).DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423Google Scholar Serological testing in this age group will be crucial in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age group in driving population transmission. The estimated increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case reports, in which the mean age tends to be in the range of 50–60 years. Different surveillance systems will pick up a different age case mix, and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through a history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance. Our correction for this surveillance bias therefore allows us to obtain estimates that can be applied to different case mixes and demographic population structures. However, it should be noted that this correction is applicable under the assumption of a uniform infection attack rate (ie, exposure) across the population. We also assumed perfect case ascertainment outside of Wuhan in the age group with the most cases relative to their population size (50–59-year-olds); however, if many cases were missed, the case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio estimates might be lower. In the absence of random population surveys of infection prevalence, our adjustment from case fatality ratio to infection fatality ratio relied on repatriation flight data, which was not age specific. The reported proportion of infected individuals who were asymptomatic on the Diamond Princess did not vary considerably by age, supporting this approach, but future larger representative population prevalence surveys and seroprevalence surveys will inform such estimates further.Much of the data informing global estimates of the case fatality ratio at present are from the early outbreak in Wuhan. Given that the health system in this city was quickly overwhelmed, our estimates suggest that there is substantial under-ascertainment of cases in the younger age groups (who we estimate to have milder disease) by comparison with elsewhere in mainland China. This under-ascertainment is the main factor driving the difference between our estimate of the crude case fatality ratio from China (3·67%) and our best estimate of the overall case fatality ratio (1·38%). The case fatality ratio is likely to be strongly influenced by the availability of health-care facilities. However surprisingly, although health-care availability in Wuhan was stretched, our estimates from international cases are of a similar magnitude, suggesting relatively little difference in health outcome. Finally, as clinical knowledge of this new disease accrues, it is possible that outcomes will improve. It will therefore be important to revise these estimates as epidemics unfold.The world is currently experiencing the early stages of a global pandemic. Although China has succeeded in containing the disease spread for 2 months, such containment is unlikely to be achievable in most countries. Thus, much of the world will experience very large community epidemics of COVID-19 over the coming weeks and months. Our estimates of the underlying infection fatality ratio of this virus will inform assessments of health effects likely to be experienced in different countries, and thus decisions around appropriate mitigation policies to be adopted.This online publication has been corrected.

There is an urgent need for effective treatment. Current focus has been on the development of novel therapeutics, including antivirals and vaccines. Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome. We recommend identification and treatment of hyperinflammation using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality.Current management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality.2Ruan Q Yang K Wang W Jiang L Song J Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China.Intensive Care Med. 2020;  (published online March 3.)DOI:10.1007/s00134-020-05991-xGoogle Scholar Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is an under-recognised, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure.

      "BackgroundSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.MethodsIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.Findings191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.InterpretationThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.

To our knowledge, no previous studies have been done among patients with definite outcomes. The estimation of risk factors for severe disease and death in these earlier case series are therefore not very robust. Additionally, details of the clinical and virological course of illness have not yet been well described.Here, we present details of all patients admitted to the two designated hospitals in Wuhan—Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital—with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and a definite clinical outcome (death or discharge) as of Jan 31, 2020. We aim to explore risk factors of in-hospital death for patients and describe the clinical course of symptoms, viral shedding, and temporal changes of laboratory findings during hospitalisation.Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on Feb 23, 2020, for articles that documented the risk factors of mortality and viral shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the search terms (“novel coronavirus” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “COVID-19”) AND (“death” OR “mortality” OR “viral shedding”) with no language or time restrictions. Age, comorbidities, lymphocytopenia and elevated alanine aminotransferase, d-dimer, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, prothrombin time, and disease severity were reported to be associated with intensive care unit admission. However, no published works were found about the risk factors of mortality for adult patients with COVID-19. One study compared the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat and nasopharyngeal swab in 17 patients with COVID-19.Added value of this studyIn this retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients in two hospitals in Wuhan, China, we found increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer levels greater than 1·0 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.

Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.This retrospective cohort study included two cohorts of adult inpatients (≥18 years old) from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China). All adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were screened, and those who died or were discharged between Dec 29, 2019 (ie, when the first patients were admitted), and Jan 31, 2020, were included in our study. Since these two hospitals were the only designated hospitals for transfer of patients with COVID-19 from other hospitals in Wuhan until Feb 1, 2020, our study enrolled all adult inpatients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and had a definite outcome (dead or discharged) at the early stage of the outbreak.Before Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results were not available in the electronic medical records, from which data for this study were obtained retrospectively; therefore, this study includes 29 of the 41 patients originally reported on.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google ScholarThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of Jinyintan Hospital (KY-2020–01.01) and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission as described previously.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google ScholarEpidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardised data collection form, which was a modified version of the WHO/International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case record form for severe acute respiratory infections. All data were checked by two physicians (FZ and ZL) and a third researcher (GF) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers.Methods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described elsewhere.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Briefly, four institutions—the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences—were responsible for SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. From Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health institutions, and Jingyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Throat-swab specimens were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 PCR re-examination every other day after clinical remission of symptoms, including fever, cough, and dyspnoea, but only qualitative data were available. The criteria for discharge were absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs in chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained at least 24 h apart.Routine blood examinations were complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), myocardial enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin, and procalcitonin. Chest radiographs or CT scan were also done for all inpatients. Frequency of examinations was determined by the treating physician.Fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37·3°C. Sepsis and septic shock were defined according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Secondary infection was diagnosed when patients showed clinical symptoms or signs of pneumonia or bacteraemia and a positive culture of a new pathogen was obtained from lower respiratory tract specimens (qualified sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) or blood samples after admission.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Ventilator-associated pneumonia was diagnosed according to the guidelines for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia.8Kalil AC Metersky ML Klompas M et al.Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society.Clin Infect Dis. 2016; 63: e61-e111Google Scholar Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines9Khwaja A KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury.Nephron Clin Pract. 2012; 120: c179-c184Google Scholar and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition.10Ranieri VM Rubenfeld GD Thompson BT et al.Acute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin Definition.JAMA. 2012; 307: 2526-2533Google Scholar Acute cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or if new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar The illness severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0).11National Health Commission of the People's Republic of ChinaChinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0).http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202002/8334a8326dd94d329df351d7da8aefc2/files/b218cfeb1bc54639af227f922bf6b817.pdfDate: Feb 19, 2020Google Scholar Coagulopathy was defined as a 3-second extension of prothrombin time or a 5-second extension of activated partial thromboplastin time. Hypoproteinaemia was defined as blood albumin of less than 25 g/L. Exposure history was defined as exposure to people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the Wuhan seafood market.Continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%), respectively. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, χ2 test, or Fisher's exact test to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Considering the total number of deaths (n=54) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings and clinical constraints. Previous studies have shown blood levels of d-dimer and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to be higher in critically ill or fatal cases, whereas lymphopenia and cardiovascular disease have been less commonly observed in non-critical or surviving patients with SARS-COV-2 infection.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar,  6Wang D Hu B Hu C et al.Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Feb 7.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.1585Google Scholar,  12Yang X Yu Y Xu J et al.Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study.Lancet Respir Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 24)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5Google Scholar Similar risk factors, including older age, have been reported associated with adverse clinical outcomes in adults with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).3Chan JWM Ng CK Chan YH et al.Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).Thorax. 2003; 58: 686-689Google Scholar,  13Arabi YM Balkhy HH Hayden FG et al.Middle East respiratory syndrome.N Engl J Med. 2017; 376: 584-594Google Scholar Some laboratory findings, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, and IL-6, might be unavailable in emergency circumstances. Therefore, we chose lymphocyte count, d-dimer, SOFA score, coronary heart disease, and age as the five variables for our multivariable logistic regression model.We excluded variables from the univariable analysis if their between-group differences were not significant, if their accuracy was unconfirmed (eg, exposure, which was self-reported), if the number of events was too small to calculate odds ratios, and if they had colinearity with the SOFA score.We compared patient characteristics between the two hospitals and used a generalised linear model to adjust for possible differences in patients’ characteristics and treatment between the two study centres.A two-sided α of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software (version 9.4), unless otherwise indicated.The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors (BC and HC) had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.813 adult patients were hospitalised in Jinyintan Hospital or Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital with COVID-19 before Jan 31, 2020. After excluding 613 patients that were still hospitalised or not confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection as of Jan 31, 2020, and nine inpatients without available key information in their medical records, we included 191 inpatients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) in the final analysis. 54 patients died during hospitalisation and 137 were discharged. The median age of the 191 patients was 56·0 years (IQR 46·0–67·0), ranging from 18 years to 87 years, and most patients were male (table 1). Comorbidities were present in nearly half of patients, with hypertension being the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease (table 1). The most common symptoms on admission were fever and cough, followed by sputum production and fatigue (table 1). Lymphocytopenia occurred in 77 (40%) patients. 181 (95%) patients received antibiotics and 41 (21%) received antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir; table 2). Systematic corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin use differed significantly between non-survivors and survivors (table 2). The comparison of characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients from the two hospitals are shown in the appendix (pp 2–4).Table 1Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings of patients on admissionTotal (n=191)Non-survivor (n=54)Survivor (n=137)p valueDemographics and clinical characteristicsAge, years56·0 (46·0–67·0)69·0 (63·0–76·0)52·0 (45·0–58·0)<0·0001Sex......0·15Female72 (38%)16 (30%)56 (41%)..Male119 (62%)38 (70%)81 (59%)..Exposure history73 (38%)14 (26%)59 (43%)0·028Current smoker11 (6%)5 (9%)6 (4%)0·21Comorbidity91 (48%)36 (67%)55 (40%)0·0010Hypertension58 (30%)26 (48%)32 (23%)0·0008Diabetes36 (19%)17 (31%)19 (14%)0·0051Coronary heart disease15 (8%)13 (24%)2 (1%)<0·0001Chronic obstructive lung disease6 (3%)4 (7%)2 (1%)0·047Carcinoma2 (1%)02 (1%)0·37Chronic kidney disease2 (1%)2 (4%)00·024Other22 (12%)11 (20%)11 (8%)0·016Respiratory rate >24 breaths per min56 (29%)34 (63%)22 (16%)<0·0001Pulse ≥125 beats per min2 (1%)2 (4%)00·024Systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg1 (1%)01 (1%)0·53Fever (temperature ≥37·3°C)180 (94%)51 (94%)129 (94%)0·94Cough151 (79%)39 (72%)112 (82%)0·15Sputum44 (23%)14 (26%)30 (22%)0·55Myalgia29 (15%)8 (15%)21 (15%)0·93Fatigue44 (23%)15 (28%)29 (21%)0·33Diarrhoea9 (5%)2 (4%)7 (5%)0·67Nausea or vomiting7 (4%)3 (6%)4 (3%)0·40SOFA score2·0 (1·0–4·0)4·5 (4·0–6·0)1·0 (1·0–2·0)<0·0001qSOFA score1·0 (0·0–1·0)1·0 (1·0–1·0)0·0 (0·0–1·0)<0·0001CURB-65 score0·0 (0·0–2·0)2·0 (1·0–3·0)0·0 (0·0–1·0)<0·00010–1141/188 (75%)16 (30%)125/134 (93%)<0·0001** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.232/188 (17%)23 (43%)9/134 (7%)..3–515/188 (8%)15 (28%)0/134..Disease severity status......<0·0001General72 (38%)072 (53%)..Severe66 (35%)12 (22%)54 (39%)..Critical53 (28%)42 (78%)11 (8%)..Time from illness onset to hospital admission, days11·0 (8·0–14·0)11·0 (8·0–15·0)11·0 (8·0–13·0)0·53Laboratory findingsWhite blood cell count, × 109 per L6·2 (4·5–9·5)9·8 (6·9–13·9)5·2 (4·3–7·7)<0·0001<432 (17%)5 (9%)27 (20%)<0·0001** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.4–10119 (62%)24 (44%)95 (69%)..>1040 (21%)25 (46%)15 (11%)..Lymphocyte count, × 109 per L1·0 (0·6–1·3)0·6 (0·5–0·8)1·1 (0·8–1·5)<0·0001<0·877 (40%)41 (76%)36 (26%)<0·0001Haemoglobin, g/L128·0 (119·0–140·0)126·0 (115·0–138·0)128·0 (120·0–140·0)0·30Anaemia29 (15%)14 (26%)15 (11%)0·0094Platelet count, × 109 per L206·0 (155·0–262·0)165·5 (107·0–229·0)220·0 (168·0–271·0)<0·0001<10013 (7%)11 (20%)2 (1%)<0·0001Albumin, g/L32·3 (29·1–35·8)29·1 (26·5–31·3)33·6 (30·6–36·4)<0·0001ALT, U/L30·0 (17·0–46·0)40·0 (24·0–51·0)27·0 (15·0–40·0)0·0050>4059/189 (31%)26 (48%)33/135 (24%)0·0015Creatinine >133 μmol/L8/186 (4%)5 (9%)3/132 (2%)0·045Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L300·0 (234·0–407·0)521·0 (363·0–669·0)253·5 (219·0–318·0)<0·0001>245123/184 (67%)53 (98%)70/130 (54%)<0·0001Creatine kinase, U/L21·5 (13·0–72·4)39·0 (19·5–151·0)18·0 (12·5–52·1)0·0010>18522/168 (13%)11/52 (21%)11/116 (9%)0·038High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, pg/mL4·1 (2·0–14·1)22·2 (5·6–83·1)3·0 (1·1–5·5)<0·0001>2824/145 (17%)23/50 (46%)1/95 (1%)<0·0001Prothrombin time, s11·6 (10·6–13·0)12·1 (11·2–13·7)11·4 (10·4–12·6)0·0004<16171/182 (94%)47 (87%)124/128 (97%)0·016** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.≥1611/182 (6%)7 (13%)4/128 (3%)..D-dimer, μg/mL0·8 (0·4–3·2)5·2 (1·5–21·1)0·6 (0·3–1·0)<0·0001≤0·555/172 (32%)4 (7%)51/118 (43%)<0·0001** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.>0·5 to ≤145/172 (26%)6 (11%)39/118 (33%)..>172/172 (42%)44 (81%)28/118 (24%)..Serum ferritin, μg/L722·0 (377·2–1435·3)1435·3 (728·9–2000·0)503·2 (264·0–921·5)<0·0001>300102/128 (80%)44/46 (96%)58/82 (71%)0·0008IL-6, pg/mL7·4 (5·3–10·8)11·0 (7·5–14·4)6·3 (5·0–7·9)<0·0001Procalcitonin, ng/mL0·1 (0·1–0·1)0·1 (0·1–0·5)0·1 (0·1–0·1)<0·0001<0·1114/164 (70%)19/51 (37%)95/113 (84%)<0·0001** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.≥0·1 to <0·2530/164 (18%)16/51 (31%)14/113 (12%)..≥0·25 to <0·56/164 (4%)3/51 (6%)3/113 (3%)..≥0·514/164 (9%)13/51 (25%)1/113 (1%)..Imaging featuresConsolidation112 (59%)40 (74%)72 (53%)0·0065Ground-glass opacity136 (71%)44 (81%)92 (67%)0·049Bilateral pulmonary infiltration143 (75%)45 (83%)98 (72%)0·090Data are median (IQR), n (%), or n/N (%). p values were calculated by Mann-Whitney U test, χ2 test, or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.

The median time from illness onset to invasive mechanical ventilation was 14·5 days (12·0–19·0). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in three patients, none of whom survived. Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure, and septic shock (table 2). Half of non-survivors experienced a secondary infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The frequency of complications were higher in non-survivors than survivors (table 2).In univariable analysis, odds of in-hospital death was higher in patients with diabetes or coronary heart disease (table 3).

IL-6=interleukin-6.We included 171 patients with complete data for all variables (53 non-survivors and 118 survivors) in the multivariable logistic regression model. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL at admission were associated with increased odds of death (table 3). When adjusting for study centre, our generalised linear model showed similar results (appendix p 5).For survivors, the median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) from illness onset, but the virus was continuously detectable until death in non-survivors (table 2; figure 1). The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. Among 29 patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir and were discharged, the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14·0 days (IQR 10·0–17·0) and the median duration of viral shedding was 22·0 days (18·0–24·0). The median duration of viral shedding was 19·0 days (17·0–22·0) in patients with severe disease status and 24·0 days (22·0–30·0) in patients with critical disease status.Figure 1Clinical courses of major symptoms and outcomes and duration of viral shedding from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19Show full captionFigure shows median duration of symptoms and onset of complications and outcomes.

Baseline lymphocyte count was significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors; in survivors, lymphocyte count was lowest on day 7 after illness onset and improved during hospitalisation, whereas severe lymphopenia was observed until death in non-survivors. Levels of d-dimer, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course, and increased with illness deterioration (figure 2). In non-survivors, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I increased rapidly from day 16 after disease onset, whereas lactate dehydrogenase increased for both survivors and non-survivors in the early stage of illness, but decreased from day 13 for survivors.Figure 2Temporal changes in laboratory markers from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19Show full captionFigure shows temporal changes in d-dimer (A), lymphocytes (B), IL-6 (C), serum ferritin (D), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (E), and lactate dehydrogenase (F).

IL-6=interleukin-6.Median time from illness onset to dyspnoea was similar in survivors and non-survivors, with a median duration of dyspnoea of 13·0 days (9·0–16·5) for survivors (table 2; figure 1). In survivors, the median duration of fever was 12·0 days (8·0–13·0) and cough persisted for 19·0 days (IQR 12·0–23·0; figure 1). 62 (45%) survivors still had cough on discharge and 39 (72%) non-survivors still had cough at the time of death. The dynamic profiles of fever, cough, and dyspnoea are shown in the appendix (p 6). Sepsis developed at a median of 9·0 days (7·0–13·0) after illness onset among all patients, followed by ARDS (12·0 days [8·0–15·0]), acute cardiac injury (15·0 days [10·0–17·0]), acute kidney injury (15·0 days [13·0–19·5]), and secondary infection (17·0 days [13·0–19·0]). The initiation time and duration of systematic corticosteroid use was also similar between the two groups. Among non-survivors, the median time from illness onset was 10·0 days (7·0–14·0) to sepsis, 12·0 days (8·0–15·0) to ARDS, 14·5 days (9·5–17·0) to acute cardiac injury, and 17·0 days (13·0–19·0) to secondary infection (figure 1; table 2). Among survivors, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury were observed in one patient each, occurring 9 days (acute kidney injury), 14 days (secondary infection), and 21 days (acute cardiac injury) after illness onset.The median time from dyspnoea to intubation was 10·0 days (IQR 5·0–12·5) for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation and the time from invasive mechanical ventilation to occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 8·0 days (2·0–9·0; figure 1).This retrospective cohort study identified several risk factors for death in adults in Wuhan who were hospitalised with COVID-19. In particular, older age, d-dimer levels greater than 1 μg/mL, and higher SOFA score on admission were associated with higher odds of in-hospital death. Additionally, elevated levels of blood IL-6, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and lactate dehydrogenase and lymphopenia were more commonly seen in severe COVID-19 illness. Sustained viral detection in throat samples was observed in both survivors and non-survivors.Previously, older age has been reported as an important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS.14Choi KW Chau TN Tsang O et al.Outcomes and prognostic factors in 267 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.Ann Intern Med. 2003; 139: 715-723Google Scholar,  15Hong K-H Choi J-P Hong S-H et al.Predictors of mortality in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).Thorax. 2018; 73: 286-289Google Scholar The current study confirmed that increased age was associated with death in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies in macaques inoculated with SARS-CoV found that older macaques had stronger host innate responses to virus infection than younger adults, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, whereas expression of type I interferon beta was reduced.16Smits SL de Lang A van den Brand JMA et al.Exacerbated innate host response to SARS-CoV in aged non-human primates.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000756-eGoogle Scholar The age-dependent defects in T-cell and B-cell function and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a deficiency in control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses, potentially leading to poor outcome.17Opal SM Girard TD Ely EW The immunopathogenesis of sepsis in elderly patients.Clin Infect Dis. 2005; 41: S504-S512Google ScholarSOFA score is a good diagnostic marker for sepsis and septic shock, and reflects the state and degree of multi-organ dysfunction.18Singer M Deutschman CS Seymour CW et al.The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).JAMA. 2016; 315: 801-810Google Scholar,  19Ferreira FL Bota DP Bross A Mélot C Vincent JL Serial evaluation of the SOFA score to predict outcome in critically ill patients.JAMA. 2001; 286: 1754-1758Google Scholar Although bacterial infections are usually regarded as a leading cause of sepsis, viral infection can also cause sepsis syndrome. Previously, we determined that sepsis occurred in nearly 40% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia due to viral infection.20Zhou F Wang Y Liu Y et al.Disease severity and clinical outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses in adults: a multicentre prospective registry study from the CAP-China Network.Eur Respir J. 2019; 54: 1802406Google Scholar In the current study, we found that more than half of patients developed sepsis. Additionally, we found that more than 70% of patients had white blood cell count below 10·0 × 109 per L or procalcitonin below 0·25 ng/mL, and no bacterial pathogens were detected in these patients on admission. Sepsis was a common complication, which might be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis of sepsis in COVID-19 illness.Cardiac complications, including new or worsening heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction are common in patients with pneumonia. Cardiac arrest occurs in about 3% of inpatients with pneumonia.21Marrie TJ Shariatzadeh MR Community-acquired pneumonia requiring admission to an intensive care unit: a descriptive study.Medicine (Baltimore). 2007; 86: 103-111Google Scholar Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation.22Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Shachkina S Chirinos JA Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system.Lancet. 2013; 381: 496-505Google Scholar Coronary heart disease has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections.22Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Shachkina S Chirinos JA Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system.Lancet. 2013; 381: 496-505Google Scholar,  23Udell JA Zawi R Bhatt DL et al.Association between influenza vaccination and cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients: a meta-analysis.JAMA. 2013; 310: 1711-1720Google Scholar,  24Blackburn R Zhao H Pebody R Hayward A Warren-Gash C Laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections as predictors of hospital admission for myocardial infarction and stroke: time-series analysis of English data for 2004–2015.Clin Infect Dis. 2018; 67: 8-17Google Scholar In this study, increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I during hospitalisation was found in more than half of those who died.

About 90% of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity, marked by increased d-dimer concentrations.25Milbrandt EB Reade MC Lee M et al.Prevalence and significance of coagulation abnormalities in community-acquired pneumonia.Mol Med. 2009; 15: 438-445Google Scholar In this study, we found d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL is associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. High levels of d-dimer have a reported association with 28-day mortality in patients with infection or sepsis identified in the emergency department.26Rodelo JR De la Rosa G Valencia ML et al.D-dimer is a significant prognostic factor in patients with suspected infection and sepsis.Am J Emerg Med. 2012; 30: 1991-1999Google Scholar Contributory mechanisms include systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that are mediators of atherosclerosis directly contributing to plaque rupture through local inflammation, induction of procoagulant factors, and haemodynamic changes, which predispose to ischaemia and thrombosis.27Smeeth L Thomas SL Hall AJ Hubbard R Farrington P Vallance P Risk of myocardial infarction and stroke after acute infection or vaccination.N Engl J Med. 2004; 351: 2611-2618Google Scholar,  28Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Wells GA Chirinos JA Chen L Fine MJ Cardiac complications in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: incidence, timing, risk factors, and association with short-term mortality.Circulation. 2012; 125: 773-781Google Scholar,  29Davidson JA Warren-Gash C Cardiovascular complications of acute respiratory infections: current research and future directions.Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2019; 17: 939-942Google Scholar In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed on myocytes and vascular endothelial cells,30Gallagher PE Ferrario CM Tallant EA Regulation of ACE2 in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts.Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2008; 295: H2373-H2479Google Scholar,  31Mendoza-Torres E Oyarzún A Mondaca-Ruff D et al.ACE2 and vasoactive peptides: novel players in cardiovascular/renal remodeling and hypertension.Ther Adv Cardiovasc Dis. 2015; 9: 217-237Google Scholar so there is at least theoretical potential possibility of direct cardiac involvement by the virus. Of note, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue has been documented in fatal cases of COVID-19, although viral detection studies were not reported.32Xu Z Shi L Wang Y et al.Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.Lancet Respir Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 18)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-XGoogle ScholarThe level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of transmission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. For SARS-CoV, viral RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from about a third of patients as long as 4 weeks after disease onset.33Xu D Zhang Z Jin L et al.Persistent shedding of viable SARS-CoV in urine and stool of SARS patients during the convalescent phase.Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2005; 24: 165-171Google Scholar Similarly, the duration of MERS-CoV RNA detection in lower respiratory specimans persisted for at least 3 weeks,34Corman VM Albarrak AM Omrani AS et al.Viral shedding and antibody response in 37 patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection.Clin Infect Dis. 2016; 62: 477-483Google Scholar,  35Oh MD Park WB Choe PG et al.Viral load kinetics of MERS coronavirus infection.N Engl J Med. 2016; 375: 1303-1405Google Scholar whereas the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection has not been well characterised. In the current study, we found that the detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for a median of 20 days in survivors and that it was sustained until death in non-survivors. This has important implications for both patient isolation decision making and guidance around the length of antiviral treatment. In severe influenza virus infection, prolonged viral shedding was associated with fatal outcome and delayed antiviral treatment was an independent risk factor for prolonged virus detection.36Wang Y Guo Q Yan Z et al.Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding in patients with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection.J Infect Dis. 2018; 217: 1708-1717Google Scholar Similarly, effective antiviral treatment might improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in the current study. Randomised clinical trials for lopinavir/ritonavir (ChiCTR2000029308) and intravenous remdesivir (NCT04257656, NCT04252664) in treatment of COVID-19 are currently in progress.Our study has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective study design, not all laboratory tests were done in all patients, including lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and serum ferritin. Therefore, their role might be underestimated in predicting in-hospital death. Second, patients were sometimes transferred late in their illness to the two included hospitals. Lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high-dose corticosteroid use might have also contributed to the poor clinical outcomes in some patients. Third, the estimated duration of viral shedding is limited by the frequency of respiratory specimen collection, lack of quantitative viral RNA detection, and relatively low positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat-swabs.37Zou L Ruan F Huang M et al.SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMc2001737Google Scholar Fourth, by excluding patients still in hospital as of Jan 31, 2020, and thus relatively more severe disease at an earlier stage, the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of COVID-19. Last but not least, interpretation of our findings might be limited by the sample size. However, by including all adult patients in the two designated hospitals for COVID-19, we believe our study population is representative of cases diagnosed and treated in Wuhan.To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort study among patients with COVID-19 who have experienced a definite outcome. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and elevated d-dimer at admission were risk factors for death of adult patients with COVID-19. The prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for testing novel coronavirus antiviral interventions in efforts to improve outcomes.This online publication has been corrected.

      "In December, 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown cause was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China), and was quickly determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus,1WHOWHO statement regarding cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China.https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-2020-who-statement-regarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-chinaDate: Jan 9, 2020Date accessed: February 11, 2020Google Scholar namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China as well as 27 other countries and regions, with more than 70 000 confirmed cases as of Feb 17, 2020.2WHOCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation reports.https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reportsDate accessed: February 17, 2020Google Scholar In response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed an online interactive dashboard, hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualise and track reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in real time. The dashboard, first shared publicly on Jan 22, illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries for all affected countries. It was developed to provide researchers, public health authorities, and the general public with a user-friendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. All data collected and displayed are made freely available, initially through Google Sheets and now through a GitHub repository, along with the feature layers of the dashboard, which are now included in the Esri Living Atlas.The dashboard reports cases at the province level in China; at the city level in the USA, Australia, and Canada; and at the country level otherwise. During Jan 22–31, all data collection and processing were done manually, and updates were typically done twice a day, morning and night (US Eastern Time). As the outbreak evolved, the manual reporting process became unsustainable; therefore, on Feb 1, we adopted a semi-automated living data stream strategy. Our primary data source is DXY, an online platform run by members of the Chinese medical community, which aggregates local media and government reports to provide cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases in near real time at the province level in China and at the country level otherwise. Every 15 min, the cumulative case counts are updated from DXY for all provinces in China and for other affected countries and regions. For countries and regions outside mainland China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), we found DXY cumulative case counts to frequently lag behind other sources; we therefore manually update these case numbers throughout the day when new cases are identified. To identify new cases, we monitor various Twitter feeds, online news services, and direct communication sent through the dashboard. Before manually updating the dashboard, we confirm the case numbers with regional and local health departments, including the respective centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) of China, Taiwan, and Europe, the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Macau Government, and WHO, as well as city-level and state-level health authorities. For city-level case reports in the USA, Australia, and Canada, which we began reporting on Feb 1, we rely on the US CDC, the government of Canada, the Australian Government Department of Health, and various state or territory health authorities. All manual updates (for countries and regions outside mainland China) are coordinated by a team at Johns Hopkins University.The case data reported on the dashboard aligns with the daily Chinese CDC3Chinese Center for Disease Control and PreventionTracking the epidemic.http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/news/TrackingtheEpidemic.htmDate accessed: February 11, 2020Google Scholar and WHO situation reports2WHOCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation reports.https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reportsDate accessed: February 17, 2020Google Scholar for within and outside of mainland China, respectively (figure). Furthermore, the dashboard is particularly effective at capturing the timing of the first reported case of COVID-19 in new countries or regions (appendix). With the exception of Australia, Hong Kong, and Italy, the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University has reported newly infected countries ahead of WHO, with Hong Kong and Italy reported within hours of the corresponding WHO situation report.FigureComparison of COVID-19 case reporting from different sourcesShow full captionDaily cumulative case numbers (starting Jan 22, 2020) reported by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), WHO situation reports, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) for within (A) and outside (B) mainland China.View Large\n",

      "BackgroundA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.MethodsAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.FindingsBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.InterpretationThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

We hope our study findings will inform the global community of the emergence of this novel coronavirus and its clinical features.Following the pneumonia cases of unknown cause reported in Wuhan and considering the shared history of exposure to Huanan seafood market across the patients, an epidemiological alert was released by the local health authority on Dec 31, 2019, and the market was shut down on Jan 1, 2020. Meanwhile, 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were transferred to a designated hospital starting from Dec 31, 2019. An expert team of physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, and government officials was soon formed after the alert.Since the cause was unknown at the onset of these emerging infections, the diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan was based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia. Suspected patients were isolated using airborne precautions in the designated hospital, Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China), and fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures were taken. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.Local centres for disease control and prevention collected respiratory, blood, and faeces specimens, then shipped them to designated authoritative laboratories to detect the pathogen (NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Mérieux Laboratory, Beijing, China). A novel coronavirus, which was named 2019-nCoV, was isolated then from lower respiratory tract specimen and a diagnostic test for this virus was developed soon after that.14Tan W Zhao X Ma X et al.A novel coronavirus genome identified in a cluster of pneumonia cases — Wuhan, China 2019−2020.http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/a3907201-f64f-4154-a19e-4253b453d10cDate accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Of 59 suspected cases, 41 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. The presence of 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens was detected by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. The primers and probe target to envelope gene of CoV were used and the sequences were as follows: forward primer 5′-ACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTTTCGTGGT-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCAGCAGTACGCACACAATC-3′; and the probe 5′CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3′BHQ1. Conditions for the amplifications were 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s.Initial investigations included a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes). Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, or bronchial aspirates were tested for common viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed.Given the emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases during the influenza season, antibiotics (orally and intravenously) and oseltamivir (orally 75 mg twice daily) were empirically administered. Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 40–120 mg per day) was given as a combined regimen if severe community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed by physicians at the designated hospital. Oxygen support (eg, nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) was administered to patients according to the severity of hypoxaemia. Repeated tests for 2019-nCoV were done in patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection to show viral clearance before hospital discharge or discontinuation of isolation.We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays for all patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection who were reported by the local health authority. The admission data of these patients was from Dec 16, 2019, to Jan 2, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardised data collection forms (modified case record form for severe acute respiratory infection clinical characterisation shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) from electronic medical records. Two researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected. To ascertain the epidemiological and symptom data, which were not available from electronic medical records, the researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.To characterise the effect of coronavirus on the production of cytokines or chemokines in the acute phase of the illness, plasma cytokines and chemokines (IL1B, IL1RA, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8 (also known as CXCL8), IL9, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL15, IL17A, Eotaxin (also known as CCL11), basic FGF2, GCSF (CSF3), GMCSF (CSF2), IFNγ, IP10 (CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2), MIP1A (CCL3), MIP1B (CCL4), PDGFB, RANTES (CCL5), TNFα, and VEGFA were measured using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma samples from four healthy adults were used as controls for cross-comparison. The median time from being transferred to a designated hospital to the blood sample collection was 4 days (IQR 2–5).Each 80 μL plasma sample from the patients and contacts was added into 240 μL of Trizol LS (10296028; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 μL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 μL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final reaction mix concentration of the primers was 500 nM and probe was 200 nM. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: 50°C for 15 min and 95°C for 3 min, 50 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 45 s. Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead. RNAaemia was defined as a positive result for real-time RT-PCR in the plasma sample.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock were defined according to the interim guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus.9WHONovel coronavirus – China.http://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/Date: Jan 12, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) of less than 300 mm Hg.15Sanz F Gimeno C Lloret T et al.Relationship between the presence of hypoxemia and the inflammatory response measured by C-reactive protein in bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia.Eur Respir J. 2011; 38: 2492Google Scholar Acute kidney injury was identified and classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification.16Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) acute kidney injury work groupKDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury.https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guideline-English.pdfDate: March, 2012Date accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Secondary infection was diagnosed if the patients had clinical symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteraemia, and was combined with a positive culture of a new pathogen from a lower respiratory tract specimen (including the sputum, transtracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or from blood samples taken ≥48 h after admission).17Garner JS Jarvis WR Emori TG Horan TC Hughes JM CDC definitions for nosocomial infections, 1988.Am J Infect Control. 1988; 16: 128-140Summary\n",

Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care (nine [69%]) and those with non-ICU care (18 [64%]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The first fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward.The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38; table 1).

Three of the four patients with secondary infection had procalcitonin greater than 0·5 ng/mL (0·69 ng/mL, 1·46 ng/mL, and 6·48 ng/mL).On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. Of the 41 patients, 40 (98%) had bilateral involvement (table 2). The typical findings of chest CT images of ICU patients on admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3A). The representative chest CT findings of non-ICU patients showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3B).

Plasma levels of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between healthy adults and patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Further comparison between ICU and non-ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα were higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients.All patients had pneumonia. Common complications included ARDS (12 [29%] of 41 patients), followed by RNAaemia (six [15%] patients), acute cardiac injury (five [12%] patients), and secondary infection (four [10%] patients; table 3). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in four (10%) patients, with two of them (5%) had refractory hypoxaemia and received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as salvage therapy. All patients were administered with empirical antibiotic treatment, and 38 (93%) patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir). Additionally, nine (22%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. A comparison of clinical features between patients who received and did not receive systematic corticosteroids is in the appendix (pp 1–5).Table 3Treatments and outcomes of patients infected with 2019-nCoVAll patients (n=41)ICU care (n=13)No ICU care (n=28)p valueDuration from illness onset to first admission7·0 (4·0–8·0)7·0 (4·0–8·0)7·0 (4·0–8·5)0·87ComplicationsAcute respiratory distress syndrome12 (29%)11 (85%)1 (4%)<0·0001RNAaemia6 (15%)2 (15%)4 (14%)0·93Cycle threshold of RNAaemia35·1 (34·7–35·1)35·1 (35·1–35·1)34·8 (34·1–35·4)0·35Acute cardiac injury** Defined as blood levels of hypersensitive troponin I above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/mL) or new abnormalities shown on electrocardiography and echocardiography.5 (12%)4 (31%)1 (4%)0·017Acute kidney injury3 (7%)3 (23%)00·027Secondary infection4 (10%)4 (31%)00·0014Shock3 (7%)3 (23%)00·027TreatmentAntiviral therapy38 (93%)12 (92%)26 (93%)0·46Antibiotic therapy41 (100%)13 (100%)28 (100%)NAUse of corticosteroid9 (22%)6 (46%)3 (11%)0·013Continuous renal replacement therapy3 (7%)3 (23%)00·027Oxygen support......<0·0001Nasal cannula27 (66%)1 (8%)26 (93%)..Non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula10 (24%)8 (62%)2 (7%)..Invasive mechanical ventilation2 (5%)2 (15%)0..Invasive mechanical ventilation and ECMO2 (5%)2 (15%)0..Prognosis......0·014Hospitalisation7 (17%)1 (8%)6 (21%)..Discharge28 (68%)7 (54%)21 (75%)..Death6 (15%)5 (38%)1 (4%)..Data are median (IQR) or n (%). p values are comparing ICU care and no ICU care. 2019-nCoV=2019 novel coronavirus.

ECMO=extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.As of Jan 22, 2020, 28 (68%) of 41 patients have been discharged and six (15%) patients have died. Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least 10 days, with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from upper respiratory tract.We report here a cohort of 41 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Patients had serious, sometimes fatal, pneumonia and were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan, China, by Jan 2, 2020. Clinical presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. The time between hospital admission and ARDS was as short as 2 days. At this stage, the mortality rate is high for 2019-nCoV, because six (15%) of 41 patients in this cohort died.The number of deaths is rising quickly. As of Jan 24, 2020, 835 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections were reported in China, with 25 fatal cases. Reports have been released of exported cases in many provinces in China, and in other countries; some health-care workers have also been infected in Wuhan. Taken together, evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019-nCoV. We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission.19Perlman S Netland J Coronaviruses post-SARS: update on replication and pathogenesis.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009; 7: 439-450Crossref\n",

To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored among health-care workers. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymptomatic infections.Similarities of clinical features between 2019-nCoV and previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans.

Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection.Our study has some limitations. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariable-adjusted methods. This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity. At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies.Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively.35Cui J Li F Shi Z-L Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2019; 17: 181-192Crossref\n",

      "Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the use of face masks has become ubiquitous in China and other Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan. Some provinces and municipalities in China have enforced compulsory face mask policies in public areas; however, China's national guideline has adopted a risk-based approach in offering recommendations for using face masks among health-care workers and the general public. We compared face mask use recommendations by different health authorities (panel). Despite the consistency in the recommendation that symptomatic individuals and those in health-care settings should use face masks, discrepancies were observed in the general public and community settings.1WHOCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: when and how to use masks.https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masksDate: 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar,  2State Council, ChinaGuidelines for the selection and use of different types of masks for preventing new coronavirus infection in different populations 2020 (in Chinese).http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2020-02/05/content_5474774.htmDate: Feb 5, 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar,  3The Department of Health, Hong KongGuidelines on prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for the general public.https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/nid_guideline_general_public_en.pdfDate: Mar 13, 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar,  4Ministry of Health, SingaporeUpdates on COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) local situation.https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar,  5Ministry of HealthLabour and Wellfare, JapanQ & A on coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19): when should I wear a facemask?.https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/dengue_fever_qa_00014.htmlDate: 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar,  6CDCCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): steps to prevent illness.https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.htmlDate accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar,  7National Health ServiceAre face masks useful for preventing coronavirus?.https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/common-questions/Date: 2020Date accessed: March 5, 2020Google Scholar,  8Federal Ministry of Health, GermanyDaily updates on the coronavirus: is wearing a surgical mask, as protection against acute respiratory infections, useful for members of the general public?.https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/press/2020/coronavirus.htmlDate: 2020Date accessed: March 5, 2020Google Scholar For example, the US Surgeon General advised against buying masks for use by healthy people.

According to WHO, wearing a mask in situations where it is not recommended to do so can create a false sense of security because it might lead to neglecting fundamental hygiene measures, such as proper hand hygiene.However, there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence. Evidence that face masks can provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce, as acknowledged in recommendations from the UK and Germany.7National Health ServiceAre face masks useful for preventing coronavirus?.https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/common-questions/Date: 2020Date accessed: March 5, 2020Google Scholar,  8Federal Ministry of Health, GermanyDaily updates on the coronavirus: is wearing a surgical mask, as protection against acute respiratory infections, useful for members of the general public?.https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/press/2020/coronavirus.htmlDate: 2020Date accessed: March 5, 2020Google Scholar However, face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections. It would be reasonable to suggest vulnerable individuals avoid crowded areas and use surgical face masks rationally when exposed to high-risk areas. As evidence suggests COVID-19 could be transmitted before symptom onset, community transmission might be reduced if everyone, including people who have been infected but are asymptomatic and contagious, wear face masks.Recommendations on face masks vary across countries and we have seen that the use of masks increases substantially once local epidemics begin, including the use of N95 respirators (without any other protective equipment) in community settings. This increase in use of face masks by the general public exacerbates the global supply shortage of face masks, with prices soaring,9WHOShortage of personal protective equipment endangering health workers worldwide.https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/03-03-2020-shortage-of-personal-protective-equipment-endangering-health-workers-worldwideDate: March 3, 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar and risks supply constraints to frontline health-care professionals. As a response, a few countries (eg, Germany and South Korea) banned exportation of face masks to prioritise local demand.10Tsang A EU seeks solidarity as nations restrict medical exports.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/business/eu-exports-medical-equipment.htmlDate: March 7, 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar WHO called for a 40% increase in the production of protective equipment, including face masks.9WHOShortage of personal protective equipment endangering health workers worldwide.https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/03-03-2020-shortage-of-personal-protective-equipment-endangering-health-workers-worldwideDate: March 3, 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar Meanwhile, health authorities should optimise face mask distribution to prioritise the needs of frontline health-care workers and the most vulnerable populations in communities who are more susceptible to infection and mortality if infected, including older adults (particularly those older than 65 years) and people with underlying health conditions.People in some regions (eg, Thailand, China, and Japan) opted for makeshift alternatives or repeated usage of disposable surgical masks. Notably, improper use of face masks, such as not changing disposable masks, could jeopardise the protective effect and even increase the risk of infection.Consideration should also be given to variations in societal and cultural paradigms of mask usage. The contrast between face mask use as hygienic practice (ie, in many Asian countries) or as something only people who are unwell do (ie, in European and North American countries) has induced stigmatisation and racial aggravations, for which further public education is needed. One advantage of universal use of face masks is that it prevents discrimination of individuals who wear masks when unwell because everybody is wearing a mask.It is time for governments and public health agencies to make rational recommendations on appropriate face mask use to complement their recommendations on other preventive measures, such as hand hygiene. WHO currently recommends that people should wear face masks if they have respiratory symptoms or if they are caring for somebody with symptoms. Perhaps it would also be rational to recommend that people in quarantine wear face masks if they need to leave home for any reason, to prevent potential asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission. In addition, vulnerable populations, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, should wear face masks if available. Universal use of face masks could be considered if supplies permit. In parallel, urgent research on the duration of protection of face masks, the measures to prolong life of disposable masks, and the invention on reusable masks should be encouraged. Taiwan had the foresight to create a large stockpile of face masks; other countries or regions might now consider this as part of future pandemic plans.View Large\n",

      "“When this is all over, the NHS England board should resign in their entirety.” So wrote one National Health Service (NHS) health worker last weekend. The scale of anger and frustration is unprecedented, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the cause. The UK Government's Contain–Delay–Mitigate–Research strategy failed. It failed, in part, because ministers didn't follow WHO's advice to “test, test, test” every suspected case. They didn't isolate and quarantine. They didn't contact trace. These basic principles of public health and infectious disease control were ignored, for reasons that remain opaque. The UK now has a new plan—Suppress–Shield–Treat–Palliate. But this plan, agreed far too late in the course of the outbreak, has left the NHS wholly unprepared for the surge of severely and critically ill patients that will soon come. I asked NHS workers to contact me with their experiences. Their messages have been as distressing as they have been horrifying. “It's terrifying for staff at the moment. Still no access to personal protective equipment [PPE] or testing.” “Rigid command structures make decision making impossible.” “There's been no guidelines, it's chaos.” “I don't feel safe. I don't feel protected.” “We are literally making it up as we go along.” “It feels as if we are actively harming patients.” “We need protection and prevention.” “Total carnage.” “NHS Trusts continue to fail miserably.” “Humanitarian crisis.” “Forget lockdown—we are going into meltdown.” “When I was country director in many conflict zones, we had better preparedness.” “The hospitals in London are overwhelmed.” “The public and media are not aware that today we no longer live in a city with a properly functioning western health-care system.” “How will we protect our patients and staff…I am speechless. It is utterly unconscionable. How can we do this? It is criminal…NHS England was not prepared…We feel completely helpless.”View Large\n",

I am sure Dr Harries believed what she said. But she was wrong and she should apologise to the thousands of health workers who still have no access to WHO-standard PPE. I receive examples daily of doctors having to assess patients with respiratory symptoms but who do so without the necessary PPE to complete their jobs safely. Health workers are challenged if they ask for face masks. Even where there is PPE, there may be no training. WHO standards are not being met. Proper testing of masks is being omitted. Stickers with new expiry dates are being put on PPE that expired in 2016. Doctors have been forced to go to hardware stores to buy their own face masks. Patients with suspected COVID-19 are mixing with non-COVID-19 patients. The situation is so dire that staff are frequently breaking down in tears. As one physician wrote, “The utter failure of sound clinical leadership will lead to an absolute explosion of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.” Front-line staff are already contracting and dying from the disease.View Large\n",

      "                                © 2020 Ian Vogler/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesThe NHS has been wholly unprepared for this pandemic. It's impossible to understand why. Based on their modelling of the Wuhan outbreak of COVID-19, Joseph Wu and his colleagues wrote in The Lancet on Jan 31, 2020: “On the present trajectory, 2019-nCoV could be about to become a global epidemic…for health protection within China and internationally…preparedness plans should be readied for deployment at short notice, including securing supply chains of pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, hospital supplies, and the necessary human resources to deal with the consequences of a global outbreak of this magnitude.” This warning wasn't made lightly. It should have been read by the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Executive Officer of the NHS in England, and the Chief Scientific Adviser. They had a duty to immediately put the NHS and British public on high alert. February should have been used to expand coronavirus testing capacity, ensure the distribution of WHO-approved PPE, and establish training programmes and guidelines to protect NHS staff. They didn't take any of those actions. The result has been chaos and panic across the NHS. Patients will die unnecessarily. NHS staff will die unnecessarily. It is, indeed, as one health worker wrote last week, “a national scandal”. The gravity of that scandal has yet to be understood.View Large\n",

      "The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility.

A phone line or online service specifically set up for those in quarantine and staffed by health-care workers who can provide instructions about what to do in the event of developing illness symptoms, would help reassure people that they will be cared for if they become ill.

The benefits of such a resource have not been studied, but it is likely that reassurance could subsequently decrease feelings such as fear, worry, and anger.There is evidence to suggest that support groups specifically for people who were quarantined at home during disease outbreaks can be helpful.

In other contexts, however, feeling that others will benefit from one's situation can make stressful situations easier to bear and it seems likely that this is also true for home-based quarantine.

It is unacceptable to ask people to self-quarantine for the benefit of the community's health, when while doing so they might be putting their loved ones at risk.Quarantine is one of several public health measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and as shown in this Review, has a considerable psychological impact for those affected. As such, there is a question as to whether other public health measures that prevent the need to impose quarantine (such as social distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, and school closures) might be more favourable. Future research is needed to establish the effectiveness of such measures.The strengths and limitations of this Review must be considered. Because of the time constraints of this Review given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the reviewed literature did not undergo formal quality appraisal. Additionally, the Review was limited to peer-reviewed publications and we did not explore potentially relevant grey literature. The recommendations we have made apply primarily to small groups of people in dedicated facilities and to some extent in self-isolation. Although we anticipate that many of the risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes would be the same for larger containment processes (such as entire towns or cities), there are likely to be distinct differences in such situations that mean that the information presented in this Review should only be applied to such situations cautiously. Furthermore, potential cultural differences need to be considered. Although this Review cannot predict exactly what will happen or provide recommendations that will work for every future population that is quarantined, we have provided an overview of the key issues and how they could be rectified in the future.There are also several limitations of the reviewed literature, which must be pointed out: only one study followed up participants over time, sample sizes were generally small, few studies directly compared participants quarantined with those not quarantined, conclusions based on certain study populations (eg, students) might not be generalisable to the wider public, and heterogeneity of outcome measures across studies make it difficult to make direct comparisons between studies. It is also worth pointing out that a minority of studies assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress using measures designed to measure post-traumatic stress disorder, despite quarantine not being qualified as a trauma in the diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5.43American Psychiatric AssociationDiagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5.

      "Google Scholar However, depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled carefully. If quarantine is essential, then our results suggest that officials should take every measure to ensure that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people. This can be achieved by: telling people what is happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling. Health officials charged with implementing quarantine, who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security, should also remember that not everyone is in the same situation. If the quarantine experience is negative, the results of this Review suggest there can be long-term consequences that affect not just the people quarantined but also the health-care system that administered the quarantine and the politicians and public health officials who mandated it.Our search strategy was designed to inform this Review and a second review to be published elsewhere relating to adherence to quarantine. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The full list of search terms can be found in the appendix. In brief, we used a combination of terms relating to quarantine (eg, “quarantine” and “patient isolation”) and psychological outcomes (eg, “psych” and “stigma”).

(preprint).DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546Google Scholar Here, we report the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions.We first measured the stability of SARS-CoV-2 at different temperatures. SARS-CoV-2 in virus transport medium (final concentration ∼6·8 log unit of 50% tissue culture infectious dose [TCID50] per mL) was incubated for up to 14 days and then tested for its infectivity (appendix p 1). The virus is highly stable at 4°C, but sensitive to heat. At 4°C, there was only around a 0·7 log-unit reduction of infectious titre on day 14. With the incubation temperature increased to 70°C, the time for virus inactivation was reduced to 5 mins.We further investigated the stability of this virus on different surfaces. Briefly, a 5 μL droplet of virus culture (∼7·8 log unit of TCID50 per mL) was pipetted on a surface (appendix p 1; ∼cm2 per piece) and left at room temperature (22°C) with a relative humidity of around 65%. The inoculated objects retrieved at desired time-points were immediately soaked with 200 μL of virus transport medium for 30 mins to elute the virus. Therefore, this recovery of virus does not necessarily reflect the potential to pick up the virus from casual contact. No infectious virus could be recovered from printing and tissue papers after a 3-hour incubation, whereas no infectious virus could be detected from treated wood and cloth on day 2. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on smooth surfaces. No infectious virus could be detected from treated smooth surfaces on day 4 (glass and banknote) or day 7 (stainless steel and plastic). Strikingly, a detectable level of infectious virus could still be present on the outer layer of a surgical mask on day 7 (∼0·1% of the original inoculum). Interestingly, a biphasic decay of infectious SARS-CoV-2 could be found in samples recovered from these smooth surfaces (appendix pp 2–7). 39 representative non-infectious samples tested positive by RT-PCR3Chu DKW Pan Y Cheng SMS et al.Molecular diagnosis of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia.Clin Chem. 2020;  (published online Jan 31.)DOI:10.1093/clinchem/hvaa029Crossref\n",

      "Google Scholar ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19.If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, it could lead to a conflict regarding treatment because ACE2 reduces inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. A further aspect that should be investigated is the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, and hypertension, specifically in Asian populations. Summarising this information, the sensitivity of an individual might result from a combination of both therapy and ACE2 polymorphism.We suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Based on a PubMed search on Feb 28, 2020, we did not find any evidence to suggest that antihypertensive calcium channel blockers increased ACE2 expression or activity, therefore these could be a suitable alternative treatment in these patients.View Large\n",

      "A case fatality ratio of an infectious disease measures the proportion of all individuals diagnosed with a disease who will die from that disease. For an emerging infectious disease, this ratio is thus a very important indicator not only of disease severity but also of its significance as a public health problem. For instance, WHO estimated a case fatality ratio of approximately 14–15% for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003,1WHOUpdate 49—SARS case fatality ratio, incubation period.https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/Date: May 7, 2003Date accessed: March 21, 2020Google Scholar and approximately 35% for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012.2WHOMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): key facts.https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)Date: March 11, 2019Date accessed: March 21, 2020Google ScholarThe ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belonging to a large family of coronaviruses that also includes SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). COVID-19 was first reported in December, 2019, in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, and spread very rapidly to all other prefectures in Hubei, as well as all other provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions of China, and more than 180 other countries and territories.

The authors argue that crude case fatality ratios obtained by simply dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases can be misleading because there can be a period of 2–3 weeks between a person developing symptoms and that case being detected and reported, and because surveillance of a novel virus is biased towards detecting severe cases, especially at the beginning of an outbreak when test capacity is low. By using individual-case data from mainland China (3665 cases) and 1334 cases detected outside of mainland China, assuming a constant attack rate by age, and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment, Verity and colleagues estimate the mean duration from symptom onset to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).

Even though the fatality rate is low for younger people, it is very clear that any suggestion of COVID-19 being just like influenza is false: even for those aged 20–29 years, once infected with SARS-CoV-2, the case fatality ratio is around three times higher than that of seasonal influenza in people aged 18–49 years. For people aged 60 years and older, the chance of survival following SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately 95% in the absence of comorbid conditions.

      "                                © 2014 Sabin Vaccine InstitutePublic health physician who rid Latin America of polio. He was born in Rio Pardo, Brazil, on Jan 30, 1940, and died in Washington, DC, USA, on May 28, 2014, aged 74 years.The last case of polio in Latin America was detected in 1991 in the small Peruvian town of Pichanaki. 3 years later, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) declared the disease eradicated within its region. If one man can be said to deserve personal credit for this achievement, it is Ciro de Quadros.A physician trained in public health, he joined PAHO in 1977 to advise on matters related to immunisation, and to implement the Expanded Programme on Immunization in Latin America. “At that time vaccine coverage rates were only 5 to 20%”, says Donald Henderson, Professor of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh. “What Ciro did was amazing.” He persuaded countries to join what became a hemisphere-wide effort. “Within 5 or 6 years all except Haiti had well over 80% coverage.” de Quadros also created a fund for buying vaccines on behalf of PAHO members, one of the largest ever bulk purchasing schemes in the public sector. Countries were able to buy vaccines in quantities that would otherwise have been unaffordable.It was in 1985 that de Quadros put forward his programme for eliminating polio from the Americas, an ambition that Henderson admits to having viewed with scepticism. But he succeeded—and then managed something similar for indigenous measles. Henderson attributes de Quadros's success to the way he did his job. “He travelled extensively, he talked with staff, he talked with ministers. He persuaded them that it was their programme. He could help, yes—but it was their programme.”de Quadros trained at the Catholic School of Medicine in Porto Alegre, did a master's degree in public health, and in 1967 joined the Brazilian public health service working at a health centre in the Amazon region. He became involved in the smallpox campaign and, with three colleagues, began testing the value of a surveillance and containment strategy as an alternative to the proven but unaffordable policy of mass vaccination. Over the next 8 months they identified more than 100 cases of smallpox, vaccinated all their contacts, and succeeded in breaking the chain of transmission.On the strength of this achievement de Quadros became the chief epidemiologist to WHO's smallpox eradication programme in Ethiopia. “He took on smallpox in the field with something like ten Ethiopian health officers and a dozen or so US Peace Corps people”, recalls Henderson. “Ethiopia's a big place and the roads were terrible. He was working under very difficult conditions, but within 12 months they'd turned up 600 cases.” Among those Peace Corps volunteers was Peter Carrasco, now Director of the Secretariat of the International Association of Immunization Managers based at the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, DC. Two previous Peace Corps groups had dealt with all locations that were accessible by road. “When Ciro and I hooked up we were looking at the hardest parts of Ethiopia to get to”, Carrasco recalls. There was no way they could do the job on foot, so they started to use helicopters in the highlands and camels in the desert areas.It was after the success of the Ethiopian smallpox project that de Quadros joined PAHO to head up the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Between 1994 and 1998 he spent 4 years as special adviser on vaccines to the Director-General of WHO, but continued to work for PAHO until his retirement in 2002. Even then, he maintained his lifelong connection with vaccination through his appointment as a Vice-President of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington.Throughout de Quadros's life, Henderson thinks, if he was told something couldn't be done, he wanted to do it. And usually he succeeded. “His work was a marvellous illustration of community involvement in accomplishing a task”, says Henderson. “He understood management”, adds Carrasco. He used his smallpox experience in building the Expanded Programme on Immunization and ridding Latin America of polio. “He showed the doubters, and there were many of them, that polio could be eradicated. He was very practical and had very clear insights”, says Carrasco. Despite de Quadros's many awards and the medals, “he was very down to earth”, notes Carrasco. “He was the kind of man who could sit down with an ordinary health worker, have a beer with him, and motivate that guy to do a better job.” de Quadros is survived by a wife, two daughters, and two stepsons.\n",
      "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has spread to 203 countries as of March 30, 2020, and has been officially declared a global pandemic.1WHORolling updates on coronavirus disease (COVID-19): WHO characterizes COVID-19 as a pandemic.https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happenDate accessed: March 30, 2020Google Scholar With unprecedented public health interventions, local transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appears now to have been contained in China.

The study estimated the instantaneous reproduction number in the selected locations decreased substantially after non-pharmaceutical control measures were implemented on Jan 23, 2020, and has since remained lower than 1. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in these locations was mainly driven by imported cases from Hubei until late January, which is, to some extent, similar to the transmission in January in several countries. The epidemics in Chinese provinces outside Hubei were believed to be driven by local transmission dynamics after Jan 31;3Kraemer M Yang CH Gutierrez B et al.The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China.Science. 2020;  (published online March 25.)DOI:10.1126/science.abb4218Crossref\n",

      "Google Scholar therefore, the findings of Leung and colleagues' study highlight the fact that the package of non-pharmaceutical interventions in China has the ability to contain transmission—not only imported cases, but also local transmission. The epidemic is accelerating rapidly in multiple countries, indicating shortfalls in preparedness. Given that multiple countries imposed travel restrictions against China in late January, there is a need to model whether earlier implementation of interventions such as social distancing, population behavioural change, and contact tracing would have been able to contain or mitigate the epidemic.Leung and colleagues also modelled the potential adverse consequences of premature relaxation of interventions, and found that such a decision might lead to transmissibility exceeding 1 again—ie, a second wave of infections. The finding is critical to governments globally, because it warns against premature relaxation of strict interventions. However, the effect of each intervention, or which one was the most effective in containing the spread of the virus, was not addressed in the study. While interventions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are in place, countries will need to work toward returning to normalcy; thus, knowledge of the effect of each intervention is urgently required. Air travel data were used to model the effect of travel restrictions on delaying overall epidemic progression, and were found to have a marked effect at the international scale, but only a 3–5 day delay within China.4Chinazzi M Davis JT Ajelli M et al.The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.Science. 2020;  (published online March 6.)DOI:10.1126/science.aba9757Crossref\n",

Country-specific models of the effects of travel restrictions and social distancing, as well as the alternative strategies after the relaxation of these interventions, such as the use of face masks, temperature checks, and contact tracing, are now needed.Case fatality rate (CFR) is one of the important unknowns of COVID-19. Leung and colleagues estimated the confirmed CFR (cCFR) outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·82–1·16), which was consistent with the report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.6China CDC WeeklyThe Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team.

Leung and colleagues also found the cCFR was correlated with provincial per capita gross domestic product and the availability of hospital beds per 10 000. In Wuhan, the CFR was up to 5·08% by March 28, 2020.7Wuhan Municipal Health CommissionReport of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in China (in Chinese).http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020032910315Date: March 29, 2020Date accessed: March 30, 2020Google Scholar The remarkable difference in the CFRa between these locations and Wuhan might be attributed to the difference in the degrees of health-care capacity. Therefore, consideration should be given to the variations in health-care capacity when implementing interventions. While the epidemic is growing exponentially, the health-care system will face severe burdens. Governments should act and prepare immediately to ensure that the health-care system has adequate labour, resources, and facilities to minimise the mortality risk of COVID-19.View Large\n",

      "BackgroundAs of March 18, 2020, 13 415 confirmed cases and 120 deaths related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei province—the epicentre of the outbreak—had been reported. Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak. We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei.MethodsWe estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces. We used a susceptible–infectious–recovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave.FindingsIn all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·82–1·16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5·91%, 5·73–6·09). Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt >1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level.InterpretationThe first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.FundingHealth and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong, China.As of March 18, 2020, 13 415 confirmed cases and 120 deaths related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei province—the epicentre of the outbreak—had been reported.

Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, has been locked down since Jan 23, with 16 of its neighbouring cities in Hubei province included behind the cordon sanitaire shortly thereafter. The national Spring Festival holiday was extended by 8 days to Feb 7, and most schools have remained closed to date. As the Spring Festival holiday ended, stringent social distancing measures and mobility restrictions were coordinated and implemented by the central and local governments in many Chinese megacities (ie, the largest and wealthiest; figure 1), including Beijing (north of Wuhan), Guangzhou and Shenzhen (south), Shanghai and Hangzhou (east), and Chengdu (west). For example, only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down. Although the aggressive countermeasures appear to have reduced the number of reported cases, the absence of herd immunity against COVID-19 suggests that counts could easily resurge when these interventions are relaxed, as business, factory operations, and schools resume.Figure 1Timeline of events between Jan 23 and Feb 17, 2020Show full caption(A) The number of confirmed cases reported outside Hubei province in mainland China.

On the other hand, COVID-19 has spread to more than 100 countries or regions, and local epidemics have been established in multiple countries, including the USA and most countries in Europe. On March 10, Italy, the worst-hit country outside China, with more than 10 000 cases, imposed a nationwide lockdown, which is expected to be in place until at least early April. Most countries in Europe have imposed stringent control measures to limit social contacts. As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, escalating case importation from overseas or residual infected seeds within China (despite the almost 2-month-long containment policy nationwide), coupled with the resumption of economic activities, a second wave of COVID-19 appears probable. Thus, we simulated the potential consequences of relaxing restrictions in anticipation of a recrudescence of infections.Research in contextEvidence before this studySince Jan 23, 2020, massive public health interventions have been implemented across China to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published up to March 17, 2020, that contained information about the control measures against COVID-19 outbreak using the terms “coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, “COVID-19”, “control measures”, “outside Wuhan and/or Hubei”, and “Chinese New Year”. We found five studies that reported the estimates of the effects of control measures on COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan or Hubei, but no study focused on the regions outside Wuhan or Hubei.Added value of this studyIn regions outside Hubei, the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 substantially decreased after aggressive control measures were implemented on Jan 23, 2020, and have since remained below 1. Control measures should be relaxed gradually so that the resulting Rt would not sustainably exceed 1. Otherwise, the cumulative case count would increase exponentially with the relaxation duration. The confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) outside Hubei was 0·98%, but varied substantially among different provinces, probably due to heterogeneity in regional economic development and availability of health-care resources.Implications of all the available evidenceAlthough the first wave of COVID-19 in Chinese provinces outside Hubei has abated because of the aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave, given the increasing risk of viral reintroduction from overseas importation.Evidence before this studySince Jan 23, 2020, massive public health interventions have been implemented across China to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Although Beijing, Shanghai, and Wenzhou had few importations from Hubei during the Spring Festival, Shenzhen had a considerable proportion of imported cases from Hubei, even 2 weeks after Wuhan's lockdown. However, from Feb 7 onward, all four cities began to report imported cases from Hubei again, suggesting it might be a challenge to maintain subthreshold Rt when economic activities fully resume in the presence of exponentially increasing case importation from locations with ongoing community transmission of COVID-19 (eg, Hubei domestically, and Italy, South Korea, or Iran internationally). The cumulative number of importations from overseas increased from 20 to 353 between March 4 and March 22; most of these importations were reported by megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Containment measures based on isolation and contact tracing will eventually fail if case exportation continues to grow exponentially, which seems probable given that local transmission has already been established in many large countries, including the USA and most European countries.We estimated that cCFR among officially confirmed cases outside Hubei was 0·98% (0·82–1·16), ranging from 0·00% (0·00–0·58) in Jiangsu to 1·76% (1·11–2·65) in Henan among the ten provinces that reported the largest number of confirmed cases (figure 4). For reference, Hubei's cCFR was 5·91% (5·73–6·09). Given the intensive, proactive case finding and the sharp drop in reported cases outside Hubei during February, 2020, the ascertainment rates in these cities were probably very high. As such, we posit that cCFR in areas outside Hubei should be roughly comparable to the symptomatic CFR (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) in Wuhan (estimated to be 1·4% [0·9–2·1] in a separate analysis19Wu JT Leung K Bushman M et al.Estimating clinical severity of COVID-19 from the transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China.Nat Med. 2020;  (published online March 19.)DOI:10.1038/s41591-020-0822-7Crossref\n",

Taken together, these results suggest that allowing Rt to rise above 1 when the epidemic size was still small (ie, no herd immunity) would likely incur both health and economic loss even if aggressive interventions could push the prevalence back to pre-relaxation level afterwards.Figure 5The effect of relaxation of interventions for different scenarios of reproduction numbersShow full captionR2 and R4 refer to the reproduction number when stage 2 and 4 began, respectively.

The daily number of local COVID-19 cases has dropped substantially to nearly zero in areas outside Hubei since late February; however, a second wave of COVID-19 transmission is possible because of viral reintroduction (particularly international importation—eg, from Italy or elsewhere in Europe, Iran, USA, and other rapidly burgeoning secondary epicentres22Centre for Systems Science Engineering at Johns HopkinsCoronavirus COVID-19 global cases by the Centre for Systems Science Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins.https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Date: 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar) that has been exponentially increasing since March, 2020, as well as viral transmissibility that might rebound with the gradual resumption of economic activities, and thus normal levels of social mixing. Close monitoring of the instantaneous effective reproduction number and real-time tuning of policy interventions to ensure a manageable second wave remains the over-riding public health priority.Early detection of cases is essential. Guangdong province did more than 320 000 RT-PCR tests on those who had attended fever clinics and hospitals over 30 days between January and February, 2020, which was about ten times baseline testing capacity for routine influenza-like illness surveillance during the influenza season of 2018.23Kang M Tan X Yang Y Wu J Zheng H Song T Epidemiological characteristics of influenza in Guangdong province, during winter of 2017–2018.Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2018; 39: 1071-1076PubMed\n",
      "Google Scholar Such a level of testing should be maintained, if not increased, to monitor the real-time point prevalence of COVID-19, so that any possible reintroduction of infected cases could be swiftly identified and isolated, and their contacts traced and quarantined.Our schematic scenario simulated how control measures could be tuned to minimise the total infected burden, thus corollary adverse health, and social and economic effects, by maintaining the effective reproduction number below the self-sustaining threshold of 1. Our results highlight that as the number of cases would progressively rise when Rt > 1, simply tightening control interventions again to maintain Rt=1 would not reduce the burden back to its original baseline. Once elevated at the higher level, it could only be pushed back down to the original baseline by extra effort, by driving Rt down below unity. Therefore, relaxation of interventions to allow Rt > 1 would probably incur both marginally higher health and economic loss, even if the disease prevalence could subsequently be pushed back to pre-relaxation level. Thus, proactively striking a balance between resuming economic activities and keeping Rt below 1 is likely to be the optimal strategy until effective vaccines become widely available, despite the fact that control policies, including social distancing, behavioural change, and public awareness, will probably be maintained for some time.24Chen H Xu W Paris C Reeson A Li X Social distance and SARS memory: impact on the public awareness of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 11.)DOI:10.1101/2020.03.11.20033688Google ScholarChina could adopt a reinforcement learning approach to achieve such a delicate balance (namely, maximising economic productivity under the Rt ≤ 1 constraint) by continuous surveillance of the effect of social mixing and human mobility on the reproduction number of COVID-19 and then tune socioeconomic activities accordingly. In the conventional framework of inferring Rt from epidemic curve data (as we have done), the lead time between actual changes in Rt and the detection of such changes is roughly equal to the sum of the incubation period and reporting delay (although the latter could be adjusted for, as we have done). We postulate that such lead time might be shortened if reliable analytics could be developed to predict Rt from digital proxies for social mixing and human mobility. Specifically, the resumption of economic activities and normal societal functions can be digitally monitored in various ways by the cloud platforms of Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent.25China Academy of Information and Communications TechnologyResearch report of the application of data and intelligence in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.http://www.caict.ac.cn/kxyj/qwfb/ztbg/202003/P020200305495005485729.pdfDate: 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar As of March 10, the Alipay and WeChat Health Code system had been used more than 1·6 billion times, and its usage patterns reflect the level of economic activities in real time.26Mozur P Zhong R Krolik A In coronavirus fight, China gives citizens a color code, with red flags.The New York Times. March 1, 2020; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.htmlDate accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar The decline in Rt in the four selected cities correlated with the decrease in intracity traffic volumes recorded by Baidu (appendix p 6). Using the intracity traffic volume on Jan 1–15 as the index, to date, the level of economic activities of the four selected cities have been at half the normal pre-outbreak levels. Closely monitoring Rt and such digital indices could enable finetuning of control measures to effectively minimise the potential adverse effects of a possible second wave of infections. Given the pivotal role of Rt in epidemic control, we suggest that real-time estimates of Rt should be presented in the routine COVID-19 dashboards and situation reports for provincial, national, and supranational health agencies.Keeping close watch of real-time transmissibility will also help to ensure the infection prevalence does not exceed the surge capacity of the health system. For example, even in the most prosperous and well resourced megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, with 5·7, 6·0, and 3·7 hospital beds per 1000 population, respectively, health-care resources are finite.27National Bureau of Statistics of ChinaNational data.http://data.stats.gov.cn/english/Date: 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar If 20% of COVID-19 cases were to require hospital admission28The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology TeamThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19)—China.China CDC Weekly. 2020; 2: 113-122Google Scholar and infection prevalence was 0·5% at any single point in time, Shenzhen would be required to deploy 27% of its total number of hospital beds.

This situation has already been observed in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei.31BloombergHospitals in China, overwhelmed by coronavirus, turn away patients with other pressing needs.Time.

The cCFR was relatively low in south and east China, and substantially higher in the north and northwest, which also correlates with provincial per capita gross domestic product (appendix pp 4, 11). Prosperous regions, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, had the lowest cCFRs among provinces that had more than 500 confirmed cases, whereas less developed regions, such as Henan, Hebei, and Heilongjiang, had the highest cCFRs. Guangdong, the richest province in the country, has the largest number of migrant workers in China and thus a high proportion of imported cases of COVID-19 from Hubei.12WHOReport of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), 16–24 February, 2020.

      "        Geneva2020https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdfDate accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar Guangdong's health-care system, with the second lowest number of hospital beds per 10 000 population, sustained an enormous stress to its surge capacity, which is perhaps reflected by its mid-level cCFR ranking. Similarly, for megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Shenzhen, the cCFRs ranked in the middle, despite their economic prosperity and relatively robust health-care infrastructure (appendix pp 5, 11). Although we did not have data on the proportion of hospital beds occupied during the first wave, given that there were fewer than 1000 confirmed cases in most cities and provinces (compared with approximately 123 600, 139 000, and 45 700 hospital beds overall in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, respectively), it was unlikely that the additional burden could have been overwhelming for the health systems outside Hubei.Several limitations should be noted. First, the estimation of Rt was based on the reported number of confirmed cases. Although there might be less under-reporting and ascertainment bias in provinces outside Hubei, our work shows the fundamental importance of a regularly (preferably daily) updated and sufficiently detailed line list. Second, the estimation of Rt relied on an accurate estimate of the serial interval distribution, where nearly half of the publicly available paired infector–infectee data points are currently derived from Shenzhen (appendix pp 7–9). Third, travel history or epidemiological links to Hubei were another essential element, because the proportion of imported cases varied over time and across locations. Although most cases in Wenzhou were local cases since Feb 4, the majority of confirmed cases in Shenzhen consisted mostly of imported cases from Hubei even up until Feb 12—more than 2 weeks after the Wuhan lockdown on Jan 23. Fourth, the simulations of intervention relaxation were done for a limited number of illustrative scenarios regarding temporal changes in the reproduction number. We did not attempt to relate which interventions and public responses to the epidemic might correspond to each of these scenarios.We found that at least 235 (56%) of 417 cases reported in Shenzhen were from clusters, among which more than 80% were household clusters. The proportion was even higher if we considered that some imported cases formed clusters with their close contacts in Hubei (although such information was missing in the Shenzhen line list). Further investigation of the transmission dynamics within households would require detailed data on household composition and demographics of household members,32Cauchemez S Donnelly CA Reed C et al.Household transmission of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus in the United States.N Engl J Med. 2009; 361: 2619-2627Crossref\n",

      "Google ScholarWe found that Rt estimates were difficult to interpret if we included the two potential superspreading events in the prisons for the Rt estimation in Zhejiang and Shandong (figure 3; appendix pp 1–2). However, the number of superspreading events is increasing as COVID-19 spreads outside mainland China; for example, in places of worship in Hong Kong and Daegu of South Korea, in a mental health facility in Daegu, and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. A comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases in each superspreading event cluster will be essential to understand the transmission of superspreading events. Combining information on COVID-19 transmission in the superspreading events, households, and community would enable better understanding of the overall Rt estimates, which would further enhance the effectiveness of control measures, if they are accordingly and precisely designed.In conclusion, the interventions China implemented in response to the COVID-19 outbreak had a real and dramatic effect on interrupting transmission in all areas outside of Hubei. As economic activity continues to resume in the coming weeks, real-time assessment by monitoring the instantaneous effective reproduction number could allow policy makers to tune relaxation decisions to maintain transmissibility to below the self-sustaining threshold of 1. CFRs vary between provinces, which might be determined by health-care availability, quality, and surge capacity.

COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.Patient 2 was a woman, aged 58 years, with diabetes, arterial hypertension, and obesity. She developed progressive respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and subsequently developed multi-organ failure and needed renal replacement therapy. On day 16, mesenteric ischaemia prompted removal of necrotic small intestine. Circulatory failure occurred in the setting of right heart failure consequent to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest resulted in death. Post-mortem histology revealed lymphocytic endotheliitis in lung, heart, kidney, and liver as well as liver cell necrosis. We found histological evidence of myocardial infarction but no sign of lymphocytic myocarditis. Histology of the small intestine showed endotheliitis (endothelialitis) of the submucosal vessels.Patient 3 was a man, aged 69 years, with hypertension who developed respiratory failure as a result of COVID-19 and required mechanical ventilation. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Circulatory collapse ensued with mesenteric ischaemia, and small intestine resection was performed, but the patient survived. Histology of the small intestine resection revealed prominent endotheliitis of the submucosal vessels and apoptotic bodies (figure C).We found evidence of direct viral infection of the endothelial cell and diffuse endothelial inflammation. Although the virus uses ACE2 receptor expressed by pneumocytes in the epithelial alveolar lining to infect the host, thereby causing lung injury, the ACE2 receptor is also widely expressed on endothelial cells, which traverse multiple organs.3Ferrario CM Jessup J Chappell MC et al.Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockers on cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.Circulation. 2005; 111: 2605-2610Crossref\n",

This study is in accordance with regulations issued by the National Health Commission of China and the Helsinki Declaration. Our findings will facilitate understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and improve clinical strategies against the disease.A 50-year-old man was admitted to a fever clinic on Jan 21, 2020, with symptoms of fever, chills, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. He reported a travel history to Wuhan Jan 8–12, and that he had initial symptoms of mild chills and dry cough on Jan 14 (day 1 of illness) but did not see a doctor and kept working until Jan 21 (figure 1). Chest x-ray showed multiple patchy shadows in both lungs (appendix p 2), and a throat swab sample was taken. On Jan 22 (day 9 of illness), the Beijing Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed by reverse real-time PCR assay that the patient had COVID-19.Figure 1Timeline of disease course according to days from initial presentation of illness and days from hospital admission, from Jan 8–27, 2020Show full captionSARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.View Large\n",

He was given interferon alfa-2b (5 million units twice daily, atomisation inhalation) and lopinavir plus ritonavir (500 mg twice daily, orally) as antiviral therapy, and moxifloxacin (0·4 g once daily, intravenously) to prevent secondary infection. Given the serious shortness of breath and hypoxaemia, methylprednisolone (80 mg twice daily, intravenously) was administered to attenuate lung inflammation. Laboratory tests results are listed in the appendix (p 4). After receiving medication, his body temperature reduced from 39·0 to 36·4 °C. However, his cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue did not improve. On day 12 of illness, after initial presentation, chest x-ray showed progressive infiltrate and diffuse gridding shadow in both lungs. He refused ventilator support in the intensive care unit repeatedly because he suffered from claustrophobia; therefore, he received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy (60% concentration, flow rate 40 L/min). On day 13 of illness, the patient's symptoms had still not improved, but oxygen saturation remained above 95%. In the afternoon of day 14 of illness, his hypoxaemia and shortness of breath worsened. Despite receiving HFNC oxygen therapy (100% concentration, flow rate 40 L/min), oxygen saturation values decreased to 60%, and the patient had sudden cardiac arrest. He was immediately given invasive ventilation, chest compression, and adrenaline injection. Unfortunately, the rescue was not successful, and he died at 18:31 (Beijing time).Biopsy samples were taken from lung, liver, and heart tissue of the patient. Histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates (figure 2A, B). The right lung showed evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; figure 2A). The left lung tissue displayed pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation, suggestive of early-phase ARDS (figure 2B). Interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, were seen in both lungs. Multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterised by large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli were identified in the intra-alveolar spaces, showing viral cytopathic-like changes. No obvious intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions were identified.Figure 2Pathological manifestations of right (A) and left (B) lung tissue, liver tissue (C), and heart tissue (D) in a patient with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2Show full captionSARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.View Large\n",

There were a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, but no other substantial damage in the heart tissue (figure 2D).Peripheral blood was prepared for flow cytometric analysis. We found that the counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells were substantially reduced, while their status was hyperactivated, as evidenced by the high proportions of HLA-DR (CD4 3·47%) and CD38 (CD8 39·4%) double-positive fractions (appendix p 3). Moreover, there was an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells (appendix p 3). Additionally, CD8 T cells were found to harbour high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, in which 31·6% cells were perforin positive, 64·2% cells were granulysin positive, and 30·5% cells were granulysin and perforin double-positive (appendix p 3). Our results imply that overactivation of T cells, manifested by increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, accounts for, in part, the severe immune injury in this patient.X-ray images showed rapid progression of pneumonia and some differences between the left and right lung. In addition, the liver tissue showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular activity, but there was no conclusive evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury as the cause.

However, there was substantial evidence that transmission surged again once schools reopened, and there was little consensus on the appropriate timing of closures, let alone reopening of schools.One way that school closures are effective during outbreaks might be through forcing parents to work at home and thus reducing work-related contacts. However, reviews have also noted the adverse effects of school closure, including economic harms to working parents, health-care workers, and other key workers being forced from work to childcare, and to society due to loss of parental productivity, transmission from children to vulnerable grandparents, loss of education, harms to child welfare particularly among the most vulnerable pupils, and nutritional problems especially to children for whom free school meals are an important source of nutrition.8Jackson C Mangtani P Vynnycky E Impact of school closures on an influenza pandemic: scientific evidence base review.

They used UK population and schools data together with data on transmission dynamics reported from the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Using data from previous influenza outbreaks, they assumed that per-capita contacts within schools were double those in households, workplaces, or the community, and that, overall, approximately a third of transmission occurred in schools. They modelled a scenario in which all schools and 25% of universities were closed and where the effect on non-school social contacts was an increase of 50% in household contact rates for families with children and a 25% increase in community contacts during the closure. They concluded that school closure as an isolated measure was predicted to reduce total deaths by around 2–4% during a COVID-19 outbreak in the UK, whereas single measures such as case isolation would be more effective, and a combination of measures would be the most effective. The authors concluded that school closure is predicted to be insufficient to mitigate (never mind suppress) the COVID-19 pandemic in isolation, which is in contrast to seasonal influenza epidemics where children are the key drivers of transmission.31Ferguson NM Laydon D Nedjati-Gilani G et al.Report 9: impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand.

We were able to include only nine published studies and seven non-peer-reviewed studies. We decided to include unreviewed studies as data would not otherwise be available on COVID-19, although findings were interpreted with caution. Except for one modelling study, none of the included studies were designed to specifically examine the effectiveness of school distancing measures. Thus, data provided on the effect of school measures were of relatively low quality.We identified a remarkable dearth of policy-relevant data on the implementation of school social distancing during coronavirus outbreaks. This finding is perhaps not surprising for the rapidly emerging COVID-19 pandemic, but previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and MERS provide limited information about the effectiveness of school closures and no data on cost-effectiveness. No data on other less disruptive school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks were identified.Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school transmission played no substantial role in the outbreak, and that school closures and other activities such as school temperature monitoring did not contribute to control of infection transmission. It is possible that these findings reflect an effect of school closures in rapidly stopping transmission; however, this is unlikely as schools remained open for prolonged periods during the early part of the outbreak.

However, they provide no data to support this assertion and indeed it might be very difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of school closures.Modelling studies from the COVID-19 pandemic support the use of national school closure as part of a package of social distancing measures. Yet, the only study to examine school closures as a separate intervention warned that the impact was relatively marginal, given the reasonable assumptions that household and community contacts would rise as a consequence.There are few data available from the literature on coronavirus outbreaks to guide countries on the use of school closures or other school social distancing practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Available evidence is consistent with a broad range of impacts of school closures, from little effect on reducing transmission through to more substantial effects. Yet, the economic costs and potential harms of school closure are undoubtedly very high.As evidence from coronavirus outbreak control is scarce, we must turn to evidence for the benefits of school closures from influenza epidemics and pandemics. School closures have been widespread in some countries during influenza pandemics, and many studies report important effects on reducing transmission and the size of the pandemic. Yet, there is considerable heterogeneity in the impact of school closures on transmission depending on characteristics of influenza serotype transmission. Systematic reviews of influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility (R<2), particularly if attack rates and transmission are higher in children than in adults.8Jackson C Mangtani P Vynnycky E Impact of school closures on an influenza pandemic: scientific evidence base review.

At the same time, these data also show that school closures can have profound economic and social consequences.More research is urgently needed on the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices to inform policies related to COVID-19. We also need more detailed knowledge about how COVID-19 affects children and young people, as the role of school measures in reducing COVID-19 transmission depends on the susceptibility of children to infection and their infectiousness once infected.12Cowling BJ Ali ST Ng TWY et al.Impact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 and influenza in Hong Kong: an observational study.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 16.)

Better learning might come from countries that have instituted later or subnational closures. Modelling studies—particularly those parameterised for COVID-19 in children, and those that can consider interaction with other contextual factors (eg, timing, parents working from home, and additional social mixing as a consequence of school closures) or different strategies (national vs staged roll out)—are likely to be more informative and are urgently needed.These findings pose a dilemma for policy makers seeking measures to protect populations. School closure presents an apparently common-sense method of dramatically reducing spread of disease and the evidence from previous influenza outbreaks appears compelling. However, policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when proposing or implementing national or regional school closures for COVID-19, given the very high costs of lengthy school closures during pandemics. Decisions about closures and their timing and length involve a series of trade-offs between conflicting factors, and a substantial loss of health-care staff to childcare duties during closures might substantially reduce any benefit to health systems and populations brought by closures of schools.50House T Baguelin M Van Hoek AJ et al.Modelling the impact of local reactive school closures on critical care provision during an influenza pandemic.Proc Biol Sci. 2011; 278: 2753-2760Crossref\n",

Examining countries that have not implemented school closures will also be important. Taiwan reopened schools in late February, 2020, relatively early in the outbreak; it has not yet initiated further large-scale closures but has been recognised to have effectively minimised spread of COVID-19. Policy makers and researchers should also look to other school social distancing interventions that are much less disruptive than full school closure and might substantially contribute to maintaining the control of this pandemic. Although strong evidence is not available for the effectiveness of these practices, they might be implementable with much less disruption, financial costs, or harms.

      "Excitement about a potential new treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic currently engulfing the world is causing problems for patients with arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who routinely use the drug to control their symptoms.The antimalarial drug chloroquine and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine have been used since the 1940s to treat autoimmune disorders, says Thomas Dörner, a rheumatologist at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin. Though the drug is rarely used for rheumatoid arthritis, around two-thirds of patients with SLE in Europe use hydroxychloroquine to manage their symptoms, and it is the only known therapy so far for primary Sjögren's syndrome, he says.But the drug has also attracted attention over the past few decades as a potential antiviral agent, currently as a possible treatment for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19. Reports from China found that chloroquine could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and showed apparent efficacy in treating COVID-19 in humans. A small non-randomised trial in France also found hydroxychloroquine to be a promising potential treatment.The findings have prompted many, including US President Donald Trump, to tout hydroxychloroquine as a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19. The US Food and Drug Administration has designated hydroxychloroquine for off-label, compassionate use for treating COVID-19, and WHO added the drug to its large global SOLIDARITY trial to test a variety of potential treatments. But virologists and infectious disease experts caution that the excitement is premature.“Whether hydroxychloroquine works in vivo is not proven for any virus, and in fact in randomised controlled trials against a number of viruses, including influenza, it doesn't work at all,” says Douglas Richman, a virologist and infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Diego. “It's my personal prejudice that this is also going to be the case with coronavirus.”Hydroxychloroquine has been studied as a possible antiviral for approximately the past 40 years, says Richman. The mechanism of action is not entirely clear, but it is known to decrease the acidity in endosomes, which might prevent the endosome from releasing the virus into the cytoplasm.Hydroxychloroquine has shown activity in vitro against many viruses, including influenza and coronaviruses, but that has largely failed to translate into success in either animals or humans. In 2005, the drug showed in vitro activity against SARS-CoV, which is closely related to the current pandemic virus, but it failed to decrease viral load in mice, and clinical interest drifted away, says Christopher Tignanelli, a surgeon at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who is involved in clinical trials of COVID-19 treatments.“There is not a huge amount of pre-clinical data for this drug,” says Tignanelli. “It's mostly test-tube and anecdote.”Despite the absence of strong evidence, some people are already attempting to self-medicate with the drug, with disastrous consequences. Hydroxychloroquine can have dangerous side-effects if the dose is not carefully controlled, and cases of chloroquine poisoning have been reported in Nigeria and the USA.Additionally, the sudden interest in hydroxychloroquine has led to reports of shortages for patients who rely on the drug to treat their autoimmune disease. Kaiser Permanente, a major health-care network in the USA, is no longer filling routine prescriptions for chloroquine.“It's a challenge for us and for our patients,” says Dörner. “When I write a prescription now, I tell my patients that they might need to go to several pharmacies before they get it filled.”The Lupus Foundation of America has called on drug manufacturers to increase the production of hydroxychloroquine, to ensure that patients with SLE who need the medication will still be able to access it while it is being investigated for COVID-19. “For many people with lupus there are no alternatives to these medications,” the Foundation said in a statement.Although the existing evidence is thin, it is promising enough to warrant further study, says David Boulware, an infectious disease physician at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “When someone is sick in hospital, we throw the kitchen sink at them, but we don't always know if it works,” he says. “That's why we need clinical trials.”Boulware is leading a trial to investigate whether hydroxychloroquine could be efficacious as a post-exposure prophylactic to prevent the development of the disease, and to prevent progression of the disease to avoid admission to hospital. The trial (NCT04308668) has already enrolled around 25% of its subjects. Initial results are expected within 3–4 weeks.Though he is skeptical of its efficacy, Richman fully supports further research to establish whether hydroxychloroquine is a good option for treating COVID-19. “It's imperative that good RCTs are implemented to get answers one way or another,” he says.View Large\n",

      "                                © 2020 University of OxfordIt was the news from Wuhan, China, in the first days of 2020 that made Sarah Gilbert sit up and think. As Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Oxford in the UK, and a leading scientist at the university's Jenner Institute, her research team wasted no time in getting involved. “We had recently started thinking about an appropriate response to Disease X; how could we mobilise and focus our resources to go more quickly than we had ever gone before. And then Disease X arrived”, she says. Once the genome sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became available in mid-January, Gilbert's team set to work to design a vaccine, using recombinant DNA techniques to create a SARS-CoV-2 antigen and embedding it within a primate adenovirus vector. “At this point it all felt quite theoretical, our goal then being to design a vaccine and to have a paper published showing what was possible in terms of a rapid response to an unknown outbreak, using our adenoviral vectored vaccine technology”, she says.Gilbert's team was awarded a £2·2 million grant from the UK's National Institute for Health Research and the UK Research and Innovation in March, 2020, to scale up her team's efforts to move into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine preclinical and clinical trials. “The way various grants have been awarded to different strategic aspects of the project is important, as much of the work can go on in parallel—for example, my colleague Sandy Douglas has received funding for work on scaling up vaccine manufacturing processes at the same time as we are progressing work in developing trials”, she says. Preclinical work at Public Health England's Porton Down facility is the immediate priority, complementing parallel initiatives taking place at the US National Institutes of Health and at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia, among others. Gilbert's team has received ethical approval for a clinical trial, and conditional approval from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to screen volunteers for trial enrolment. Another reason for speed is for her team to assess the efficacy of a vaccine in volunteers who have not yet been infected. “Ideally, we need the clinical trial to be taking place when the majority of volunteers have not been exposed to the virus. We will exclude volunteers who have a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, or who have had fever or cough in the past month. Some will inevitably have been exposed, and that is useful too, as we want to know what the vaccine means for people who have been exposed to the coronavirus”, she says.Gilbert's early vaccine work at the University of Oxford started in 1994 with Adrian Hill, who today is Director of the Jenner Institute, with a focus on malaria vaccine research, and, given her particular interest in cellular immunology, the importance of T-cell responses to parasite infection. “From what we were seeing in malaria endemic regions, individuals with a specific HLA type did much better after becoming infected with malaria than others with different HLA profiles. This led us to look at creating vaccine candidates that could trigger favourable T-cell responses, rather than relying solely on antibody responses, the prevailing vaccine model at that time”, she explains. This approach coincided with advancements in recombinant DNA techniques, with vaccinologists being able to generate specific antigens that could be safely incorporated in a host virus, as an alternative to the risks associated with using live attenuated vaccines. The ability to create recombinant viral vector vaccines is a core function of Gilbert's research group at the Jenner Institute, which over the past few years has progressed work on many vaccines, including those for influenza and Zika virus and early stage trials for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine, a helpful template for the work on a COVID-19 vaccine. As Chair of the management committee that oversees initial vaccine production within the University of Oxford, Gilbert and colleagues have suspended all other concurrent vaccine research to prioritise efforts on COVID-19.Gilbert is understandably cautious when asked to map out a timetable for the trial, but hopes to have vaccinated 500 volunteers by mid-May; this will be followed by an extension of the maximum age of trial volunteers from 55 to 70 years, later moving on to the over-70 age group. Phase 3 expansion is expected to involve 5000 volunteers; results from the earlier trials will be included in the efficacy follow-up. “The best-case scenario is that by the autumn of 2020, we have an efficacy result from phase 3 and the ability to manufacture large amounts of the vaccine, but these best-case timeframes are highly ambitious and subject to change”, Gilbert says. “Our ability to determine vaccine efficacy will be affected by the amount of virus transmission in the local population over the summer, and we are also beginning to think about initiating trials with partners in other countries to increase our ability to determine vaccine efficacy”, she says.Sharing knowledge with parallel COVID-19 vaccine efforts worldwide is crucial. “WHO is in the process of creating a forum for everyone who is developing COVID-19 vaccines to come together and present their plans and initial findings. It is essential that we all measure immunological responses to the various vaccines in the same way, to ensure comparability and generalisability of our collective findings. Work is continuing at a very fast pace, and I am in no doubt that we will see an unprecedented spirit of collaboration and cooperation, convened by WHO, as we move towards a shared global goal of COVID-19 prevention through vaccination”, Gilbert says.\n",

All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91·2%]), fatigue (25 [73·5%]) and dry cough (18 [52·9%]). 15 (44·1%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20·5%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia).

All the 34 patients involved in this study had a history of direct exposure to Wuhan City before hospital admission, and none of them had any sign or symptom of COVID-19 before surgery. Of note, symptoms of COVID-19 manifested quickly after the completion of surgery, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was laboratory-confirmed soon thereafter. The length of time from hospital admission to surgery (median time, 2·5 days [IQR, 1·0–4·0]) is shorter than the median incubation time of 5·2 days obtained from a study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in Wuhan, [19Li Q.

      "Google Scholar] Most patients in ICU were older, had more underlying comorbidities and longer surgical time, and undergone more difficult surgery than patients not admitted to ICU. This suggests that old age, comorbidities, surgical time, and difficulty of operation may be risk factors for poor outcome. Compared with the symptoms in non-ICU patients, dyspnea occurred earlier in critically ill patients. The time of first symptom to dyspnea in ICU patients was much shorter than non-ICU patients. This symptom characteristic may help physicians identify patients with potential poor prognosis.The data in this study suggest that surgery may accelerate and exacerbate disease progression of COVID-19. This is derived from the following findings. The patients developed COVID-19 symptoms very shortly (average 2·6 days) after surgery completion. The median time of COVID-19 onset (which was defined as the date when the first sign or symptom was noticed) to dyspnea in the current study was 3·5 days (IQR, 2·0–5·3), which is shorter than the reported time of 8·0 days (IQR, 5·0–13·0) from the onset of first symptom to dyspnea in a study of 41 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with SARS-CoV-2, [5Huang C.

The study did not report the exact dates of patient death, but it is safe for us to say that the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was longer than 10.5 days and thus longer than that of the non-survivors in our study. In other words, it is highly likely that surgical stress occurred during the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbated disease progression and severity.Currently, no specialized medication is available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and supportive measures remain the mainstay of COVID-19 treatment. Thus, the patient's immune function is a major determinant of the disease severity, and populations with low immune function, such as older people are more vulnerable and have high mortality after COVID-19 infection.

In addition, the patients admitted to ICU showed higher counts of white blood cell and neutrophil.Our study has some similarity to a case reported during MERS-CoV outbreak. [25Seddiq N. Al-Qahtani M. Al-Tawfiq J.A.

      "Google Scholar] In the report, a 61-year-old man who was electively admitted for cardiac bypass surgery and the patient's laboratory examinations were normal despite the history of hypertension and diabetes, and MERS-CoV test was negative before the surgery. However, this patient developed MERS-CoV infection-related symptom in the 2nd day after surgery, and was tested positive for MERS-CoV on post-operative day 6, and the patient passed away on post-operative day 9. Possibility exists that this patient could be a healthy carrier of MERS-CoV who then had the virus activated by the stress of surgery. For the patients included in our current study, we performed routine laboratory tests but did not specifically test for SARS-CoV-2 before surgery by use of quantitative RT-PCR with the CDC (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention) recommended kit based on the considerations that these patients had no any sign of COVID-19 related symptoms and the CDC recommended kit was very limited and could only be used for highly suspected case of SARS-CoV-2 infection at that time. However, a thorough review of the patients' profile made us confident to believe that the 34 patients included in this study got infected before their hospital admission. We now retrospectively understand that it might be necessary and very important for a patient to be isolated for a certain period (such as the WHO recommended 14-days quarantine period) or the possibility of the new coronavirus infection being excluded before being considered for an elective surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic.Our study has several notable limitations. The sample size of the present study was small, as it was a rare situation and patients were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection. Additionally, the patients were not performed the specific SARS-CoV-2 confirmation test before surgery, due to the limited understanding of the epidemic situation and the shortage of SARS-CoV-2 kits at that time. Thus, our assumption of the intubation periods of the patients included the current study was mainly based on clinical profiles and routine laboratory tests. Nevertheless, it is our hope that the findings of the SARS-CoV-2 associated postoperative morbidity and mortality will alert the global community to be better prepared in the battle against COVID-19 infection.In summary, we described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection. This retrospective cohort study showed 44·1% patients needed ICU care, and mortality was 20·5%. Risk factors for the poor prognosis of operative patients with COVID-19 need to be further study in larger sample size.Z-YX and SL had the idea for the study.
