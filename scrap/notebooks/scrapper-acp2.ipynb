      "Background: Some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiple organ failure (1). Some experts attribute this sequence of events to a large increase in cytokines (cytokine storm) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or a secondary infection by another organism.\n",
      "Objective: To report cytokine levels in multiple body fluids from a patient with COVID-19 and ARDS, septic shock, and multiple organ failure.\n",
      "Case Report: On 20 January 2020, a 66-year-old man who had been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 developed cough and fever and treated himself at home. On 2 February, his cough and fever gradually worsened, his body temperature reached 38.7 °C, and he developed diarrhea and vomiting. He was treated at a local hospital, where his medical history included vitiligo, gastric ulcer, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He developed dyspnea 2 days later, and COVID-19 was diagnosed by a throat swab that was tested for nucleic acid. He received the antiviral drug abidol and supportive care. When his dyspnea worsened, he was transferred to the intensive care unit for noninvasive mechanical ventilation. On 11 February, mechanical ventilation was started because of a progressive decrease in blood oxygen saturation, a blood lactate level of 4 mmol/L, and a PaO2–FiO2 ratio of 186 mm Hg.\n",
      "On 17 February, the patient was transferred to the Severe COVID-19 Intensive Treatment Center of Heilongjiang Province. His COVID-19 status was confirmed as a critical type, according to guidelines from the National Health Commission (trial version 7). We treated him with antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin infusions, lung-protective ventilation, and lung recruitment and prone position ventilation. In addition, we started measuring levels of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in his blood daily and in his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pleural fluid intermittently, and we found high levels (Figure). On 23 February, we started continuous renal replacement therapy with an Oxiris filter (Baxter International), which is designed to adsorb uremic toxins, endotoxin, and cytokines. Computed tomography on 24 February showed worsening of pulmonary inflammation. On 1 March, we started extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because we could not                     maintain the patient's oxygenation with intermittent prone position ventilation. On 2 March, the patient developed septic shock and cardiac insufficiency, and we introduced an intra-aortic balloon pump. On 6 March, every-other-day plasmapheresis was started in another attempt to decrease his cytokine levels. Computed tomography on 9 March showed that the patient's lung consolidation had worsened. Unfortunately, the patient died on 14 March.\n",
