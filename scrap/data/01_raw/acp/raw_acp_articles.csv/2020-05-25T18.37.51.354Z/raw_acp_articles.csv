Should Clinicians Use Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine Alone or in Combination With Azithromycin for Treatment of COVID-19? Using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) after infection with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or to treat COVID-19 began to receive attention following preliminary reports from in vitro (1) and human (2) studies. While multiple studies are planned or under way (3, 4), it is imperative to continually synthesize the results from the best available evidence to inform point-of-care decisions about the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. These practice points are based on a rapid and living systematic evidence review conducted by the University of Connecticut Health Outcomes, Policy, and Evidence Synthesis Group and will be updated as new evidence becomes available. The practice points development and update methods are                 included in the Appendix. This version of the practice points, based on an evidence review conducted on 17 April 2020, was approved by the American College of Physicians Board of Regents on 4 May 2020 and submitted to Annals of Internal Medicine on 6 May 2020.

Chu, MD, PhD, Elie A. Akl, MD, MPH, PhD","As of 18 May 2020, the ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 4.8 million individuals worldwide and caused over 300 000 deaths (1). SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person to person through close contact and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); most deaths are caused by development of hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and supportive therapies are the mainstays of treatment of ARDS. Noninvasive ventilation is associated with fewer adverse outcomes for patients than is IMV. However, NIV creates risks for the health care workers (HCWs) caring for these patients, because of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via aerosols (2). The magnitude of this risk is not well explored in COVID-19. In contrast, IMV typically uses a closed system and thus carries a much lower risk for transmission via aerosols. Countries with large number of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation have experienced shortage of ventilators and have relied on NIV, which includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula (HFNC). Guidelines vary considerably in their recommendations on the role and optimal method of NIV, reflecting                     differences in assumed effectiveness balanced with the risk for infection to HCWs from aerosols. Hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS are common in COVID-19, but the ideal way of providing ventilation and the effect of NIV on HCWs is uncertain. Although they are different from other causes of ARDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (caused by SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (caused by MERS-CoV) may resemble ARDS in COVID-19 (3, 4). Thus, evidence from SARS and MERS may be useful to explore the effects of NIV. Commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) to inform their guidance documents, we urgently but systematically reviewed evidence to assess the benefits and harms of alternate noninvasive and invasive ventilation strategies in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. This included searching for indirect evidence (for example, that related to SARS and MERS) and for evidence on the effect of virus transmission on HCWs. By agreement with WHO on 3 April 2020, we performed an urgent systematic review to compare the effect of different ventilation techniques on important patient outcomes and the risk for transmission for coronavirus disease, including COVID-19. We adhered to Cochrane systematic review methods, rated the certainty of evidence by following the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach, prospectively registered the review on PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020178187) (Supplement 1), and followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines (5–9). We assembled a large international collaborative team of researchers, frontline and specialist clinicians, epidemiologists, patients, public health experts, and health policy experts with expertise in                     systematic reviews. The review addresses the following 4 streams of evidence: 1) studies of any design that addressed NIV for individuals with acute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by coronavirus (COVID-19, MERS, SARS); 2) systematic reviews of randomized trials that assessed the efficacy of NIV approaches in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure not due to coronavirus infection; 3) animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus; and 4) studies in adults evaluating risk for virus transmission to HCWs from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). When possible, results focus on information most relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Information related to the first stream of evidence will be continually updated and maintained as a living systematic review for at least 1 year.",/doi/10.7326/M20-2306

Carrero, Pharm, PhD","Physical distancing, hand hygiene, and disinfection of surfaces are the cornerstones of infection control during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. At the same time, governments, international agencies, policymakers, and public health officials have been debating the validity of recommending use of nonmedical masks by the general public to reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We believe that these decisions should be informed by evidence. Although no direct evidence indicates that cloth masks are effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the evidence that they reduce contamination of air and surfaces is convincing and should suffice to inform policy decisions on their use in this pandemic pending further research. Cloth does not stop isolated virions. However, most virus transmission occurs via larger particles in secretions, whether aerosol (<5 µm) or droplets (>5 µm), which are generated directly by speaking, eating, coughing, and sneezing; aerosols are also created when water evaporates from smaller droplets, which become aerosol-sized droplet nuclei. The point is not that some particles can penetrate but that some particles are stopped, particularly in the outward direction. Every virus-laden particle retained in a mask is not available to hang in the air as an aerosol or fall to a surface to be later picked up by touch. Filtration efficiency is the ability of a material to block transmission; it is expressed as a percentage (Figure) and assessed using surrogate markers, including biological aerosols. Mask standards set by ASTM International require tests with latex spheres and aerosolized Staphylococcus aureus (1), but masks are not assessed separately for every pathogen: Filtration efficiency depends on the physical retention of particles of different sizes, regardless of which pathogen the particle contains. For consistency, we calculated FE from data provided in the original work rather than presenting the data in the units chosen by the authors. PF and fit factor are synonyms. FE = filtration efficiency; PF = protection factor; TIL = total inward leakage. Cloth can block droplets and aerosols, and layers add efficiency. Filtration efficiency for single layers of different types of cotton cloth in a bioaerosol (0.2 µm) experiment was between 43% and 94%, compared with 98% to 99% for fabric from disposable medical masks (2). In a summary of similar observations, single layers of scarfs, sweatshirts, T-shirts, and towels were associated with filtration efficiency of 10% to 40% in experiments using NaCl aerosol (0.075 µm) (3). For tea towel fabric, studied with aerosol-sized particles, filtration efficiency in experiments using a bacterial marker was 83% with 1 layer and 97% with 2 layers, compared with 96% for a medical mask (4). In experiments using virus, 1 layer of tea towel had 72% efficiency and 1 layer of T-shirt fabric 51%, compared with 90% for a medical mask (4). A 2020 study confirms that                     some fabrics block clinically useful percentages of transmission, even for aerosols and even in single layers; multiple layers improve efficiency (5).",/doi/10.7326/M20-2567

Morganstein, MD","We are at war. An invisible enemy has broken through the ranks of our global society and is waging an aggressive campaign. Hospitalists are on the front lines defending our health and safety. As with other pandemics, coronavirus disease 2019 presents challenges for the well-being of citizens around the globe, resulting from fear of illness, social distancing measures, isolation and quarantines, and protracted uncertainty (1). Hospitalists and other health care workers face additional unique challenges. A transition to crisis standards of care requiring allocation of scarce resources, proximity to infected patients, concerns about bringing the infection home to family members, societal stigma, and changing procedures are creating an unprecedented strain. China, the outbreak epicenter, has already seen adverse mental health effects on health care professionals, with high rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and general distress reported                         (2). Ensuring the well-being of hospitalists at the leading edge of our health care response requires action by organizational leaders, and health care personnel alike, to preserve our most important assets in this global battle. Interventions to enhance the well-being and functioning of hospitalists and other health care workers during extreme times of stress should use the principles of psychological first aid, an evidence-based framework that enhances a sense of safety, calming, hope, self- and organizational efficacy, and social connectedness (3). During crises, leadership decisions and behaviors have a profound effect on the functioning and psychological well-being of personnel (4). Throughout health care practices, there are leaders of clinical and administrative teams and services as well as higher levels of facilities and organizations. All of these leaders have the potential to make critical contributions to the well-being of personnel during this crisis and the subsequent recovery. Leaders should prioritize the wellness and sustainment of health care professionals through prevention efforts to reduce psychological morbidity during outbreaks using psychological first aid principles (5). The following are steps that leaders can take to support their workforce and sustain patient care: Be present. This provides reassurance and a “1 team, 1 fight” approach. Take time to connect and communicate with your personnel. Communicate effectively. Information treats anxiety in a crisis. Share what you know and what you don't know. Commit to finding answers and then share them with the team. Ensure training and equipment. Obtain needed equipment and ensure training in its use. Address anticipated exposures. Speak up and take action when personnel safety is at risk.",/doi/10.7326/M20-1897

Studies suggest that many patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome experience a cytokine storm characterized by fever; hyperferritinemia; and a massive release of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and monocyte chemoattractant proteins (1). These findings led to the hypothesis that biological agents targeting specific cytokine or inflammatory pathways may improve the respiratory outcomes of patients with the most severe forms of COVID-19 (2). Objective: To describe a patient with COVID-19 and overt hemophagocytic syndrome whose response to treatment was consistent with this hypothesis. Case Report: A 51-year-old man who had received a kidney transplant was referred to our intensive care unit for cough, fever, and shortness of breath leading to the presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19. On day 1, acute respiratory failure required mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Therapy with dexamethasone (5 mg twice daily), ceftriaxone (2 g/d), and spiramycin (1.5 million units 3 times daily) was initiated. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were withdrawn. On day 2, the patient developed refractory multiorgan failure characterized by an inflammatory state, heart failure, stage 3 acute-on-chronic kidney injury, acute liver failure, nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lactic acidosis. The C-reactive protein level was 262 mg/L, and the ferritin level was 52 005 μg/L. We considered a diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome because the patient had underlying immunosuppression; fever of 39 °C; a serum ferritin level above                     6000 μg/L; a hemoglobin level below 92 g/L; a platelet count below 110 × 109 cells/L; high levels of serum triglycerides; and aspartate aminotransferase with an HScore of 253, which indicated that the probability of having hemophagocytic syndrome was 99.5% (3). Bone marrow aspiration and liver biopsy confirmed the presence of hemophagocytosis (Figure).

King, MD, MPH, Susan Gurley, MD, PhD, Michael Kiefer, MD, Erik Liederbauer, MD, Kathryn Vela, MLIS, AHIP, Payten Sonnen, BS, Devan Kansagara, MD, MCR","Concerns exist that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) increase susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the viral agent that causes the disease COVID-19) and the likelihood of severe COVID-19 illness (1). Early reports from Wuhan, China, showed that hypertension and diabetes were common among patients with COVID-19 and were associated with worse outcomes (2). Although these early studies did not specify whether patients were using ACEIs or ARBs before becoming infected, these medications are widely used to treat hypertension and diabetes (3, 4). The proposed mechanism by which ACEIs and ARBs may play a role in COVID-19 is through upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is presumed to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry to host cells (5) (Figure 1). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 exists primarily as a membrane-bound monocarboxypeptidase with robust expression in such tissues as lung, vasculature, intestine, and kidney (5). A soluble or circulating form of ACE2 (sACE2) has cardiovascular effects in the renin–angiotensin system (6–8). Related to viral pathogenesis, sACE2 was shown to block SARS viral entry into cells (9) and is now being considered as a potential therapy (10).  As part of the RAS, ACE2 (green) regulates the levels of angiotensin II. As the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 may facilitate viral entry into cells. This figure illustrates the role of ACE2 in the RAS and how pharmacologic RAS blockade with ACEIs or ARBs (red) could theoretically increase the amount of ACE2 available for viral binding. ACE2 = angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ACEI = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB = angiotensin-receptor blocker; AT1 = type 1 angiotensin receptor; RAS = renin–angiotensin system; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is distinct and not directly related to the clinical use of ACEIs or ARBs, or to their mechanisms of action. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors target angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE) to inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby reducing levels of angiotensin II available to bind and activate the type 1 angiotensin receptor (AT1), which mediates most of the vasopressor effects of angiotensin II (11). Angiotensin-receptor blockers work by binding to AT1 receptors and directly blocking the actions of angiotensin II. In contrast to ACE, which acts to generate angiotensin II, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7) and is thus a negative regulator of the renin–angiotensin system (Figure 1) (12).",/doi/10.7326/M20-1515

Since then COVID-19, with its pulmonary and other systemic manifestations, has spread globally—with more than 4.2 million cases and over 291 000 deaths in 187 countries reported (2). With spread of disease, abnormal coagulation variables with high incidence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) complications have been noted, raising the need to develop specific VTE diagnostic and therapeutic strategies (3). Complete autopsy studies were almost nonexistent in the initial phases of the outbreak; reasonably so, due to concerns related to infectivity, transmission rates, and biosafety. The few reports initially published were limited to postmortem biopsies in COVID-19–positive patients (4–6) or from lobectomy specimens initially resected for lung adenocarcinoma, but patients were later found to be COVID-19–positive (7). Pathologic features of exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) were noted in these initial reports and overlapping features with SARS were also noted. Later complete autopsies performed in United States further supported the presence of DAD (8, 9). More recently, Wichmann and colleagues (10) reported the findings of 12 consecutive, legally mandated autopsies of patients with COVID-19. The authors noted a high incidence of pulmonary embolism with or without underlying deep venous thrombosis, despite the absence of history of VTE. Massive pulmonary embolism was the cause of death in one third of the cases, with an additional one fourth with recent deep venous thrombosis but without pulmonary embolism. Seventy-five percent were men and two thirds of these were noted to have recent thrombosis in prostatic venous plexus. Preexisting coronary heart disease (50%), respiratory tract, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were noted but an absence of antemortem VTEs. Histologically exudative phase DAD was noted in two thirds and presence of pulmonary thrombi in 5 out of 8 cases with DAD. Similar histologic findings of DAD with microthrombi in 45% cases were also recently reported by Menter and associates in a series of 21 COVID-19–positive autopsies, 4 with prominent central pulmonary embolism (11). In this issue, Lax and colleagues (12) report the findings of autopsies performed on 11 patients randomly selected among 48 hospitalized COVID-19–positive decedents. Significant preexisting comorbid conditions included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, cancer, as well as history of cerebrovascular disease (ischemic stroke in 4 patients) and pulmonary embolism (1 patient). After autopsy tissue fixation, grossly visible pulmonary thrombi were noted in all cases with associated infarcts in 9 out of these 11 (81%) autopsies. During their hospital stay, 10 of the 11 deceased patients had received prophylactic dose anticoagulant therapy, with 2 receiving this therapy even before admission; thus suggesting that pulmonary thrombi were formed despite anticoagulant therapy. Apart from DAD, histologic evaluation highlighted the presence of multiple thrombi in small to mid-sized pulmonary arteries with adjacent lung parenchymal infarcts. These autopsy studies highlight the importance of thromboembolic events in COVID-19. Wichmann and colleagues highlighted the high incidence of pulmonary embolism with or without deep venous thrombosis, as well as presence of recent thrombi in prostatic venous plexus, in patients with no history of VTE, suggesting de novo coagulopathy in these patients with COVID-19. In contrast, Lax and colleagues highlighted changes consistent with thrombosis occurring within the pulmonary arterial circulation, in the absence of apparent embolism.",/doi/10.7326/M20-3255
DOI:10.7326/M20-1982,The New Normal: Key Considerations for Effective Serious Illness Communication Over Video or Telephone During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,10.7326/M20-1982,Ideas and Opinions,FREE,14 May 2020,"Lynn Flint, MD, Ashwin Kotwal, MD, MS","On 4 March 2019, a year before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic descended on the United States, a doctor delivered difficult news to a 78-year-old man who was in the intensive care unit with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1). His granddaughter, sitting beside him, recorded the interaction on her cellphone. First, we see the nurse roll in a piece of equipment with a screen. She attends to other tasks in the patient's room while a man on the screen—the doctor—begins to speak. We hear only parts of what he says: damage to the man's lungs cannot be fixed; morphine may help him feel better. The granddaughter asks her grandfather if he understands; we cannot hear his response. The clip ends. The man died the next day. His family, deeply dissatisfied with the interaction, released the video to the press, and articles with titles like “Doctor delivers end-of-life news via robot” were broadly                     disseminated. Fast forward to now. Across the country, clinicians are using telecommunication (by video or telephone) for serious illness communication with hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and their loved ones, together or separately. The term serious illness communication refers to communication between clinicians and patients about prognosis, goals, values, priorities, and recommendations for goal-concordant treatment plans (2). The pandemic brings new barriers to effective serious illness communication: widespread fear and uncertainty, surging work demands for clinicians, and the clinically appropriate but unfamiliar use of telecommunication to reduce exposure to the virus and preserve personal protective equipment. Here, we discuss how frontline clinicians can have meaningful conversations with patients who are seriously ill and their loved ones using telecommunication during this extraordinary time (Table). Serious illness communication, whether in person or by telecommunication, requires careful preparation. Clinicians should assess the patient's ability to participate, their need for a translator, and their preferences to include loved ones. An advantage of telecommunication is that loved ones can be included from a distance. A review of prior advance care planning documentation can identify legal decision makers and guide decision making when patients cannot participate. If using video, clinicians should ensure patients can use the equipment; some hospitals have engaged volunteers to help with this. If possible, a clinician should conduct visits from a private space where they can remove their mask and preserve the patient's privacy. Clinicians should identify hearing and vision impairment and adjust their environment and communication accordingly (Table). Finally, clinicians should start the actual conversation by checking in with                     themselves first—especially now with the distractions of the pandemic. A deep breath brings one into the present to focus on the needs of the patient and family. Serious illness communication requires rapid establishment of rapport and trust, which can be challenging over video or telephone (8), especially in the context of shift work and rotating clinicians. Clinicians can foster continuity by including a nurse or staff member who regularly works with the patient or an established primary care provider. Some clinicians have been redeployed as family liaisons to provide regular medical updates during the hospital stay; these liaisons can be included (9). Whenever possible, we suggest having several brief conversations rather than 1 prolonged meeting. An initial conversation without urgent decision making allows participants to adjust to telecommunication, troubleshoot technologic glitches, and begin to build rapport. Even for urgent conversations, a few minutes spent chatting about a patient's interests or background can quickly build rapport. To further build trust,                     clinicians should acknowledge that telecommunication is not optimal. If patients or family members express disappointment, clinicians can use “I wish” statements (for example, “I wish I could be there in person to support you.”). Clinicians should be mindful to demonstrate that they are listening by making eye contact with the camera, not the device screen, and giving brief verbal responses (“yes…” or “go on…”). Before the conversation, clinicians should consider their agenda: Is the communication task information sharing, providing emotional support, identifying goals and values, or decision making? Many open-source, step-by-step frameworks, some specific to COVID-19, have been disseminated, including guides to breaking bad news, identifying goals of care, and advance care planning (3–6). An advantage of telecommunication is that clinicians can have a framework up on their screen as a cheat sheet during ongoing conversations, which may be especially helpful for clinicians new to serious illness communication. However, we caution clinicians to avoid strict adherence to algorithms and to remain flexible. Asking permission at regular points in the conversation provides natural transitions, builds psychological safety, and allows patients and families some control. For example, a clinician can ask, “May I                     tell you what I understand about how your father is doing today?” Likewise, clinicians should regularly check for understanding, use summarizing statements, and orient back to patients when loved ones are also in the conversation.",/doi/10.7326/M20-1982

Kessler, MD, PhD, Norbert Kaufmann, MD, Camillo Koelblinger, MD, Klaus Vander, MD, Ute Bargfrieder, MD, Michael Trauner, MD, PhD","The pandemic spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, within a few months, led to a global health and economic crisis (1–3). COVID-19 is usually characterized by symptoms of acute respiratory infection, such as fever, headache, dry cough, and shortness of breath, but may show further symptoms involving the gastrointestinal tract (gastroenteritis-like, with vomiting and diarrhea, or a hepatitis-like picture) and the central nervous system (most notably anosmia) (4–8). Only a small subset of infected individuals becomes severely ill, requiring intensive care and with risk for death, but this number may increase dramatically through the high transmission rate of the virus (8–10). Although advanced age                     and certain comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases, have been identified as risk factors for adverse outcome and death, the individual clinical course can be highly unpredictable and dynamic, with rapid deterioration of the respiratory and hemodynamic condition (10–14). So far, very little is known about the pathologic findings underlying the clinical presentation of severe COVID-19. Only a few reports on surgical specimens and autopsy cases have been published over the past few months, and detailed information is still limited (15–17) and was in part obtained by postmortem core biopsies (18, 19). More insights from autopsies have become available from the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, showing that patients with fatal outcome predominantly had diffuse alveolar damage characterized by edema, hyaline membranes, and proliferation of pneumocytes and fibroblasts (20). Nevertheless, the pattern of organ damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 and occurring in patients with COVID-19 is still incompletely understood. In light of the currently limited options for effective antiviral treatment, it may be critical                     to better understand the morphologic basis for severe and fatal COVID-19 outcomes (21). The aim of this detailed autopsy study was to unravel the clinicopathologic basis for adverse outcomes in patients with a fatal course of COVID-19 by evaluating the gross and microscopic findings in correlation with their clinical phenotypes. We used a prospectively designed systematic approach to perform the autopsies and to study organ changes macro- and microscopically and relate them to key clinical features. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive and systematic clinicopathologic evaluation of key multiorgan involvement and failure in COVID-19. The study was prospectively designed, and all autopsies on patients with COVID-19 in our hospital were done according to the same protocol. The Hospital Graz II is the second largest public and academic teaching hospital in the region of Styria, Austria (1.2 million inhabitants) and was designated the COVID-19 center of the region at the beginning of the outbreak of the pandemic. From 28 February to 14 April 2020, 242 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our hospital, of whom 48 died. Autopsy was performed in 11 of the 48 deceased patients (23%), of whom 10 were selected at random; in 1 case, the treating intensive care specialist requested autopsy. The number of patients randomly selected for autopsy was influenced by the daily number of deceased patients, together with our infrastructural, time, and personnel constraints. There were no medical exclusion criteria. According to federal Austrian hospital law, an autopsy in a public hospital is mandatory without requirement of an informed consent by the relatives when the cause of death is unclear, scientific or public interest is present, or health                         authorities or a court order the autopsy. Nevertheless, religious reasons or an explicit wish from the patients' relatives to abstain from autopsy would be respected, if possible. In this study, autopsy was performed in accordance with the law owing to the unknown cause of death, and to both scientific and public interest in a novel disease. No informed consent was obtained from the families. All performed procedures and investigations were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.",/doi/10.7326/M20-2566

Kucirka, MD, PhD, Stephen A. Lauer, PhD, Oliver Laeyendecker, PhD, MBA, Denali Boon, PhD, Justin Lessler, PhD","Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are often used to “rule out” infection among high-risk persons, such as exposed inpatients and health care workers. Hence, it is critical to understand how the predictive value changes in relation to time since exposure or symptoms, especially when using the results of these tests to make decisions about whether to stop using personal protective equipment or allow exposed health care workers to return to work. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 are poorly characterized, and the “window period” after acquisition in which testing is most likely to produce false-negative results is not well known. Accurate testing for SARS-CoV-2, followed by appropriate preventive measures, is paramount in the health care setting to prevent both nosocomial and community transmission. However, most hospitals are facing critical shortages of SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity, personal protective equipment, and health care personnel (1). As the epidemic progresses, hospitals increasingly have to decide how to respond when a patient or health care worker has a known exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Although 14 days of airborne precautions or quarantine would be a conservative approach to minimizing transmission per guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2), this is not feasible for many hospitals given starkly limited resources. As RT-PCR–based tests for SARS-CoV-2 are becoming more available, they are increasingly being used to “rule out” infection to conserve scarce personal protective equipment and preserve the workforce. When exposed health care workers test negative, they may be cleared to return to work; similarly, when exposed patients test negative, airborne or droplet precautions may be removed. If negative results from tests done during the window period are treated as strong evidence that an exposed person is SARS-CoV-2–negative, preventable transmission could occur. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative results from tests done early in the course of infection. The goal of our study was to estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection. As part of a broader effort to provide critical evaluation of emerging evidence, the Novel Coronavirus Research Compendium at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health did a literature review to identify preprint and peer-reviewed articles on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics (3). Investigators searched PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a strategy detailed in Supplement Table 1. The search was last updated on 15 April 2020. From the broader search, we identified articles that provided data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or exposure using samples derived from nasal or throat swabs among patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. Inclusion criteria were use of an RT-PCR–based test, sample collection from the upper respiratory tract, and reporting of time since symptom onset or exposure. We excluded articles that did not clearly define time between testing and symptom onset or exposure. We identified 7                         studies (2 preprints and 5 peer-reviewed articles) (4–10) with a total of 1330 respiratory samples analyzed by RT-PCR. Figure 1 summarizes the source data. One study by Kujawski and colleagues (10) provided both nasal and throat samples for each patient; we used only the nasal samples in our analysis.",/doi/10.7326/M20-1495

Joynt Maddox, MD, MPH, William G. Powderly, MD","In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started an epidemic in Wuhan, China, that has since spread throughout the world. Now called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. Reports from China showed that older age is a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (1). In Washington state, an initial epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States, nursing home residents were one of the most heavily affected populations and had high mortality rates, highlighting COVID-19's ability to spread rapidly in such settings (2). Other risk factors for worse outcomes include an immunocompromised state, underlying structural lung disease, cardiac disease, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes (3). Each of these comorbid conditions is common in persons receiving outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT), making this group a high-risk population. However, current payment policy under Medicare could lead to unintended consequences for patients receiving OPAT, including exposure to COVID-19. Home infusion involves the intravenous administration of medications at home. For patients to receive home infusions, several components need to be covered: the medication itself, the supplies and equipment, and the services of the home visit nurse. Many conditions require intravenous administration of medication at home, including total parenteral nutrition, intravenous antibiotics, and intravenous immunoglobulins. Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy is one of the most common home infusion services and has been used for 4 decades (4). It has been shown to be a convenient and cost-effective way to complete prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics outside the hospital (5). It and other outpatient intravenous medications can be given in various settings, including at home with the assistance of home health, at outpatient infusion centers, or at skilled-nursing facilities. Most private insurance and Medicare Advantage plans, Tricare, and many state Medicaid programs cover home infusion services, and it is the most commonly used model among these beneficiary groups as a result (6). However, the Medicare fee-for-service program does not adequately cover infusion services provided in patients' homes. Although Medicare Part A covers home nursing, it does so only for patients who are homebound, which many patients in need of home infusion services are not. Medicare Part B covers a few intravenous medications under payment rules about durable medical equipment, but these represent fewer than 10% of antimicrobials prescribed for OPAT (Table) (7). Medicare Part D, used by 70% of Medicare beneficiaries, does cover most of the drugs but not the medically necessary supplies—tubing, bags, needles, and pumps—or the administrative, pharmacy, and nursing services needed to deliver the medication (8).",/doi/10.7326/M20-1774

Some experts attribute this sequence of events to a large increase in cytokines (cytokine storm) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or a secondary infection by another organism. Objective: To report cytokine levels in multiple body fluids from a patient with COVID-19 and ARDS, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Case Report: On 20 January 2020, a 66-year-old man who had been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 developed cough and fever and treated himself at home. On 2 February, his cough and fever gradually worsened, his body temperature reached 38.7 °C, and he developed diarrhea and vomiting. He was treated at a local hospital, where his medical history included vitiligo, gastric ulcer, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He developed dyspnea 2 days later, and COVID-19 was diagnosed by a throat swab that was tested for nucleic acid. He received the antiviral drug abidol and supportive care. When his dyspnea worsened, he was transferred to the intensive care unit for noninvasive mechanical ventilation. On 11 February, mechanical ventilation was started because of a progressive decrease in blood oxygen saturation, a blood lactate level of 4 mmol/L, and a PaO2–FiO2 ratio of 186 mm Hg. On 17 February, the patient was transferred to the Severe COVID-19 Intensive Treatment Center of Heilongjiang Province. His COVID-19 status was confirmed as a critical type, according to guidelines from the National Health Commission (trial version 7). We treated him with antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin infusions, lung-protective ventilation, and lung recruitment and prone position ventilation. In addition, we started measuring levels of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in his blood daily and in his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pleural fluid intermittently, and we found high levels (Figure). On 23 February, we started continuous renal replacement therapy with an Oxiris filter (Baxter International), which is designed to adsorb uremic toxins, endotoxin, and cytokines. Computed tomography on 24 February showed worsening of pulmonary inflammation. On 1 March, we started extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because we could not                     maintain the patient's oxygenation with intermittent prone position ventilation. On 2 March, the patient developed septic shock and cardiac insufficiency, and we introduced an intra-aortic balloon pump. On 6 March, every-other-day plasmapheresis was started in another attempt to decrease his cytokine levels. Computed tomography on 9 March showed that the patient's lung consolidation had worsened. Unfortunately, the patient died on 14 March. ",/doi/10.7326/L20-0354

As of 29 April 2020, a total of 997 COVID-19 trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, of which more than 30 are investigating the effects of lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir is the main antiviral agent, whereas ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic “booster” that increases lopinavir plasma concentrations by inhibiting cytochrome 3A4 enzymes (1). The combination is an approved antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV-1 infection. However, in vitro data also suggest antiviral activity of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-1, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 4.1 µg/mL; Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, with an EC50 of 10.8 µg/mL; and, only recently, SARS-CoV-2, with an EC50 of 16.4 µg/mL (2). Importantly, the EC50 for HIV-1 is 0.07 µg/mL, more than 200-fold lower than for SARS-CoV-2 (1). Recently, Cao and colleagues published negative results of a placebo-controlled trial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in which lopinavir treatment did not affect mortality, clinical performance, or viral                     loads (3). Objective: To measure trough levels of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with COVID-19. Methods and Findings: In this series of 8 patients who were admitted to a “normal care” ward because of COVID-19, we quantified trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Patients with concomitant intake of relevant CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors were excluded. Patients were hospitalized and received 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily for 3 to 10 days before analysis, which was done in the morning shortly before the next dose. Assuming a half-life of 4 to 6 hours for lopinavir, steady-state conditions may be assumed for all patients. Analysis of trough levels was chosen because they provide more robust pharmacokinetic information for single time–point assessments and were frequently investigated in HIV trials, which makes the data comparable. Trough concentrations of lopinavir ranged from 6.2 to 24.3 µg/mL (median, 13.6 µg/mL) (Table). Interestingly, in this small sample, trough concentrations seemed to be associated with C-reactive protein (Spearman correlation coefficient rS = 0.81). All patients had an unremarkable disease course and were discharged from the normal care ward. Specific adverse effects of lopinavir and ritonavir were not observed.",/doi/10.7326/M20-1550
