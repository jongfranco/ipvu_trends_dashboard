At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)This topic will discuss the virology, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19. The management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)Issues related to COVID-19 in specific populations are discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)VIROLOGY — Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus in the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (as well as several bat coronaviruses), but in a different clade. The structure of the receptor-binding gene region is very similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and the virus has been shown to use the same receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for cell entry [4]. The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has proposed that this virus be designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [5].The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, another betacoronavirus, appears more distantly related [6,7]. The closest RNA sequence similarity is to two bat coronaviruses, and it appears likely that bats are the primary source; whether COVID-19 virus is transmitted directly from bats or through some other mechanism (eg, through an intermediate host) is unknown [8]. (See ""Coronaviruses"", section on 'Viral serotypes'.)In a phylogenetic analysis of 103 strains of SARS-CoV-2 from China, two different types of SARS-CoV-2 were identified, designated type L (accounting for 70 percent of the strains) and type S (accounting for 30 percent) [9]. The L type predominated during the early days of the epidemic in China, but accounted for a lower proportion of strains outside of Wuhan than in Wuhan. The clinical implications of these findings are uncertain. EPIDEMIOLOGYGeographic distribution — Globally, more than five million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported. Updated case counts in English can be found on the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control websites. An interactive map highlighting confirmed cases throughout the world can be found here. Since the first reports of cases from Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China, at the end of 2019, cases have been reported in all continents, except for Antarctica.In the United States, COVID-19 has been reported in all 50 states, Washington DC, and at least four territories [10]. The cumulative incidence varies by state and likely depends on a number of factors, including population density and demographics, extent of testing and reporting, and timing of mitigation strategies. In the United States, outbreaks in long-term care facilities and homeless shelters have emphasized the risk of exposure and infection in congregate settings [11-13]. (See 'Risk of transmission' below.)Transmission — Understanding of the transmission risk is incomplete. Epidemiologic investigation in Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak identified an initial association with a seafood market that sold live animals, where most patients had worked or visited and which was subsequently closed for disinfection [14]. However, as the outbreak progressed, person-to-person spread became the main mode of transmission. Person-to-personRoute of person-to-person transmission — Direct person-to-person transmission is the primary means of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is thought to occur through close-range contact, mainly via respiratory droplets; virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes; infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters). Whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the airborne route (through particles smaller than droplets that remain in the air over time and distance) under natural conditions has been a controversial issue. One letter to the editor described a study in which SARS-CoV-2 grown in tissue culture remained viable in experimentally generated aerosols for at least three hours [15]; some studies have identified viral RNA in ventilation systems and in air samples of hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19, but cultures for viable virus were not performed in these studies [16-18]. Other studies using specialized imaging to visualize respiratory exhalations have suggested that respiratory droplets may get aerosolized or carried in a gas cloud and have horizontal trajectories beyond six feet (two meters) with speaking, coughing, or sneezing [19-21]. However, the direct relevance of these findings to the epidemiology of COVID-19 and their clinical implications are unclear. Long-range airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not clearly been documented [22], and in a few reports of health care workers exposed to patients with undiagnosed infection while using only contact and droplet precautions, no secondary infections were identified despite the absence of airborne precautions [23,24]. Reflecting the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms, recommendations on airborne precautions in the health care setting vary by location; airborne precautions are universally recommended when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood, ocular secretions, and semen, but the role of these sites in transmission is uncertain [25-30]. In particular, several reports have described detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stool specimens, even after viral RNA could no longer be detected from upper respiratory specimens [28,29], and live virus has been cultured from stool in rare cases [26,31]. Although it would be difficult to confirm, fecal-oral transmission has not been clinically described, and according to a joint WHO-China report, did not appear to be a significant factor in the spread of infection [32]. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood has also been reported in some but not all studies that have tested for it [25,26,29,33]. However, the likelihood of bloodborne transmission (eg, through blood products or needlesticks) appears low; respiratory viruses are generally not transmitted through the bloodborne route, and transfusion-transmitted infection has not been reported for SARS-CoV-2 or for the related MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV [34]. (See ""Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing"", section on 'Emerging infectious disease agents'.)Viral shedding and period of infectivity — The precise interval during which an individual with COVID-19 is infectious is uncertain. It appears that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted prior to the development of symptoms and throughout the course of illness, particularly early in the course. However, most data informing this issue are from studies evaluating viral RNA detection from respiratory and other specimens; detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, and thus prolonged viral RNA detection following the resolution of illness does not necessarily indicate infectiousness. Largely indirect data suggest that infected individuals are more likely to be infectious in the earlier stages of infection. Viral RNA levels from upper respiratory specimens appear to be higher soon after symptom onset compared with later in the illness [35-39]. Additionally, in a study of nine patients with mild COVID-19, infectious virus was isolated from naso/oropharyngeal and sputum specimens during the first eight days of illness, but not after this interval, despite continued high viral RNA levels at these sites [37]. One modeling study, based on the timing of infection among 77 transmission pairs in China (with a mean serial interval of 5.8 days between the onset of symptoms in each pair) and assumptions about incubation period, suggested that infectiousness started 2.3 days prior to symptom onset, peaked 0.7 days before symptom onset, and declined within seven days; however, most patients were isolated following symptom onset, which would reduce the risk of transmission later in illness regardless of infectiousness [38]. In another study that evaluated over 2500 close contacts of 100 patients with COVID-19 in Taiwan, all of the 22 secondary cases had their first exposure to the index case within six days of symptom onset; there were no infections documented in the 850 contacts whose exposure was after this interval [40].Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or individuals within the incubation period) has also been well documented [41-46]. The biologic basis for this is supported by a study of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility, in which infectious virus was cultured from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive upper respiratory tract specimens in presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients as early as six days prior to the development of typical symptoms [47]. However, the extent to which asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission occurs and how much it contributes to the pandemic remain unknown. In an analysis of 157 locally acquired COVID-19 cases in Singapore, transmission during the incubation period was estimated to account for 6.4 percent; in such cases, the exposures occurred one to three days prior to symptom development [48]. Large-scale serologic screening may be able to provide a better sense of the scope of asymptomatic infections and inform epidemiologic analysis; several serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [49,50]. How long a person remains infectious is also uncertain, but available data suggest that prolonged viral RNA shedding after symptom resolution is not clearly associated with prolonged infectiousness. The duration of viral RNA shedding is variable; there appears to be a wide range, which may depend on severity of illness [29,37,51-53]. In one study of 21 patients with mild illness (no hypoxia), 90 percent had repeated negative viral RNA tests on nasopharyngeal swabs by 10 days after the onset of symptoms; tests were positive for longer in patients with more severe illness [51]. In contrast, in another study of 56 patients with mild to moderate illness (none required intensive care), the median duration of viral RNA shedding from naso- or oropharyngeal specimens was 24 days, and the longest was 42 days [54]. However, as mentioned above, detectable viral RNA does not always correlate with isolation of infectious virus, and there may be a threshold of viral RNA level below which infectivity is unlikely. In the study of nine patients with mild COVID-19 described above, infectious virus was not detected from respiratory specimens when the viral RNA level was <106 copies/mL [37]. According to information from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when patients continue to have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory samples following clinical recovery, by three days after recovery, the RNA concentrations are generally at or below the levels at which replication-competent virus can be reliably isolated; additionally, isolation of infectious virus from upper respiratory specimens more than nine days after illness onset has not yet been documented [55]. Infectious virus has also not been isolated from respiratory specimens of patients who have a repeat positive RNA test following clinical improvement and initial viral clearance [56]. (See 'Immunity and risk of reinfection' below.)One study reported a patient with critical COVID-19 from whom replicative virus was isolated from the stool 28 days following symptom onset; further data are needed to understand the frequency and clinical significance of this finding [31]. The relevance of viral RNA detection to duration of infection control precautions is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Risk of transmission — The risk of transmission from an individual with SARS-CoV-2 infection varies by the type and duration of exposure, use of preventive measures, and likely individual factors (eg, the amount of virus in respiratory secretions). Most secondary infections have been described among household contacts, in congregate or health care settings when personal protective equipment was not used (including hospitals [57] and long-term care facilities [11]), and in closed settings (eg, cruise ships [58]). However, reported clusters of cases after social or work gatherings also highlight the risk of transmission through close, non-household contact.Contact tracing in the early stages of epidemics at various locations suggested that most secondary infections were among household contacts, with a secondary attack rate of up to 15 percent [32,59-62]; some studies have suggested even higher household infection rates [46,63,64]. According to a joint WHO-China report, the rate of secondary COVID-19 in various locations ranged from 1 to 5 percent among tens of thousands of close contacts of confirmed patients in China; most of these occurred within households, with an in-household secondary attack rate of 3 to 10 percent [32]. In the United States, the symptomatic secondary attack rate was 0.45 percent among 445 close contacts of 10 confirmed patients; among household members, the rate was 10.5 percent [59]. In a similar study in Korea, the rates were comparable, with secondary infections in 0.55 percent of all contacts and 7.6 percent of family members [60].Clusters of cases have also been reported following family, work, or social gatherings where close, personal contact can occur [65,66]. As an example, epidemiologic analysis of a cluster of cases in the state of Illinois showed probable transmission through two family gatherings at which communal food was consumed, embraces were shared, and extended face-to-face conversations were exchanged with symptomatic individuals who were later confirmed to have COVID-19 [65]. A report of an outbreak among a choir group, with 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases identified among 61 members who attended a practice session, raised the possibility of a high transmission risk through singing in close proximity [67].The risk of transmission with more indirect contact (eg, passing someone with infection on the street, handling items that were previously handled by someone with infection) is not well established and is likely low. Environmental contamination — Virus present on contaminated surfaces may be another source of infection if susceptible individuals touch these surfaces and then transfer infectious virus to mucous membranes in the mouth, eyes, or nose. The frequency and relative importance of this type of transmission remain unclear. It may be more likely to be a potential source of infection in settings where there is heavy viral contamination (eg, in an infected individual's household or in health care settings). Extensive SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces in hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19 has been described [16,68]. In a study from Singapore, viral RNA was detected on nearly all surfaces tested (handles, light switches, bed and handrails, interior doors and windows, toilet bowl, sink basin) in the airborne infection isolation room of a patient with symptomatic mild COVID-19 prior to routine cleaning [16]. Viral RNA was not detected on similar surfaces in the rooms of two other symptomatic patients following routine cleaning (with sodium dichloroisocyanurate). Of note, viral RNA detection does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus [37]. It is unknown how long SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces [15,69,70]; other coronaviruses have been tested and may survive on inanimate surfaces for up to six to nine days without disinfection. In a study evaluating the survival of viruses dried on a plastic surface at room temperature, a specimen containing SARS-CoV (a virus closely related to SARS-CoV-2) had detectable infectivity at six but not nine days [70]. However, in a systematic review of similar studies, various disinfectants (including ethanol at concentrations between 62 and 71%) inactivated a number of coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 within one minute [69]. Based on data concerning other coronaviruses, duration of viral persistence on surfaces also likely depends on the ambient temperature, relative humidity, and the size of the initial inoculum [71].These data highlight the importance of environmental disinfection in the home and health care setting. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Environmental disinfection'.)Uncertain risk of animal contact — SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to have originally been transmitted to humans from an animal host, but the ongoing risk of transmission through animal contact is uncertain. There is no evidence suggesting animals (including domesticated animals) are a major source of infection in humans. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described in animals in both natural and experimental settings. There have been rare reports of animals with SARS-CoV-2 infection (including asymptomatic infections in dogs and symptomatic infections in cats) following close contact with a human with COVID-19 [72,73]. Moreover, asymptomatic, experimentally infected domestic cats may transmit SARS-CoV-2 to cats they are caged with [74]. The risk of infection may vary by species. In one study evaluating infection in animals after intranasal viral inoculation, SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently in ferrets and cats; viral replication was also detected in dogs, but they appeared to be less susceptible overall to experimental infection [75]. Pigs and poultry were not susceptible to infection. Given the uncertainty regarding the transmission risk and the apparent susceptibility of some animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the United States CDC recommends that pets be kept away from other animals or people outside of the household and that people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 try to avoid close contact with household pets, as they should with human household members, for the duration of their self-isolation period. There have been no reports of domesticated animals transmitting SARS-CoV-2 infection to humans. Immunity and risk of reinfection — Antibodies to the virus are induced in those who have become infected. Preliminary evidence suggests that some of these antibodies are protective, but this remains to be definitively established. Moreover, it is unknown whether all infected patients mount a protective immune response and how long any protective effect will last.Data on protective immunity following COVID-19 are emerging [36,37,76]. A case series evaluating convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 identified neutralizing activity in plasma of recovered patients that appeared to be transferred to recipients following plasma infusion [76]. Similarly, in another study of 23 patients who recovered from COVID-19, antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in most patients by 14 days following the onset of symptoms; ELISA antibody titers correlated with neutralizing activity [36]. Animal studies have suggested that the immune response to infection may offer some protection against reinfection, at least in the short term. In one study of nine rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, all animals developed neutralizing antibodies; upon rechallenge with the same viral dose 35 days later, all had anamnestic immune responses and, on nasal swab, had lower viral RNA levels and more rapid viral RNA decline compared with the initial challenge and with challenged naïve control animals [77]. Studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates in macaques have also suggested that immune responses to vaccination result in lower levels of viral RNA in respiratory tract specimens following viral challenge compared with unvaccinated controls [78,79]. Some studies have reported positive RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 following clinical improvement and negative results on two consecutive tests [80,81]. However, these positive tests occurred shortly after the negative tests, were not associated with worsening symptoms, may not represent infectious virus, and likely did not reflect reinfection. Specifically, in a report from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of patients with COVID-19 who had a repeat positive RNA test after being previously cleared from isolation, infectious virus could not be isolated in cell culture in any of the 108 patients tested [56]. Among 790 contacts, there were no newly confirmed cases that were traced to exposure during the period of the repeat positive test.As above, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization for tests that identify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum or plasma [50]. Should evidence confirm that the presence of these antibodies reflects a protective immune response, serologic screening will be an important tool to understand population immunity and distinguish individuals who are at lower risk for reinfection.CLINICAL FEATURESIncubation period — The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure [82-84].In a study of 1099 patients with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, the median incubation period was four days (interquartile range two to seven days) [83]. Using data from 181 publicly reported, confirmed cases in China with identifiable exposure, one modeling study estimated that symptoms would develop in 2.5 percent of infected individuals within 2.2 days and in 97.5 percent of infected individuals within 11.5 days [85]. The median incubation period in this study was 5.1 days.Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates — The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe [57,84,86-90]. Specifically, in a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity [91]: ●Mild (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in 81 percent.●Severe disease (eg, with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was reported in 14 percent.●Critical disease (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) was reported in 5 percent.●The overall case fatality rate was 2.3 percent; no deaths were reported among noncritical cases. Among hospitalized patients, the proportion of critical or fatal disease is higher [92-94]. In a study that included 2634 patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the New York City area, 14 percent were treated in the intensive care unit and 12 percent received invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality among those receiving mechanical ventilation was 88 percent [92]. However, the analysis was limited to patients who had either been discharged or died during the admission, and these patients represented fewer than half of the total population admitted with COVID-19; thus, the proportion of critically ill patients and the associated mortality rate may not accurately reflect those of the entire hospitalized population. The proportion of severe or fatal infections may also vary by location. According to a joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission, the case fatality rate ranged from 5.8 percent in Wuhan to 0.7 percent in the rest of China [32]. A modeling study suggested that the adjusted case fatality rate in mainland China was 1.4 percent [95]. Most of the fatal cases occurred in patients with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities [52,91]. In Italy, 12 percent of all detected COVID-19 cases and 16 percent of all hospitalized patients were admitted to the intensive care unit; the estimated case fatality rate was 7.2 percent in mid-March [96,97]. In contrast, the estimated case fatality rate in mid-March in South Korea was 0.9 percent [98]. This may be related to distinct demographics of infection; in Italy, the median age of patients with infection was 64 years, whereas in Korea the median age was in the 40s. (See 'Impact of age' below.)Risk factors for severe illness — Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but it predominantly occurs in adults with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities. The impact of age is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Impact of age' below.)Comorbidities and other conditions that have been associated with severe illness and mortality include (table 1) [52,91,99-102]: ●Cardiovascular disease●Diabetes mellitus●Hypertension●Chronic lung disease●Cancer (in particular hematologic malignancies, lung cancer, and metastatic disease) [103]●Chronic kidney disease●Obesity ●SmokingThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also includes immunocompromising conditions and liver disease as potential risk factors for severe illness [104], although specific data regarding risks associated with these conditions are limited. In a subset of 355 patients who died with COVID-19 in Italy, the mean number of pre-existing comorbidities was 2.7, and only 3 patients had no underlying condition [97]. Among patients with advanced age and medical comorbidities, COVID-19 is frequently severe. For example, in a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak across several long-term care facilities in Washington State, the median age of the 101 facility residents affected was 83 years, and 94 percent had a chronic underlying condition; the hospitalization and preliminary case fatality rates were 55 and 34 percent, respectively [105].Males have comprised a disproportionately high number of deaths in cohorts from China, Italy, and the United States [92,97,106].In a number of states in the United States, black and Latino individuals also appear to comprise a disproportionately high number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19, possibly related to underlying socioeconomic disparities [107-111]. Particular laboratory features have also been associated with worse outcomes (table 2). These include [52,112,113]: ●Lymphopenia●Elevated liver enzymes●Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)●Elevated inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein [CRP], ferritin)●Elevated D-dimer (>1 mcg/mL)●Elevated prothrombin time (PT)●Elevated troponin ●Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK)●Acute kidney injuryAs an example, in one study, progressive decline in the lymphocyte count and rise in the D-dimer over time were observed in nonsurvivors compared with more stable levels in survivors [57].Patients with severe disease have also been reported to have higher viral RNA levels in respiratory specimens than those with milder disease [51], although this association was not observed in a different study that measured viral RNA in salivary specimens [36]. Impact of age — Individuals of any age can acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, although adults of middle age and older are most commonly affected, and older adults are more likely to have severe disease. In several cohorts of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, the median age ranged from 49 to 56 years [57,87,88]. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections, 87 percent of patients were between 30 and 79 years old [91]. Similarly, in a modeling study based on data from mainland China, the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 increased with age, with a 1 percent rate for those 20 to 29 years old, 4 percent rate for those 50 to 59 years old, and 18 percent for those older than 80 years [95]. Older age is also associated with increased mortality [91,92,97]. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, case fatality rates were 8 and 15 percent among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older, respectively, in contrast to the 2.3 percent case fatality rate among the entire cohort [91]. Similar findings were reported from Italy, with case fatality rates of 12 and 20 percent among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older, respectively [97].In the United States, 2449 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 12 and March 16, 2020 had age, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) information available [114]; 67 percent of cases were diagnosed in those aged ≥45 years, and, similar to findings from China, mortality was highest among older individuals, with 80 percent of deaths occurring in those aged ≥65 years.Symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported [115-118]. Details of COVID-19 in children are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".) Asymptomatic infections — Asymptomatic infections have been well documented [84,119-125]. Their precise frequency is unknown, but several studies performed in various settings suggest that they are common. As examples:●In a COVID-19 outbreak on a cruise ship where nearly all passengers and staff were screened for SARS-CoV-2, approximately 17 percent of the population on board tested positive as of February 20; about half of the 619 confirmed COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [126]. A modeling study estimated that 18 percent were true asymptomatic cases (ie, did not go on to develop symptoms), although this was based on a number of assumptions, including the incubation period [121]. ●In a smaller COVID-19 outbreak within a skilled nursing facility, 27 of the 48 residents (56 percent) who had a positive screening test were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, but 24 of them ultimately developed symptoms over the next seven days [47]. ●Other studies have reported even higher proportions of asymptomatic cases [13,124]. As an example, in a report of a universal screening program of pregnant women presenting for delivery at two New York hospitals at the height of the pandemic there, 29 of 210 asymptomatic women without fever (14 percent) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal specimen [124]. Four additional women had fever or symptoms and also tested positive. Thus, of 33 women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 29 (88 percent) were asymptomatic on presentation.Even patients with asymptomatic infection may have objective clinical abnormalities [44,123]. As an example, in a study of 24 patients with asymptomatic infection who all underwent chest computed tomography (CT), 50 percent had typical ground-glass opacities or patchy shadowing, and another 20 percent had atypical imaging abnormalities [44]. Five patients developed low-grade fever, with or without other typical symptoms, a few days after diagnosis. In another study of 55 patients with asymptomatic infection identified through contact tracing, 67 percent had CT evidence of pneumonia on admission; only two patients developed hypoxia, and all recovered [123]. Clinical manifestationsInitial presentation — Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging [57,83,87,88]. However, other features, including upper respiratory tract symptoms, myalgias, diarrhea, and smell or taste disorders, are also common (table 3). There are no specific clinical features that can yet reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other viral respiratory infections, although development of dyspnea several days after the onset of initial symptoms is suggestive. (See 'Course and complications' below.) Most studies describing the clinical features of COVID-19 have been performed in hospitalized populations. In a study describing 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, the most common clinical features at the onset of illness were [57]:●Fever in 99 percent (note that fever on presentation is not this common in all studies; see below)●Fatigue in 70 percent●Dry cough in 59 percent●Anorexia in 40 percent●Myalgias in 35 percent●Dyspnea in 31 percent●Sputum production in 27 percentOther cohort studies of patients with confirmed COVID-19 have reported a similar range of clinical findings [57,87,127-129]. However, fever is not a universal finding on presentation. In one study, fever was reported in almost all patients, but approximately 20 percent had a very low grade fever <100.4°F/38°C [87]. In another study of 1099 patients from Wuhan and other areas in China, fever (defined as an axillary temperature over 99.5°F/37.5°C) was present in only 44 percent on admission but was ultimately noted in 89 percent during the hospitalization [83]. In a study of over 5000 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, only 31 percent had a temperature >100.4°F/38°C at presentation [92].Although not highlighted in the initial cohort studies from China, smell and taste disorders (eg, anosmia and dysgeusia) have also been reported as common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 [130-132]. In a survey of 59 patients with COVID-19 in Italy, 34 percent self-reported either a smell or taste aberration and 19 percent reported both [131]. In a survey of 202 outpatients with mild COVID-19 in Italy, 64 percent reported alterations in smell or taste, and 24 percent reported very severe alterations; smell or taste changes were reported as the only symptom in 3 percent overall and preceded symptoms in another 12 percent [133]. Whether this finding is a distinguishing feature of COVID-19 is uncertain. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea and diarrhea) have also been reported; and in some patients, they may be the presenting complaint [57,87,129,134]. In a systematic review of studies reporting on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with confirmed COVID-19, the pooled prevalence was 18 percent overall, with diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, or abdominal pain reported in 13, 10, and 9 percent, respectively [28]. Other reported symptoms have included headache, sore throat, and rhinorrhea [83,88]. Conjunctivitis has also been described [27].Dermatologic findings in patients with COVID-19 are not well characterized. There have been reports of maculopapular, urticarial, and vesicular eruptions and transient livedo reticularis [135-137]. Reddish-purple nodules on the distal digits similar in appearance to pernio (chilblains) have also been described, mainly in children and young adults with documented or suspected COVID-19, although an association has not been clearly established [137-140]. Some are calling this finding ""COVID toes.""Course and complications — As above, symptomatic infection can range from mild to critical. (See 'Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates' above.)Some patients with initially nonsevere symptoms may progress over the course of a week. In one study of 138 patients hospitalized in Wuhan for pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, dyspnea developed after a median of five days since the onset of symptoms, and hospital admission occurred after a median of seven days of symptoms [57]. In another study, the median time to dyspnea was eight days [87].Several complications of COVID-19 have been described:●Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major complication in patients with severe disease and can manifest shortly after the onset of dyspnea. In the study of 138 patients described above, ARDS developed in 20 percent a median of eight days after the onset of symptoms; mechanical ventilation was implemented in 12.3 percent [57]. In another study of 201 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, 41 percent developed ARDS; age greater than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were each associated with ARDS [112]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Clinical features in critically ill patients'.)●Other complications have included arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shock [57,106,141,142]. In one study, these were reported in 17, 7, and 9 percent, respectively [57]. In a series of 21 severely ill patients admitted to the ICU in the United States, one-third developed cardiomyopathy [141]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●Thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism and acute stroke (even in patients younger than 50 years of age without risk factors), have also been reported [143-148]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Clinical features'.)●Some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome, with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines; these laboratory abnormalities have been associated with critical and fatal illnesses [87,149,150]. (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.) ●Other inflammatory complications have been described. Guillain-Barré syndrome may occur, with onset 5 to 10 days after initial symptoms [151]. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome with clinical features similar to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome has also been described in children with COVID-19. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)●Secondary infections do not appear to be common complications of COVID-19 overall, although data are limited [152,153]. In a review of nine studies, mainly from China, the reported rate of bacterial or fungal coinfections was 8 percent (in 62 of 806); these included mainly respiratory infections and bacteremia [152]. Several reports have described presumptive invasive aspergillosis among immunocompetent patients with ARDS from COVID-19, although the frequency of this complication is uncertain [154-156].Autopsy studies have noted detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA (and, in some cases, antigen) in the kidneys, liver, heart, brain, and blood in addition to respiratory tract specimens, suggesting that the virus disseminates systemically in some cases; whether direct viral cytopathic effects at these sites contribute to the complications observed is uncertain [157,158]. According to the WHO, recovery time appears to be around two weeks for mild infections and three to six weeks for severe disease [159].Laboratory findings — Common laboratory findings among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 include lymphopenia, elevated aminotransaminase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, ferritin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) [57,83,129]. Lymphopenia is especially common, even though the total white blood cell count can vary [57,87,88,160]. As an example, in a series of 393 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City, 90 percent had a lymphocyte count <1500/microL; leukocytosis (>10,000/microL) and leukopenia (<4000/microL) were each reported in approximately 15 percent [129]. Abnormalities in coagulation testing have also been observed; these are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Coagulation abnormalities'.)On admission, many patients with pneumonia have normal serum procalcitonin levels; however, in those requiring ICU care, they are more likely to be elevated [57,87,88].Several laboratory features, including high D-dimer levels and more severe lymphopenia, have been associated with critical illness or mortality [88]. These are discussed elsewhere. (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.)Imaging findings — Chest radiographs may be normal in early or mild disease. In a retrospective study of 64 patients in Hong Kong with documented COVID-19, 20 percent did not have any abnormalities on chest radiograph at any point during the illness [161]. Common abnormal radiograph findings were consolidation and ground glass opacities, with bilateral, peripheral, and lower lung zone distributions; lung involvement increased over the course of illness, with a peak in severity at 10 to 12 days after symptom onset. Although chest CT may be more sensitive than chest radiograph and some chest CT findings may be characteristic of COVID-19, no finding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID-19. In the United States, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends not using chest CT for screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and recommends reserving it for hospitalized patients when needed for management [162]. If CT is performed, the Radiological Society of North America has categorized features as typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19, and has suggested corresponding language for the interpretation report (table 4) [163]. Chest CT in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia [128,164]. Case series have suggested that chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral, have a peripheral distribution, and involve the lower lobes. Less common findings include pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. In a study of 1014 patients in Wuhan who underwent both RT-PCR testing and chest CT for evaluation of COVID-19, a ""positive"" chest CT for COVID-19 (as determined by a consensus of two radiologists) had a sensitivity of 97 percent, using the PCR tests as a reference; however, specificity was only 25 percent [165]. The low specificity may be related to other etiologies causing similar CT findings. In another study comparing chest CTs from 219 patients with COVID-19 in China and 205 patients with other causes of viral pneumonia in the United States, COVID-19 cases were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80 versus 57 percent), ground-glass opacities (91 versus 68 percent), fine reticular opacities (56 versus 22 percent), vascular thickening (59 versus 22 percent), and reverse halo sign (11 versus 1 percent), but less likely to have a central and peripheral distribution (14 versus 35 percent), air bronchogram (14 versus 23 percent), pleural thickening (15 versus 33 percent), pleural effusion (4 versus 39 percent), and lymphadenopathy (2.7 versus 10 percent) [166]. A group of radiologists in that study was able to distinguish COVID-19 with high specificity but moderate sensitivity.As with chest radiographs, chest CT may be normal soon after the onset of symptoms, with abnormalities more likely to develop over the course of illness [127,167]. However, chest CT abnormalities have also been identified in patients prior to the development of symptoms and even prior to the detection of viral RNA from upper respiratory specimens [128,168].Among patients who clinically improve, resolution of radiographic abnormalities may lag behind improvements in fever and hypoxia [169].DIAGNOSISClinical suspicion and criteria for testing — The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with new onset fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea). It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Other consistent symptoms include myalgias, diarrhea, and smell or taste aberrancies (table 3) (see 'Initial presentation' above). Although these syndromes can occur with other viral respiratory illnesses, the likelihood of COVID-19 is increased if the patient:●Resides in or has traveled within the prior 14 days to a location where there is community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; ie, large numbers of cases that cannot be linked to specific transmission chains); in such locations, residence in congregate settings or association with events where clusters of cases have been reported is a particularly high risk for exposure. (See 'Geographic distribution' above and 'Risk of transmission' above.) or●Has had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the prior 14 days, including through work in health care settings. Close contact includes being within approximately six feet (about two meters) of the individual with COVID-19 for more than a few minutes while not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) or having direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing PPE.Patients with suspected COVID-19 who do not need emergency care should be encouraged to call prior to presenting to a health care facility for evaluation. Many patients can be evaluated regarding the need for testing over the phone. For patients in a health care facility, infection control measures should be implemented as soon as the possibility of COVID-19 is suspected. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)If possible, all symptomatic patients with suspected infection should undergo testing; the diagnosis cannot be definitively made without microbiologic testing. However, limited capacity may preclude testing all patients with suspected COVID-19. Local health departments may have specific criteria for testing. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have suggested priorities for testing (table 5); high-priority individuals include hospitalized patients (especially critically ill patients with unexplained respiratory illness) and symptomatic individuals who are health care workers or first responders, work or reside in congregate living settings, or have risk factors for severe disease [170,171]. Testing certain asymptomatic individuals may also be important for public health or infection control purposes (eg, in congregate settings where COVID-19 cases have been identified, prior to time-sensitive surgical procedures, and prior to time-sensitive aerosol-generating procedures if PPE supplies are limited, and in hospitalized patients at locations where prevalence is high [eg, ≥10 percent]). The IDSA also recommends SARS-CoV-2 testing for asymptomatic immunocompromised patients who require hospitalization and for asymptomatic individuals prior to receiving immunosuppressive therapy [172]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Pretransplantation screening'.)Testing criteria suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) can be found in its technical guidance online. These are the same criteria used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk, particularly when no other cause of the symptoms is evident. The management of suspected cases when testing is not available is discussed elsewhere. (See 'COVID-19 testing not readily available' below.)Microbiologic diagnosisNAAT (RT-PCR) to diagnose current infection — The diagnosis of COVID-19 is made by direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), primarily reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [173]. Various RT-PCR assays are used around the world; different assays amplify and detect different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Most target two or more genes, including the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and spike (S) genes, and regions in the first open reading frame, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene [174]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for many different RT-PCR assays [50]; testing is performed by the CDC, local public health departments, hospital laboratories, and certain commercial reference laboratories. These tests have different performance characteristics and times to result (ranging from 15 minutes to several hours) and require different specimen types. The turnaround time for clinicians to receive a result also depends on how often the laboratory performs the test. Point-of-care NAATs have also been developed, although some are less sensitive than laboratory-based tests [175]. Specimen collection — Upper respiratory samples are the primary specimens for SARS-CoV-2 NAAT. In the United States, the CDC recommends collection of one of the following specimens [176]:●Nasopharyngeal swab specimen, collected by a health care professional ●Oropharyngeal swab specimen, collected by a health care professional ●Nasal swab specimen from both anterior nares, collected by a health care professional or by the patient on-site or at home (in the United States, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization for home-collection testing kits that can be mailed to a laboratory for testing [177,178])●Nasal or nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate, collected by a health care professionalHowever, there is uncertainty regarding the optimal upper respiratory tract specimen. The IDSA suggests nasopharyngeal, mid-turbinate, or nasal specimens rather than an oropharyngeal specimen (or saliva) because of limited data suggesting lower sensitivity with oropharyngeal specimens and lack of data on accuracy of saliva specimens [172].Lower respiratory tract specimens are also an option for testing; the IDSA suggests reserving these for hospitalized patients who have an initial negative test on an upper respiratory tract specimen but for whom suspicion for lower respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 infection remains [172]. For lower respiratory tract specimens, expectorated sputum should be collected from patients with productive cough, and tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage should be collected from patients who are intubated. Induction of sputum is not recommended. Additional information on testing and handling of clinical specimens can be found on the CDC website. Infection control practices during specimen collection are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)Data comparing the accuracy of testing from various sites are limited but suggest that test sensitivity may vary by type of specimen. Lower respiratory tract specimens may have higher viral loads and be more likely to yield positive tests than upper respiratory tract specimens [26,33]. In a study of 205 patients with COVID-19 who were sampled at various sites, the highest rates of positive viral RNA tests were reported from bronchoalveolar lavage (95 percent, 14 of 15 specimens) and sputum (72 percent, 72 of 104 specimens), compared with oropharyngeal swab (32 percent, 126 of 398 specimens) [26]. Data from this study suggested that viral RNA levels are higher and more frequently detected in nasal compared with oral specimens, although only eight nasal swabs were tested. Similarly, in another study in which 117 pairs of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens from 12 patients were tested simultaneously, 32 pairs were discordant with one test positive and the other negative: the nasopharyngeal specimen tested positive in 66 percent of those pairs compared with 34 percent for the oropharyngeal specimen [39]. However, other studies have not identified higher viral RNA levels in nasopharyngeal compared with oropharyngeal specimens [37]. Interpretation — A positive NAAT for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, false-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been well documented. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, we suggest repeating the test. Repeat testing is performed 24 to 48 hours after the initial test. In such cases, the WHO and IDSA recommend testing a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has evidence of lower respiratory tract illness [172,179]. Infection control precautions for COVID-19 should continue while repeat evaluation is being performed. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing and concern for false-negative results, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk (residence in or travel to an area with widespread community transmission or known contact). In such cases, particularly for hospitalized patients who have a negative SARS-CoV-2 NAAT, characteristic laboratory or imaging findings can further support the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and be reasons to maintain infection control precautions. Nevertheless, other potential causes of symptoms should also be considered in patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 NAATs. The interpretation of an inconclusive or indeterminate result depends on the specific NAAT performed; the clinician should confer with the performing laboratory about additional testing.The accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 NAAT have not been systematically evaluated, and the sensitivity of testing likely depends on the precise assay, the type of specimen obtained, the quality of the specimen, and duration of illness at the time of testing. In a study of 51 patients who were hospitalized in China with fever or acute respiratory symptoms and ultimately had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test (mainly on throat swabs), 15 patients (29 percent) had a negative initial test and only were diagnosed by serial testing [180]. In a similar study of 70 patients in Singapore, initial nasopharyngeal testing was negative in 8 patients (11 percent) [181]. In both studies, rare patients were repeatedly negative and only tested positive after four or more tests.The likelihood of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA may also vary by the duration of illness [182,183]. In an analysis of seven studies (including two unpublished reports) that evaluated RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or exposure, the estimated rates of false-negative results were 100 percent on the day of exposure, 38 percent on day 5 (estimated as the first day of symptoms), 20 percent at day 8, and 66 percent at day 21 [182]. Heterogeneity across studies and assumptions made in the analysis (eg, about incubation period and time of exposure) reduce confidence in these results. One of the studies included in the analysis used a combination of RT-PCR and an immunoglobulin (Ig)M serologic test to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 and suggested that RT-PCR negative rates were <10 percent on days 1 to 3 of illness, >20 percent at day 6, and >50 percent after day 14; however, these results should also be interpreted with caution, since the serologic test used was not validated for detection of acute infection and IgM tests are frequently falsely positive [183]. Other studies have suggested that viral RNA levels are higher early in the course of infection but that some individuals have detectable viral RNA for several weeks following the onset of symptoms, as discussed elsewhere. (See 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' above.)There are also differences in the limit of detection among the major commercial laboratory RT-PCR assays, and retesting samples on different platforms may yield conflicting results [184]. Additionally, point-of-care NAAT assays may not be as sensitive as laboratory-based tests [175].Test performance by specimen type (eg, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and lower respiratory tract) is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Specimen collection' above.)Serology to identify prior infection — Serologic tests detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, and those that have been adequately validated can help identify patients who have had COVID-19. Serologic tests may also be able to identify some patients with current infection (particularly those who present late in the course of illness), but they are less likely to be reactive in the first several days to weeks of infection, and thus may have less utility for diagnosis in the acute setting [183,185-187]. Additionally, individual results should be interpreted with caution in settings of low seroprevalence, in which even serologic tests that have high specificity still have a low positive predictive value (ie, a positive test may be as likely to reflect a false positive as a true positive) [188]. In the United States, several serologic tests have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA for use by laboratories certified to perform moderate- and high-complexity tests [50]. The FDA highlights that serologic tests should not be used as the sole test to diagnose or exclude active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity and specificity of many of these serologic tests are uncertain; a catalog of these tests can be found at centerforhealthsecurity.org.Detectable antibodies generally take several days to weeks to develop. In a study of 173 patients with COVID-19, the median time from symptom onset to antibody detection (with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] that detects antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein) was 12 days for IgM and 14 days for IgG [185]. In the first week since symptom onset, fewer than 40 percent had detectable antibodies; by day 15, IgM and IgG were detectable in 94 and 80 percent, respectively. The accuracy and time to antibody detection vary with the particular test used. Studies evaluating the specificity of serologic tests in a broad population are lacking; in particular, the rate of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses is a potential concern, and IgM tests are prone to false-positive results.Large-scale serologic screening with validated tests may be able to provide a better sense of the scope of the burden of disease (by identifying people who were not diagnosed by PCR or who may have had asymptomatic or subclinical infection) and also identify individuals who may have immunity to infection; serologic correlates of protective immunity, however, have not been defined. (See 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' above and 'Immunity and risk of reinfection' above.)Other tests●Tests that identify SARS-CoV-2 antigen are under development. Rapid antigen tests are easy to use and can be performed at the point of care, but for respiratory pathogens, they are typically less sensitive than nucleic acid amplification testing (see ""Diagnosis of seasonal influenza in adults"", section on 'Rapid antigen tests'). Several manufacturers are selling rapid, point-of-care antigen tests, and in the United States, the FDA has started to issue emergency use authorizations on such tests [189]. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of false negatives with antigen tests. The WHO had previously cautioned against the use of rapid tests based on antigen testing or antibody detection that have not undergone adequate validation because of concerns regarding false-positive or false-negative results [190].●For safety reasons, specimens from a patient with suspected or documented COVID-19 should not be submitted to clinical laboratories for viral culture. Viral culture is mainly reserved for research purposes. (See 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' above.)Testing for other pathogens — If influenza is circulating in the community, it is reasonable to also test for influenza when testing for SARS-CoV-2, as this could have management implications. However, detection of another viral (or bacterial) pathogen does not necessarily rule out SARS-CoV-2 in locations where there is widespread transmission. Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, including influenza, has been described, but the reported frequency is variable [92,191-193].MANAGEMENT — Home management is appropriate for patients with mild infection (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea) or asymptomatic infection who can adequately self-isolate in the outpatient setting. Management of such patients should focus on prevention of transmission to others and monitoring for clinical deterioration, which should prompt hospitalization. Management of patients who warrant hospitalization consists of ensuring appropriate infection control and supportive care (including oxygenation and potentially ventilatory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome). Investigational approaches are also being evaluated, and should be used in the setting of a clinical trial, whenever available. Management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)PREVENTIONInfection control in the health care setting — In locations where community transmission is widespread, preventive strategies for all individuals in a health care setting are warranted to reduce potential exposures. Additional measures are warranted for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Infection control in the health care setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Personal preventive measures — If community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is present, residents should be encouraged to practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave home. In particular, individuals should avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals. The following general measures are additionally recommended to reduce transmission of infection:●Diligent hand washing, particularly after touching surfaces in public. Use of hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol is a reasonable alternative if the hands are not visibly dirty. ●Respiratory hygiene (eg, covering the cough or sneeze).●Avoiding touching the face (in particular eyes, nose, and mouth). The American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests that people not wear contact lenses, because they make people touch their eyes more frequently [194].●Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that are frequently touched. The CDC has issued guidance on disinfection in the home setting; a list of Environmental Protection Agency-registered products can be found here. These measures should be followed by all individuals, but should be emphasized for older adults and individuals with chronic medical conditions, in particular. For people without respiratory symptoms, the WHO does not recommend wearing a medical mask in the community, since it does not decrease the importance of other general measures to prevent infection and may result in unnecessary cost and supply problems; the WHO also emphasizes that medical masks should be prioritized for health care workers [195]. Recommendations on use of masks by healthy members of the community vary by country [196]. In the United States, the CDC updated its recommendations in early April to advise individuals to wear a cloth face covering (eg, homemade masks or bandanas) when in public settings where social distancing is difficult to achieve, especially in areas with substantial community transmission [197]. Individuals should be counseled to avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth when removing the covering, practice hand hygiene after handling it, and launder it routinely. Clinicians should emphasize that the face covering does not diminish the importance of other preventive measures, such as social distancing and hand hygiene. The rationale for the face covering is primarily to contain secretions of and prevent transmission from individuals who have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection. The CDC also reiterates that the face covering recommendation does not include medical masks, which should be reserved for health care workers.Individuals who are caring for patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 at home should also wear a face cover when in the same room as that patient (if the patient cannot wear a face cover). Individuals who develop an acute respiratory illness (eg, with fever and/or respiratory symptoms) should be encouraged to self-isolate at home (away from other individuals and pets in the household) for the duration of the illness and wear a face cover if they have to be around other people. Some may warrant evaluation for COVID-19. (See 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Isolation at home'.) The efficacy of masks in containing SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)The CDC has included recommended measures to prevent spread in the community on its website. Managing asymptomatic individuals with potential exposure — In areas where SARS-CoV-2 is prevalent, all residents should be encouraged to stay alert for symptoms and practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave the home. In the United States, the CDC suggests this approach for all residents [198]. For those returning from international travel (including cruise ship travel) and those who have had close contact with a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (including during the 48 hours prior to that patient developing symptoms), the CDC also suggests [198,199]:●Self-quarantine at home for 14 days following the last exposure, with maintenance of at least six feet (two meters) from others at all times. ●Avoiding contact with individuals at high risk for severe illness (unless they are household members with the same exposure). (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.)●Twice-daily temperature checks with monitoring for fever, cough, or dyspnea. If they develop such clinical manifestations, they should continue to stay at home away from other household members and contact their medical providers. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Management and counseling for all outpatients'.) For asymptomatic individuals who are critical infrastructure workers, the CDC has provided guidance on returning to work during the 14-day post-exposure period with symptom and temperature monitoring, mask use, social distancing, and workspace disinfection [200].Management of health care workers with a documented exposure is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Return to work for health care workers'.) Public health measures — On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread. Throughout the world, countries have employed various nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission. In addition to personal preventive measures (eg, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and face covers, environmental disinfection), transmission reduction strategies include: ●Social/physical distancing orders ●Stay-at-home orders●School, venue, and nonessential business closure●Bans on public gatherings●Travel restriction with exit and/or entry screening●Aggressive case identification and isolation (separating individuals with infection from others)●Contact tracing and quarantine (separating individuals who have been exposed from others)These measures have been associated with reductions in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection over time, although the relative contribution of each is difficult to assess, as most countries have employed a combination of interventions. As an example, in an epidemiologic study in Wuhan, a number of these interventions (implementation of travel restrictions in and around Wuhan with home quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing in public, followed by centralized quarantine for all cases and contacts, followed by proactive symptom screening for all residents) were associated with progressive reductions in the incidence of confirmed cases in Wuhan and a decrease in the effective reproduction number (ie, the average number of secondary cases for each case in a population made up of both susceptible and nonsusceptible individuals) from >3 prior to the interventions to 0.3 after them [201]. In another study from China, cities in which combined control measures were preemptively implemented prior to identification of COVID-19 cases recorded 33 percent fewer laboratory-confirmed cases during the first week of the outbreak compared with cities that implemented control measures later [202]. In a study from the United States evaluating incident cases in bordering counties in Illinois, which issued a stay-at-home order, and Iowa, which did not, the counties in Iowa experienced a more rapid increase in cases following implementation of the order in Illinois, estimated to result in 217 excess cases after one month [203]. For countries where incidence has declined and relaxation of transmission reduction measures is being considered, the WHO has issued interim guidance on implementation, which includes a step-wise approach that is adjusted according to local circumstances and prioritizes protecting vulnerable populations; it recommends that personal preventive measures be maintained and that public health efforts to detect cases for isolation and to identify contacts for quarantine be strengthened [204,205].Specific recommendations on global travel are available on the WHO website. In the United States, the CDC currently recommends that individuals avoid all nonessential international travel and nonessential travel from some domestic locations [206]. Because the risk of travel changes rapidly, travelers should check United States government websites for restrictions. Investigational approachesVaccines — Numerous vaccine candidates are being evaluated for prevention of COVID-19 [207]. These include various types of vaccines, including nucleic acid-based (mRNA and DNA) vaccines, viral-vector vaccines, and inactivated or recombinant protein vaccines [208]. The different vaccine platforms vary in their potential safety and immunogenicity, speed and cost of manufacturing, and other features important for meeting global demand.There is also interest in Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunization for prevention of COVID-19, and clinical trials are underway to evaluate its use among health care workers [209]. Studies have suggested that, although its primary purpose is prevention of tuberculosis, BCG immunization induces a nonspecific immune response that may have protective effects against non-mycobacterial, including viral, infections [210,211]. Any impact of BCG immunization on COVID-19 is unknown. The WHO recommends BCG vaccination not be used for prevention or lessening the severity of COVID-19, pending further data [212]. Post-exposure prophylaxis — Clinical trials are also being conducted in the United States and elsewhere to evaluate the safety and efficacy of post-exposure drug prophylaxis against COVID-19 [213,214]. No agent is known to be effective in preventing infection; we suggest post-exposure prophylaxis not be attempted outside a clinical trial. SPECIAL SITUATIONSPregnant and breastfeeding women — The general approach to prevention, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 is largely similar to that in nonpregnant individuals. Issues specific to pregnant and breastfeeding women are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".) Children — Symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported [115-118]. Details of COVID-19 in children are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".) COVID-19 testing not readily available — In some cases, testing for COVID-19 may not be accessible, particularly for individuals who have a compatible but mild illness that does not warrant hospitalization and do not have a known COVID-19 exposure or high-risk travel history. In the United States, there is limited official guidance for this situation, and the approach may depend on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the area. If the clinician has sufficient concern for possible COVID-19 (eg, there is community transmission and there is no other apparent cause for the symptoms), it is reasonable to assume the patient had COVID-19 and advise the patient to self-isolate at home (if hospitalization is not warranted) and alert the clinician about worsening symptoms. Outpatient management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Management and counseling for all outpatients' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.) SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, now designated SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan, a city in China. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Since the first reports of COVID-19, infection has spread to include more than five million confirmed cases worldwide, prompting the WHO to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms who reside in or have traveled to areas with community transmission or who have had recent close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. Clinicians should also be aware of the possibility of COVID-19 in patients with severe respiratory illness when no other etiology can be identified. Other symptoms have also been associated with COVID-19 (table 3). Limitations in testing capacity may preclude testing all patients with suspected infection; suggested priorities include hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals who are health care workers or first responders, work or reside in congregate living settings, or have risk factors for severe disease (table 5). (See 'Clinical features' above and 'Diagnosis' above.)●The microbiologic diagnosis is made by a positive nucleic acid amplification test (eg, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) for SARS-CoV-2. An upper respiratory tract specimen is the preferred initial test specimen. If possible, all symptomatic patients with suspected infection should undergo testing. However, because of limited testing capacity and concern for false-negative testing, the diagnosis is often presumptively made based on consistent clinical and epidemiologic features. Serologic tests can help identify individuals with prior infection but have less utility in the first weeks of infection. (See 'Microbiologic diagnosis' above.)●Upon suspicion of COVID-19, infection control measures should be implemented. Infection control in the home and in health care settings is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.) ●Home management is appropriate for patients with mild illness who can adequately self-isolate in the outpatient setting. A minority of patients need critical care. Home, hospital, and intensive care unit management of patients with COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, individuals should be advised to wash hands diligently, practice respiratory hygiene (eg, cover their cough), and avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals, if possible. Social distancing is recommended in locations that have community transmission. In some locations, face coverings are advised in public settings. (See 'Personal preventive measures' above.)●Interim guidance has been issued by the WHO and by the CDC. These are updated on an ongoing basis.

It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries globally. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV. The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [2].In children, COVID-19 is usually mild. However, in rare cases, children can be severely affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. In April of 2020, reports emerged from the United Kingdom of a presentation in children similar to incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) or toxic shock syndrome [3,4]. Since then, there have been increasing reports of similarly affected children in other parts of the world [5-8]. The syndrome has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C; also referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome [PMIS], pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome [PIMS], pediatric hyperinflammatory syndrome, or pediatric hyperinflammatory shock).This topic will outline what is known about the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of MIS-C. Other aspects of COVID-19 in children and adults are discussed separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)Understanding of COVID-19 and MIS-C is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the WHO and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5,9,10]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)EPIDEMIOLOGY — While the incidence of MIS-C is unknown, it appears to be a rare complication of COVID-19 in children.The initial reports of MIS-C emerged from the United Kingdom in April, 2020 [3,4]. Since then, there have been reports of similarly affected children in other parts of the world, including Europe, Canada, and the United States (the majority of cases in the United States have been in New York) [5-8,11-13].Many children with MIS-C meet criteria for complete or incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) (see 'Clinical manifestations' below). However, the epidemiology differs from that of classic KD, The pattern that has emerged from the available case series is that most MIS-C cases have occurred in older children and adolescents who were previously healthy [3,6,11]. Black children may be disproportionally affected. By contrast, classic KD typically affects infants and young children and has a higher incidence in East Asia and in children of Asian descent. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology"", section on 'Epidemiology'.)The epidemiology of MIS-C also differs from that of acute COVID-19 illness in children, which tends to be most severe in infants <1 year of age and in children with underlying health problems. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Potential risk factors for severe disease'.)The first report of MIS-C was a series of eight children seen at a tertiary center in South East England [3]. In three subsequent case series from the United Kingdom (n = 37), France (n = 35), and New York (n = 33), the majority of children were previously healthy (95 percent in the United Kingdom series, 89 percent in the French series, and 79 percent in the New York series) [11,14]. The most common comorbidities were obesity and asthma. Boys accounted for approximately 60 percent of cases. The average age was 9 to 11 years (range 1 to 17 years).It is unclear if the risk of developing MIS-C varies by race, though black children account for a disproportionally high number of cases and Asian children account for only a small number of cases in the initial reports. In the United Kingdom series, 46 percent of patients were black, 19 percent white, 11 percent Asian, and 5 percent biracial [11]. In the New York series, 24 percent were black, 27 percent Hispanic, 9 percent white, and 9 percent Asian [11].Based on the patterns seen in the United Kingdom, New York, and Italy, there seems to be a lag of several weeks between the peak of COVID-19 cases within communities to the peak of MIS-C cases [6,11,15]. For example, in London, the peak of COVID-19 cases occurred in the first to second weeks of April, while the peak of MIS-C cases occurred in the first to second week of May [11,15]. This three- to four-week lag coincides with the timing of acquired immunity and suggests that MIS-C may represent a postinfectious complication of the virus rather than acute infection, at least in some children.PATHOPHYSIOLOGY — The pathophysiology of MIS-C is not well understood. It has been suggested that the syndrome results from an abnormal immune response to the virus, with some similarities to Kawasaki disease (KD), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and cytokine release syndrome. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers the abnormal immune response are unknown. A postinfectious process is suggested, based on the timing of the rise of these cases relative to the peak of COVID-19 cases in communities, as discussed above (see 'Epidemiology' above). This is also supported by the finding that many affected children have negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 but have positive serology. However, some children do have positive PCR testing. In early case series from the United Kingdom, New York, and Italy, there were 59 children in whom both PCR and serology were performed [6,11]. Of these, 70 percent had positive serology with negative PCR, 22 percent were positive on both tests, and 8 percent were negative on both tests.Understanding the mechanisms of the exaggerated immune response in MIS-C is an area of active investigation. The pathophysiology of KD, MAS, and cytokine release syndrome are discussed separately. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology"", section on 'Immunologic response' and ""Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"", section on 'Pathophysiology' and ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"", section on 'Pathophysiology'.)CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSPresenting symptoms — In the available case reports, clinical presentations were similar, including [3,6,7,11,14]:●Persistent fevers (median duration four days) – 100 percent●Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea) – 60 to 97 percent●Rash – 50 to 60 percent●Neurocognitive symptoms (headache, lethargy, confusion) – 30 to 58 percent●Respiratory symptoms – 32 to 65 percent●Conjunctivitis – 32 percent●Mucous membrane involvement – 19 percent●Sore throat – 14 percent●Swollen hands/feet – 8 percentGastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea) were particularly common and prominent, with some children mimicking appendicitis [14,16]. Some children have been noted to have terminal ileitis on abdominal imaging and/or colitis on colonoscopy. (See 'Imaging findings' below.)Many patients presented with three to five days of fever, then went on to develop warm shock. Patients presenting with fewer days of fever have been reported. Shock is often refractory to volume resuscitation, requiring vasopressors and, in some cases, mechanical hemodynamic support.Pulmonary involvement was not a prominent feature in most cases, though many children required mechanical ventilation for cardiovascular stabilization. Respiratory symptoms (tachypnea, labored breathing), when present, were most often due to severe shock. Cough was uncommon.Clinical findings — In the available case reports, common clinical findings include [3,6,7,11,14]:●Shock – 60 to 80 percent●Criteria met for complete Kawasaki disease (KD) (table 1) – 50 to 64 percent●Myocardial dysfunction (by echocardiogram or elevated troponin/brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) – 50 to 100 percent●Acute respiratory failure requiring noninvasive or invasive ventilation – 52 to 68 percent●Acute kidney injury (most cases were mild) – 38 to 70 percent●Serositis (small pleural, pericardial, and ascitic effusions) – 24 to 50 percent●Acute hepatic failure – 21 percentLaboratory findings — Laboratory abnormalities noted in the available case series include [3,6,7,11,14,17]:●Abnormal blood cell counts, including:•Lymphocytopenia – 80 to 95 percent•Neutrophilia – 80 to 90 percent•Mild anemia – 70 percent•Thrombocytopenia – 30 to 80 percent●Elevated inflammatory markers, including:•C-reactive protein – 90 to 95 percent•Erythrocyte sedimentation rate – 80 percent•Procalcitonin•D-dimer – 80 to 95 percent•Fibrinogen – 90 percent•Ferritin – 75 percent•Interleukin-6 (IL-6)●Elevated cardiac markers:•Troponin – 60 to 90 percent•BNP or NT-pro-BNP – 90 to 100 percent●Hypoalbuminemia – 73 percent●Mildly elevated liver enzymes – 70 percent●Elevated lactate dehydrogenase – 50 to 60 percent●Hypertriglyceridemia – 70 percentImaging findings — Findings on diagnostic imaging may include [3,6,11,14]:●Echocardiography – Echocardiographic findings may include depressed left ventricular (LV) function and coronary artery (CA) abnormalities, including dilation or aneurysm, mitral valve regurgitation, and pericardial effusion [14]. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of patients have depressed LV function. CA abnormalities are seen in approximately 20 to 50 percent of patients. This is considerably higher than in classic KD, in which the rate of CA involvement is approximately 10 to 15 percent. (See ""Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation"", section on 'Coronary artery abnormalities'.)●Chest radiograph – Many patients had normal chest radiographs. Abnormal findings included small pleural effusions, patchy consolidations, focal consolidation, and atelectasis.●Computed tomography (CT) of chest – Chest CT (when obtained) generally had findings similar to those on chest radiograph. A few patients had nodular ground-glass opacification.●Abdominal imaging – Findings on abdominal ultrasound or CT included free fluid, ascites, and bowel and mesenteric inflammation including terminal ileitis, mesenteric adenopathy/adenitis, and pericholecystic edema [16].CASE DEFINITION — The criteria used for case definition vary slightly between different health agencies (table 2) [5,8,17]. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition requires that the child have severe symptoms requiring hospitalization, whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) case does not. An advantage of the WHO definition is that it provides more detail regarding clinical signs of multisystem involvement. These definitions are likely to change as more information becomes available.CDC case definition — According to the case definition put forth by the United States CDC, MIS-C is defined by meeting all of the following criteria (table 2) [5]:●Age <21 years•A presentation consistent with MIS-C, including all of the following:•Fever >38.0°C for ≥24 hours, or report of subjective fever lasting ≥24 hours•Laboratory evidence of inflammation (eg, elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, D-dimer, ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase, or interleukin-6 [IL-6] level; neutrophilia; lymphocytopenia; and/or hypoalbuminemia)•Severe illness requiring hospitalization•≥2 organ systems involved (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and/or neurologic)●No alternative plausible diagnoses●Recent or current SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure, defined as any of the following:•Positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)•Positive serology for SARS-CoV-2•Positive antigen test•COVID-19 exposure within the four weeks prior to the onset of symptomsPatients who meet these criteria and who also fulfill full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease (KD) should be considered to have MIS-C and should be reported. In addition, MIS-C should be considered in any pediatric death with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.WHO case definition — The case definition put forth by the WHO is as follows (table 2) [8]:●Age 0 to 19 years old, and●Fever for ≥3 days, and●Elevated markers of inflammation (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, or procalcitonin), and●No other obvious microbial cause of inflammation, including bacterial sepsis and staphylococcal/streptococcal shock syndromes, and●Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive reverse transcription PCR [RT-PCR], antigen test, or serology) or contact with an individual with COVID-19, and●Clinical signs of multisystem involvement (at least two of the following):•Rash, bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, or mucocutaneous inflammation signs (oral, hands, or feet)•Hypotension or shock•Cardiac dysfunction, pericarditis, valvulitis, or coronary abnormalities (including echocardiographic findings or elevated troponin/brain natriuretic peptide [BNP])•Evidence of coagulopathy (prolonged prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time; elevated D-dimer)•Acute gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain)Spectrum of disease — As more is learned about COVID-19 and MIS-C in children, it is becoming apparent that the spectrum of disease ranges from mild to severe [11]. Our understanding of the full spectrum, including subphenotypes, is evolving.●COVID-19 without an exaggerated immune response – In most children, COVID-19 causes no or only mild symptoms. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●COVID-19-associated febrile inflammatory state – Some children may present with persistent fevers and mild symptoms (eg, headache, fatigue). Inflammatory markers (especially ferritin) may be elevated, but signs of multisystem involvement are lacking.●COVID-19-associated KD – Some children meet criteria for complete or incomplete KD (table 1) and do not develop shock and multisystem involvement. It is unclear if the incidence of coronary artery (CA) aneurysms is higher in COVID-19-associated KD compared with classic KD. Further study is needed. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis"".)●COVID-19-associated MIS-C – Children with MIS-C have a more severe presentation, with markedly elevated inflammatory markers and multisystem involvement. Cardiac involvement and shock are common, as discussed above. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)It remains unclear how common each presentation is, how frequently children progress from mild to more severe manifestations, and what the risk factors are for such progression. We hope to learn more about the full spectrum of disease as additional cases are reported, and it is likely that the case definitions above (see 'Case definition' above) will change as more information becomes available.EVALUATIONLaboratory testing — The initial laboratory evaluation of a child with suspected MIS-C depends on the presentation.●Moderate to severe – For children with moderate to severe symptoms, we suggest the following:•Complete blood cell count with differential•C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (optional: procalcitonin)•Ferritin level•Liver function tests and lactate dehydrogenase•Serum electrolytes and renal function tests•Urinalysis•Coagulation studies (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer, fibrinogen, antithrombin-3)•Troponin and creatine kinase-MB•Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), or NT-pro-BNP•Cytokine panel (if available)Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, ferritin) are measured at the time of admission and then serially to monitor progression.●Well-appearing – For patients presenting with fever for ≥3 days and who are well-appearing with only mild symptoms suggestive of MIS-C, it is reasonable to perform a more limited evaluation initially. For example, it may be reasonable to start with a complete blood count and C-reactive protein and then obtain additional testing only if these are abnormal.Testing for SARS-CoV-2 — All patients with suspected MIS-C should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, including both serology and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab. As previously discussed, most affected children have positive serology with negative PCR, though some have positive PCRs (see 'Pathophysiology' above). Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Testing for other pathogens — Testing for other viral and bacterial pathogens includes [17]:●Blood culture●Urine culture●Throat culture●Stool culture●Nasopharyngeal aspirate or throat swab for respiratory viral panel●Epstein-Barr virus serology and PCR●Cytomegalovirus serology and PCR●Enterovirus PCR●Adenovirus PCRThis testing is appropriate for children with moderate to severe MIS-C (ie, children who require hospitalization). However, an extensive infectious work-up is generally not necessary in well-appearing children presenting with mild symptoms. In such patients, microbiologic testing should be done as clinically indicated according to the age of the child and his/her specific symptoms (eg, throat culture if the child has sore throat, respiratory viral panel if there are respiratory symptoms). Testing should follow the same general approach as is used for fever evaluation more broadly. (See ""Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age: Evaluation and management"".)Detection of other respiratory pathogens (eg, rhinovirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus) in nasopharyngeal specimens does not exclude COVID-19.Additional testing for other pathogens may be warranted, depending on the geographic location and exposure history. This may include:●Murine typhus●Leptospirosis serologyCardiac testing — In addition to troponin and BNP/NT-pro-BNP levels, the cardiac evaluation of a patient with suspected MIS-C includes a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography. Echocardiography is also recommended for children with documented SARS-CoV-2 who do not meet all criteria for MIS-C but who have either shock or features consistent with incomplete or complete Kawasaki disease (KD).Children and adolescents with mild COVID-19 without signs of systemic inflammation are unlikely to have coronary artery (CA) changes or myocarditis. In such children, echocardiography is generally not necessary but may be considered if there are specific clinical concerns.In children with MIS-C, baseline ECGs may be nonspecific, though arrhythmia and heart block have been described [3,18]. Findings on initial echocardiography may include CA dilation, left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, and pericardial effusion. The CA abnormalities can progress to aneurysm, including giant coronary aneurysms [3].●Echocardiographic evaluation – The echocardiographic evaluation includes the following:•Quantitative assessment of LV size and systolic function (LV end-diastolic volume, ejection fraction)•Qualitative assessment of right ventricular systolic function•CA abnormalities (dilation or aneurysm)•Assessment of valvar function•Evaluation for the presence and size of pericardial effusion•Evaluation for intracardiac thrombosis and/or pulmonary artery thrombosis, particularly apical thrombus in severe LV dysfunction•Strain imaging and LV diastolic function (optional)CA assessment is based on Z-scores, with the same classification schema used in KD (table 3), as discussed separately. (See ""Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation"", section on 'Echocardiography'.)●Timing of follow-up echocardiography – At our center, echocardiography is performed at the time of diagnosis, with follow-up examinations at the following intervals:•In patients who initially have normal function and normal CA dimensions, follow-up echocardiogram is performed one to two weeks post-diagnosis to recheck CA size.•In patients who have CA dilation/aneurysm on initial echocardiogram, echocardiography is repeated every two to three days until CA size is stable and then approximately once a week.•For patients with systolic dysfunction/myocarditis and normal CAs on initial echocardiogram, the echocardiogram is repeated as clinically indicated, including repeat imaging of the CAs with each study.•For patients who had evidence of CA involvement or systolic dysfunction/myocarditis in the acute phase, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be considered at approximately one to three months after the acute illness to assess ventricular function and evaluate for edema, diffuse fibrosis, and scar by myocardial delayed enhancement.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — In children presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with MIS-C, the differential diagnosis is broad and includes other infectious and inflammatory conditions:●Bacterial sepsis – Bacterial sepsis is an important consideration in children presenting with fever, shock, and elevated inflammatory markers. All children with suspected moderate to severe MIS-C should have blood cultures sent, and empiric antibiotics should be administered pending culture results (see 'Antibiotic therapy' below). Certain clinical features can help distinguish MIS-C from bacterial sepsis. For example, cardiac involvement, particularly coronary artery (CA) involvement, is uncommon in bacterial sepsis. Ultimately, microbiologic tests (ie, SARS-CoV-2 testing, bacterial cultures) are necessary to make the distinction. (See ""Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis in children: Definitions, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"".)●Kawasaki disease (KD) – Some children along the MIS-C spectrum meet criteria for complete or incomplete KD (table 1) (see 'Spectrum of disease' above). However, there appear to be some key differences. For example, MIS-C appears to affect older children and adolescents, whereas classic KD typically affects infants and young children. In addition, the risk of CA involvement and myocardial dysfunction may be higher in MIS-C compared with classic KD. KD shock syndrome is well described but not common in the classic KD population, whereas shock seems to be a prominent presentation in MIS-C. Ultimately, the designation of MIS-C versus KD is based on SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing (or with an exposure to an individual with COVID-19) who also fulfill full or partial criteria for KD should be considered to have MIS-C and should receive standard treatments for KD. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis"".)●Toxic shock syndrome – Staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndromes share many similarities with MIS-C (table 4). Microbiologic tests (ie, SARS-CoV-2 testing, bacterial cultures) are necessary to make the distinction. (See ""Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome"" and ""Invasive group A streptococcal infection and toxic shock syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"".)●Appendicitis – As discussed above, many children with MIS-C present with fever associated with abdominal pain and vomiting (see 'Presenting symptoms' above). This can mimic the presentation of acute appendicitis. Abdominal imaging may be necessary to make the distinction. (See 'Imaging findings' above and ""Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"".)●Other viral infections – Other viral pathogens that may manifest with multisystem involvement and/or myocarditis include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and enteroviruses. These viruses rarely cause severe multisystem disease in immunocompetent children. Serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can distinguish these from COVID-19-related MIS-C. (See ""Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection"" and ""Overview of cytomegalovirus infections in children"" and ""Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection"".)●Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) – HLH and MAS are aggressive and life-threatening conditions that have some features in common MIS-C. HLH/MAS are syndromes of excessive immune activation that can occur in previously healthy children (often triggered by an infection) and in children with underlying rheumatologic conditions. Most children with HLH/MAS are acutely ill with multiorgan involvement, cytopenias, liver function abnormalities, and neurologic symptoms. Cardiac and gastrointestinal involvement are less common, and neurologic symptoms are more prominent. The diagnosis of MAS/HLH requires specialized immunologic testing, as discussed separately. (See ""Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"", section on 'Specialized testing'.)●Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – SLE can present with fulminant multisystem illness. Such patients generally have considerable kidney and central nervous system involvement, which are not common features of MIS-C. In addition, though patients with SLE may present acutely with fulminant illness, most report feeling fatigued and unwell for an extended period of time prior to the onset of severe symptoms. This is not the case with MIS-C, in which most children are completely well prior to acute onset of febrile illness. (See ""Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"".)●Vasculitis – Other vasculitides can present with fevers, rash, and elevated inflammatory markers. Rashes seen in COVID-19-associated illness can have an appearance that can mimics vasculitis (eg, pernio [chilblain]-like lesions of acral surfaces, sometimes referred to as ""COVID toes""), but they are not vasculitic. (See ""Vasculitis in children: Evaluation overview"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cutaneous manifestations and issues related to dermatologic care"", section on 'Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19'.)MANAGEMENTSetting of care — Children with moderate to severe signs and symptoms should be admitted to the hospital. The level of care is determined by the severity of illness. Admission to a pediatric intensive care unit is appropriate for children with hemodynamic instability (shock, arrhythmia), significant respiratory compromise, or other potentially life-threatening complications. In the available case series, most patients required pediatric intensive care unit care [3,4,6,11].It may be reasonable to manage select patients with mild symptoms in the outpatient setting. However, given the uncertainty regarding the risk of progression from mild to severe (see 'Spectrum of disease' above), hospital admission is advised for patients who have markedly elevated inflammatory markers so that levels can be monitored until trending down.For children who are managed in the outpatient setting, it is critical to provide instructions for when to seek care and to ensure appropriate follow-up. Most children should have follow-up within 48 hours if persistently febrile. Follow-up should include clinical assessment and repeat laboratory testing.Multidisciplinary care — By definition, MIS-C is a multisystem disease, and care for affected children requires coordination of many different specialties. This may include:●Pediatric infectious disease specialists●Pediatric rheumatologists●Pediatric cardiologists●Pediatric intensivists●Pediatric hematologistsAntimicrobial therapyAntibiotic therapy — MIS-C can present with signs and symptoms that mimic those of septic shock and toxic shock syndrome. Thus, patients presenting with severe multisystem involvement, particularly those with shock, should receive prompt empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy pending culture results. An appropriate empiric regimen consists of ceftriaxone plus vancomycin. Ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam is an alternative regimen, particularly for children with acute kidney injury. Clindamycin is added if there are features consistent with toxin-mediated illness (eg, erythroderma). Antibiotics should be discontinued once bacterial infection has been excluded if the child's clinical status has stabilized. (See ""Septic shock in children: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)"", section on 'Empiric regimens' and ""Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome"", section on 'Empiric therapy'.)Antiviral therapy — The role of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapies (eg, remdesivir) in the management of MIS-C is uncertain. Many patients are polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for SARS-CoV-2, and MIS-C may represent a postinfectious complication rather than active infection (see 'Pathophysiology' above). However, some children do have positive PCR testing and may have current infection. Thus, antiviral therapy may have potential to impact the disease process in some, but not all, patients. Use of antiviral agents is generally limited to children with severe MIS-C manifestations. We advise consultation with an infectious disease specialist to guide decision-making. Choice of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agent, dosing, side effects, and monitoring are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Antiviral therapy for select patients'.)Additional therapy based on presentation — Additional therapy depends on the clinical presentation. These presentations can overlap, and it may be appropriate to provide interventions from more than one category. For example, patients presenting with Kawasaki disease (KD) with associated warm shock should receive treatment for KD (ie intravenous immune globulin [IVIG] and aspirin) and appropriate hemodynamic support (ie, volume expansion and epinephrine).Shock — Children presenting with shock should be resuscitated according to standard protocols (algorithm 1). In the available case series, most children with MIS-C presented with warm shock that was refractory to volume expansion. Epinephrine is the preferred vasoactive agent for the management of warm shock in children. In children presenting with significant ventricular dysfunction, milrinone may be helpful. Management of shock in pediatric patients is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Initial management of shock in children"".)Features of Kawasaki disease — Patients who meet criteria for incomplete or complete KD (table 1) should receive standard therapies for KD, including IVIG, aspirin, and, if there are persistent signs of inflammation or coronary artery (CA) dilation/aneurysm, glucocorticoids. Treatment of KD is summarized in the figure (algorithm 2) and is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis"" and ""Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease"".)Myocardial dysfunction — During the acute inflammatory phase of illness, children with myocardial dysfunction may present with arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise. Serial echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function and monitoring of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin levels can help guide therapy. Management focuses on supportive care to maintain hemodynamic stability and ensure adequate systemic perfusion. IVIG is often used in severe cases when the clinical picture is consistent with myocarditis, though conclusive evidence of benefit is lacking. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential so that arrhythmias are promptly detected and treated. Patients with significant ventricular dysfunction are treated with intravenous diuretics and inotropic agents, such as milrinone, dopamine, and dobutamine. In cases of fulminant disease, mechanical hemodynamic support may be necessary in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or a ventricular assist device. Management of myocarditis is discussed separately. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in children"".)Thrombotic complications — Patients with MIS-C are at risk of experiencing thrombotic complications. For example, patients with KD who have large or giant CA aneurysms are at risk for myocardial infarction. In addition, patients may be at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolus, due to hypercoagulability associated with COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●Patients with features of KD – All patients who meet criteria for complete or incomplete KD should receive antithrombotic therapy, which, at a minimum, includes low-dose aspirin. Additional antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy may be warranted in select patients, depending on the degree of CA dilation, as summarized in the figure (algorithm 3) and discussed separately. (See ""Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Management and prognosis"", section on 'Prevention of coronary thrombosis'.)●Patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction – Systemic anticoagulation may be appropriate for patients with moderate to severe LV dysfunction, as discussed separately. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in children"", section on 'Anticoagulation'.)●Other patients – In patients without KD or significant LV dysfunction, the decision to initiate therapy for prevention of VTE is individualized. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related MIS-C itself should be considered a major risk factor for VTE. VTE prophylaxis is generally appropriate for older children and adolescents hospitalized with moderate to severe MIS-C, provided that bleeding risk is low. In infants and young children, the decision is made on a case-by-case basis, weighing other VTE risk factors and the patient's bleeding risk. When VTE prophylaxis is used, low molecular weight heparin is generally the preferred agent. Nonpharmacologic strategies for VTE prophylaxis (eg, intermittent pneumatic compression devices [size permitting] and early mobilization) are encouraged, but MIS-C-related coagulopathy may merit a higher level of intervention. The approach to VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized children is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism in children: Treatment, prevention, and outcome"", section on 'Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis'.)Adjunctive immune-modifying therapies — The benefits and risks of adjunctive therapies (glucocorticoids, interleukin-1 [IL-1] inhibitors [eg, anakinra, canakinumab], IL-6 inhibitors [eg, tocilizumab], convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients) are uncertain. Consultation with pediatric infectious disease and rheumatology specialists is advised. We make decisions about the use of adjunctive therapies on a case-by-case basis, according to disease severity and markers of inflammation or active SARS-CoV-2 infection.As discussed above, glucocorticoids are appropriate for patients with features of KD who have persistent fever after IVIG or CA dilation/aneurysm (see 'Features of Kawasaki disease' above). In addition, glucocorticoids can be considered for patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS; also called cytokine storm, which is characterized by persistent fever, markedly elevated inflammatory markers [eg, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin] and elevated proinflammatory cytokines [eg, IL-6]). Anakinra, canakinumab, and tocilizumab are alternative options for treatment of CRS in patients who cannot receive glucocorticoids and those who are refractory to glucocorticoids. Such decisions should be made under the direction of a pediatric rheumatologist and should occur in the context of a clinical trial whenever possible. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Others'.)OUTCOME — The prognosis of MIS-C is uncertain, given that it is a new clinical entity and our understanding of the disease is still evolving. Though MIS-C has many similarities to Kawasaki disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome, it is clear that the disease course in MIS-C can be more severe, with most children requiring intensive care interventions. Most children survive, but there have been several deaths reported [3,5,7]. Of the approximately 230 cases of suspected MIS-C reported by mid-May of 2020, there were at least five deaths [7].CASE REPORTING — Health care providers who have cared or are caring for patients younger than 21 years of age meeting MIS-C criteria (table 2) should report suspected cases to their local, state, or territorial health department. Additional information can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website and the World Health Organization (WHO) website.SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately:●(See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)●(See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"".)●(See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)●(See ""Society guideline links: Kawasaki disease"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or email these topics to your patients.

However, in rare cases, children can be severely affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. In April of 2020, reports emerged of a presentation in children similar to Kawasaki disease (KD) or toxic shock syndrome. Since then, there have been increasing reports of similarly affected children around the world. The syndrome has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). (See 'Introduction' above.)●The clinical presentation of MIS-C may include persistent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea), rash, and conjunctivitis. Patients typically present with three to five days of fever, followed by development of shock. Laboratory findings include lymphocytopenia, elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, D-dimer), and elevated cardiac markers (troponin, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]). (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)●Case definitions for MIS-C are summarized in the table (table 2). There appears to be a spectrum of disease. (See 'Case definition' above and 'Spectrum of disease' above.)●The initial evaluation of a child with suspected MIS-C generally includes the following, though a more limited evaluation may be appropriate for children with mild presentations (see 'Evaluation' above):•Laboratory testing:-Complete blood cell count with differential-C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (optional: procalcitonin)-Ferritin level-Liver function tests and lactate dehydrogenase-Serum electrolytes and renal function tests-Coagulation studies (activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio/prothrombin time, D-dimer, fibrinogen, antithrombin-3)-Troponin-BNP-Blood culture-Cytokine panel (if available)•Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including both serology and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis')•Testing for other viral and bacterial pathogens (see 'Testing for other pathogens' above)•Cardiac evaluation including 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography (see 'Cardiac testing' above)●Management of MIS-C includes the following (see 'Management' above):•Multidisciplinary care – By definition, MIS-C is a multisystem disease, and care for affected children requires coordination of many different specialties.

Addressing these issues is necessary, yet also challenging, because there are few direct data on which to base recommendations [1].This topic will discuss issues related to dermatologic care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other relevant aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and patient management are discussed in detail separately.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Care of patients with systemic rheumatic disease during the pandemic"".)CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF COVID-19 — Case series from around the world have identified a range of potential dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 [2,3]. The frequency (ranging from 0.2 to 20.4 percent of cases) and timing of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are difficult to ascertain [4-6]. Also unclear is the association of certain skin manifestations with the illness severity [7]. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that in some patients the observed skin findings may represent cutaneous reactions to the numerous treatments used for COVID-19 [7,8].The American Academy of Dermatology's COVID-19 Registry, a collaboration between the American Academy of Dermatology and the International League of Dermatologic Societies, is attempting to collate cases and better define the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 [9]. (See 'Registries' below.)Reported dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 include:●Exanthematous (morbilliform) rash – In several case series, a morbilliform rash predominantly involving the trunk has been reported as the most common cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 [2,3,5,10,11]. The rash has been noted either at the disease onset or, more frequently, after hospital discharge or recovery [5].●Pernio (chilblain)-like acral lesions – Pernio (chilblain)-like lesions of acral surfaces (""COVID toes"") have been described across the age spectrum in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, in the absence of cold exposure or underlying conditions associated with pernio [2,3,12-17]. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of these lesions is still under evolution, though it appears to be a primarily inflammatory process [3,15,17,18]. They present as erythematous-violaceous or purpuric macules on fingers, elbows, toes, and lateral aspect of the feet, with or without accompanying edema and pruritus. Resolution may occur in two to eight weeks.Patients presenting with new-onset, pernio-like lesions that have no other clear cause should be tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For patients that have had these lesions for >4 weeks, immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing may be appropriate, following local guidelines and depending on the quality of available tests. Work-up of other causes of pernio is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Pernio (chilblains)"".)There are no treatment guidelines for COVID-19-associated, pernio-like lesions of the feet or hands. However, high-potency topical corticosteroids may be helpful if the lesions are causing discomfort.●Livedo-like/retiform purpura/necrotic vascular lesions – Livedo reticularis, retiform purpura, and livedoid lesions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 [13,19-22]. Retiform purpura and necrotic vascular lesions have been described in three patients with severe pulmonary disease [21]. Histologic and immunohistochemistry studies of skin biopsies revealed a pattern of complement-mediated microvascular injury in both involved and normally appearing skin. Histopathologic findings of thrombotic vasculopathy and/or laboratory coagulation alterations have been demonstrated in patients with severe COVID-19 and acral, ischemic lesions [18,22]. (See ""Approach to the patient with retiform (angulated) purpura"" and ""Livedoid vasculopathy"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●Urticaria – Acute urticaria with or without concomitant fever has been reported as a presenting sign of COVID-19 infection [2,3,5,13,23].●Vesicular (varicella-like) eruptions – There are several reports describing a vesicular-pustular, varicella-like eruption associated with COVID-19 [2,13,24,25]. In a series of 24 patients, an eruption of small papules, vesicles, and pustules appeared 4 to 30 days after the onset of COVID symptoms and resolved in a median of 10 days [26]. A real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from vesicle content performed in four patients yielded negative results. Seventeen of 24 patients were not taking any medications, ruling out a drug reaction.●Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) – An erythematous, polymorphic rash, erythema and/or firm induration of hands and feet, oral mucositis, and conjunctivitis, along with systemic, laboratory, and imaging findings of atypical, severe Kawasaki disease, have been described in a cohort of 10 Italian children during the COVID-19 pandemic [27]. Similar cases have been reported in the United Kingdom [28], the United States, and other countries. Case definitions for MIS-C have been proposed by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology"", section on 'Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children'.)Less frequently reported dermatologic manifestations include papulosquamous eruptions [29], erythema multiforme-like lesions [30,31], dengue-like rashes [32,33], petechiae [34], and gangrene [35].Some infants born to mothers with COVID-19 at birth have had transient rash. In a review of nine small case series from China that included a total of 65 pregnant women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and 67 newborns, two newborns presented with a rash [36]. The rash has been described in one infant as a diffuse, maculopapular eruption that resolved in one day with desquamation and in another as a diffuse, red, miliaria-like eruption that disappeared in 10 days without treatment [37].DERMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS RELATED TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC — Skin injury, mechanical/friction dermatitis, and irritant contact dermatitis due to personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene measures have been reported in the majority of health care workers involved in the direct care of patients with COVID-19 [38].Personal protective equipment-induced skin injury — Health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients or patients potentially infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may spend long hours wearing PPE. The American Academy of Dermatology has released recommendations on preventing and treating occupationally induced dermatologic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.PPE-induced skin injury is common, occurring in 43 to 97 percent of Chinese health care workers [38-40]. Long durations of PPE use (>6 hours per day) increase rates of skin damage [38,39]. Masks, goggles, face shields, and gloves apply pressure, create abrasion, and retain moisture and can injure the nasal bridge, cheek, forehead, and hands [38-40].PPE-induced injuries include desquamation, erythema, maceration, fissuring, papules, and erosions, leading to itching and pain [39]. PPE use can also aggravate underlying skin conditions [41].Prevention of PPE-related injuries has the potential to reduce PPE protocol breaches due to inadvertent adjustment and touching [42]. The use of barrier films or dressings at pressure points before donning PPE may reduce these types of injuries [41,43-46]. However, the effect of these preventive measures on PPE ability to prevent viral spread are not well characterized, and caution is warranted [42,44]. Hand hygiene-related dermatitis — Hand hygiene is considered a key tool against COVID-19. Hand eczema was already an issue among health care workers and is likely to be an even greater problem with higher rates of hand washing and glove use during the pandemic [47].The frequency of irritant contact dermatitis of the hands may be reduced by frequent usage of emollients, washing with lukewarm water instead of hot water, and usage of alcohol-based cleansers when hands are not visibly dirty [41,45,48,49]. Overzealous hand hygiene may cause hand eczema in the general population as well [50].The American Academy of Dermatology has released recommendations on preventing and treating occupationally induced dermatologic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. (See ""Irritant contact dermatitis in adults"" and ""Chronic hand eczema"".)THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC — The COVID-19 pandemic has led to necessary adjustments to the therapeutic approach for some dermatologic diseases. Considerations for immunosuppressive therapy, phototherapy, and skin cancer treatment are reviewed here. Various professional organizations have also released guidelines for clinical care during the pandemic. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Dermatology'.)Use of biologic and other immunosuppressive therapies — Biologic and immunosuppressive therapies play important roles in the management of a wide variety of dermatologic diseases, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and other inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. The risks of these immunomodulatory therapies in relation to COVID-19 remain unclear. Although it is generally accepted that most patients without COVID-19 who are already taking immunosuppressive drugs for dermatologic disease can continue therapy, a more cautious approach is typically taken for patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and patients who are considering starting a new immunosuppressive therapy. (See 'Patients without COVID-19' below and 'Patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19' below.)Assessment of risk — The uncertainty regarding the impact of biologic and other immunosuppressive therapies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection risk and COVID-19 severity makes risk assessment challenging [51-53]. Specific challenges for risk assessment include the paucity of data, the various mechanisms of action of immunosuppressive drugs, and the need to consider patient-specific and disease-specific morbidity and comorbidities. Some authors have proposed that the broad immunosuppression induced by small molecule immunosuppressants (eg, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine) may be of greater concern than the targeted immunosuppression induced by biologic drugs; however, the relative safety of individual immunosuppressants remains unclear [54].Consideration of the potential risks of immunosuppressive therapy must also be balanced with consideration of the detrimental effects on skin disease and associated conditions that may result from cessation of effective therapies [55]. Cutaneous disease may flare, and occasional patients may not achieve the same level of response upon the reintroduction of a previously effective biologic therapy [52,53]. Of note, the long half-lives of some biologic agents mean that immunosuppressive effects of concern may still persist for some time following the decision to stop therapy.Studies evaluating use of immunomodulatory therapies in relation to COVID-19 in patients with dermatologic disease are limited and insufficient for drawing conclusions on risk in this population [56-58]. It is unclear whether data from clinical trials that have assessed risk for upper respiratory infections during biologic therapy for dermatologic disease are applicable to SARS-CoV-2 infection [53,59-61].In support of the theory that risks of continuing biologic therapy for skin disease may be low, one retrospective study of 5206 patients in northern Italy treated with biologic agents for plaque psoriasis between February 20 and April 1, 2020, found no COVID-19-related deaths and only four COVID-19-related hospitalizations [56]. In addition, a case control study performed in the Lombardy region of Italy that involved assessment of 1193 patients with psoriasis treated with biologic or small molecule therapy and approximately 10 million controls between February 21 and April 9, 2020, found higher risks for testing positive for COVID-19, being self-quarantined at home due to COVID-19, or being hospitalized due to COVID-19 among psoriasis patients receiving biologic therapy compared with controls but did not find statistically significant increases in risk for intensive care unit admission or dying in this population [57].Although the potential for a beneficial effect of biologic inhibitors tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or interleukin (IL) 17 in COVID-19 has been proposed based upon the theory that some immunosuppressive drugs might have inhibitory effects on damaging immune response that is thought to contribute to organ damage in COVID-19, this has not been proven [62-65]. Data on IL-6 pathway inhibitors is reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)Patients without COVID-19 — Decisions on the use of immunosuppressive therapies in patients without signs or symptoms of COVID-19 during the global pandemic should be made on a case-by-case basis and in conjunction with the patient. This may involve review of the patient's comorbidities, severity of the disease originally being treated, limited available data, expert opinion, local recommendations, and patient preference.Continuation of immunosuppressive therapies — Based upon an absence of evidence that suggests benefit of discontinuing immunosuppressive therapies in patients without COVID-19 and the potential detrimental effects of discontinuing effective therapies, the continuation of biologic and small molecule immunosuppressants for dermatologic disease is generally considered a safe and appropriate option for patients who do not have suspected or documented COVID-19. Examples of societies that support this approach include the American Academy of Dermatology [66], National Psoriasis Foundation [67], International Psoriasis Council [68], British Academy of Dermatology [69], and International League of Dermatological Societies [70].Initiation of immunosuppressive therapies — Routine avoidance of initiating a new immunosuppressive therapy for dermatologic disease in patients without COVID-19 is not considered necessary. However, given that some uncertainty remains regarding the effects of immunosuppressive therapies on COVID-19, the decision to start a new immunosuppressive drug for dermatologic disease should be taken carefully, involving a case-specific review of the potential risks and benefits of therapy. In particular, for patients perceived to be at increased risk for severe COVID-19, it may be prudent to consider deferring immunosuppressive treatments in favor of other therapies [66]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)Some authors have proposed testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection or immunity prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapies [71]. However, the value of this approach is unclear.Patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 — Active infection is an accepted indication for discontinuation and avoidance of initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. Some professional societies, including the American Academy of Dermatology, have issued statements that recommend discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs in patients who develop COVID-19, although this remains an area of debate [72]. This approach may be the appropriate default for most patients with confirmed COVID-19. Immunosuppressive therapy may be resumed, if needed, following complete recovery from COVID-19.However, given the uncertainty about the effects of various immunosuppressants on the course of COVID-19, the decision to discontinue treatment in a patient with COVID-19 should be made on a case-by-case basis. Other factors that may influence the decision to cease treatment may include the severity of COVID-19, the potential that biologic treatment may reduce risk of cytokine storm, and the potential negative ramifications of treatment cessation on flaring immunologic activity, including both dermatologic disease and comorbidities.Phototherapy — In-office phototherapy typically involves frequent clinic visits, potentially increasing exposure of patients and clinical staff to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the risks and benefits of office-based phototherapy should be weighed carefully for individual patients. Home phototherapy is an alternative that may be the preferred method of phototherapy during the pandemic but may not be feasible for all patients. If in-office phototherapy is necessary, careful precautions, including screening for symptoms, limiting visitors, personal protective equipment (PPE) use, and equipment disinfection, should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of infection [73,74]. Alternatives to phototherapy should also be considered. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Skin cancer — Many full body skin examinations, biopsies, and skin cancer excisions are being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Triage and management strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic for melanoma, advanced squamous cell carcinoma, and advanced basal cell carcinoma have been developed by several groups, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the European Society for Medical Oncology, and the American College of Mohs Surgery, with deferment of surgery or prompt surgery dependent upon the type of lesion and reason for the visit [75-77]. The United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium has published recommendations for the treatment of cutaneous lymphomas during the COVID-19 pandemic [78].For patients with advanced melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers who are under treatment, there are no recommendations to cease skin cancer-related systemic therapies [79,80]. However, the decision regarding the continuation or initiation of systemic targeted therapies or immunotherapies must be made on a case-by-case basis, after careful evaluation of benefits versus risks.General and specific issues related to the care of cancer patients during the pandemic are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)DELIVERY OF CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC — Local guidelines on the performance of routine, nonurgent medical care during the pandemic differ and continue to evolve. In many settings, the pandemic has led to increased use of telemedicine for dermatologic care (ie, teledermatology). In scenarios in which in-person care remains necessary or appropriate, precautions to limit risk for transmission of infection are indicated. (See 'Telemedicine' below and 'In-person care' below and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Dermatology'.)Telemedicine — Telemedicine provides an opportunity to provide care while reducing risk for exposure of clinicians, staff, and patients to individuals with COVID-19 [81,82]. Both synchronous (eg, simultaneous, two-way communication between the patient and clinician via telephone or videoconferencing) and asynchronous (eg, store-and-forward transmission of images for later assessment by the clinician) modalities have been utilized for teledermatology care [83]. A structured triage process may be helpful for identifying patients who require in-person, rather than a telemedicine, visit [84,85]. Telemedicine may also be an appropriate option for inpatient dermatologic care in some scenarios. The Society of Dermatology Hospitalists has produced an algorithm to guide triaging of consultations and the performance of safe inpatient dermatologic care [86]. Concerns have been raised over privacy and security of telemedicine [87,88]. The platform selected should be compliant with local privacy regulations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some regulatory bodies have relaxed or waived rules to allow more flexibility in telemedicine [89].In-person care — In-person visits should be performed with appropriate infection control precautions. This typically includes at least patient screening and use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) [90-92]. Best practices for infection control in the clinical setting are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Although the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through procedures such as dermoscopy remains unclear, clinicians should be cognizant about the potential for transmission through equipment that may come into contact with multiple patients. In regards to dermoscopy, noncontact dermoscopy is the preferred form of dermoscopy during the pandemic. Examples of additional suggestions for reducing risk for disease transmission through dermoscopy have included disinfection of the dermatoscope with alcohol for at least one minute prior to and following examination, use of polyvinyl chloride food wrap or glass slide between the lens and lesion, use of alcohol gel as an interface medium, and use of disposable dermoscopic lens covers [93-95].REGISTRIES — Multiple registries have been developed, with the goal of increasing knowledge of the dermatologic manifestations and impact of COVID-19 in patients with dermatologic disease. Examples include:●General dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 or patients with any pre-existing dermatologic condition:•American Academy of Dermatology/International League of Dermatological Societies COVID-19 Registry●Psoriasis:•Psoriasis Registry for Outcomes, Therapy, and Epidemiology of COVID-19 Infection (PsoPROTECT)•Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Under Research Exclusion Registry (SECURE-Psoriasis Registry)●Atopic dermatitis:•Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Under Research Exclusion Registry (SECURE-AD Registry)●Alopecia:•Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Under Research Exclusion Registry (SECURE-Alopecia Registry)●Hidradenitis suppurativa:•Global Hidradenitis Suppurativa COIVD-19 Registry●Acral changes in the pediatric population:•COVID Acral Ischemia/Perniosis in Children RegistryDisease registries for rheumatologic diseases are reviewed separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Multiple skin manifestations have been described in patients with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These include a morbilliform rash; urticaria; pernio-like, acral lesions; livedo-like, vascular lesions; and vesicular, varicella-like eruptions. A severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome with mucocutaneous, systemic, laboratory, and imaging findings of atypical, severe Kawasaki disease has also been reported in children and adolescents with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). (See 'Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19' above.)●Skin injury, mechanical/friction dermatitis, and hand irritant contact dermatitis due to personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene measures have been reported in the majority of health care workers involved in the care of patients with COVID-19. Use of barrier films or dressings at pressure points of PPE and frequent use of emollients after hand washing may help reduce skin damage and irritation. (See 'Dermatologic conditions related to COVID-19 pandemic' above.)●The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the need to adjust aspects of dermatologic care. Examples include adjustments in the approach to immunosuppressive treatment, phototherapy, skin cancer treatment, and routine clinical care. (See 'Therapeutic considerations during the pandemic' above and 'Delivery of care during the pandemic' above.)●The impact of immunosuppressive therapies for dermatologic disease on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk for complications of COVID-19 is unclear. The decision to continue or start immunosuppressive therapy for dermatologic disease during the pandemic should be made on a case-by-case basis. Examples of important factors to consider include the patient's infection status, the immunosuppressant under consideration, and the impact of treatment cessation on the dermatologic disease and comorbidities. (See 'Therapeutic considerations during the pandemic' above.)●Given the absence of evidence indicating benefit of discontinuing immunosuppressive therapies in patients without COVID-19, continuation of immunosuppressive therapy for dermatologic disease is considered a safe and appropriate option for this population. The decision to start a new immunosuppressive drug should include careful consideration of potential risks and benefits of therapy. For patients with risk for severe COVID-19, it may be appropriate to defer immunosuppressive treatments in favor of other therapies. (See 'Patients without COVID-19' above.)●Active infection is an accepted indication for discontinuation and avoidance of initiation of immunosuppressive therapies, and some professional organizations, including the American Academy of Dermatology, have issued statements recommending discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs for cutaneous disease in patients who develop COVID-19. Given the paucity of evidence on risks and benefits of discontinuation, the decision to continue or discontinue immunosuppressive treatment in patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 may be made on a case-by-case basis. If discontinued, immunosuppressive therapies may be resumed upon complete recovery form COVID-19. (See 'Patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19' above.)●The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased use of telemedicine for routine clinical care. When in-person visits are performed, appropriate infection control precautions should be implemented.

ID:127965,medical,medical_review,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to gastrointestinal disease in adults,/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-issues-related-to-gastrointestinal-disease-in-adults?search=covid+19&source=search_result&selectedTitle=4%7E150&usage_type=default,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily manifests as a lung infection with symptoms ranging from those of a mild upper respiratory infection to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. COVID-19 disproportionately affects patients with pre-existing comorbidities and/or older adults. All medical professionals, including gastroenterology and hepatology clinicians, are tasked with rapidly adjusting their practice to curtail the spread of COVID-19, while providing care to their patients.This topic will discuss COVID-19-related issues for patients with gastrointestinal and liver disease. As understanding of COVID-19 illness continues to evolve, the approach to diagnosis and management may require modification as well. Other important aspects of COVID-19 infection are discussed in detail separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".) ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)POSSIBLE RISK FACTORS FOR COVID-19 — Some patients with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) or liver disease may be at increased risk for COVID-19 and for more severe illness. Potential risk factors in these patients include their chronic inflammatory disease, comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus), immune-modifying therapies, and the need for regular office, endoscopy center, or laboratory visits. These patient groups include [1]:●Patients with cirrhosis●Patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease (eg, primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis)●Liver transplantation recipients [2] (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"")For patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), preliminary data have suggested that the prevalence of COVID-19 is not higher than that of the general population [3-6]. The risk of COVID-19 for patients on biologic therapy for chronic inflammatory diseases (eg, IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis) is uncertain [5]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)The gastrointestinal tract may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection because of widely expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the intestine [7]. ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus, and digestive symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by direct viral attack as well as tissue and organ damage due to the immune response [8,9]. Staining of tissue specimens from patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that the positive areas were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of gastric and intestinal epithelial cells and the cilia of glandular epithelial cells [8]. In addition, viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in the cytoplasm of gastric, duodenal, and rectal glandular epithelial cells. However, understanding of the pathogenesis of digestive disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving, and its effects on existing chronic GI disorders remains uncertain [10].CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTINGSymptoms of disease flare that can mimic COVID-19 — The clinical presentation of several gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases (eg, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hepatitis) can mimic COVID-19 infection [11]. Examples include diseases that manifest with diarrhea, anorexia, and acute hepatitis and/or abnormal liver biochemical and function tests [12]. Thus, for patients with an existing diagnosis of chronic GI or liver disease, the clinician will need to assess whether symptoms are related to a disease flare or COVID-19. The approach to testing for COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Digestive symptoms — Patients with COVID-19 typically present with fever and respiratory symptoms; however, gastrointestinal symptoms have been commonly reported in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 [7,12-15]. For example, in a study including 318 adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, 195 patients (61 percent) reported at least one digestive symptom, and the most frequently reported symptoms were anorexia in 110 patients (35 percent), diarrhea in 107 patients (34 percent), and nausea in 84 patients (26 percent) [13]. Similarly, in another study of 204 patients with COVID-19, 103 patients (51 percent) reported at least one digestive symptom, and the most commonly reported symptoms were anorexia and diarrhea [12]. Some patients with COVID-19 have presented with isolated GI symptoms that may precede the development of respiratory symptoms [16,17]. As an example, in a study of 1141 patients with COVID-19, 183 patients (16 percent) presented with GI symptoms (eg, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) in the absence of respiratory complaints [16]. Limited data have suggested that diarrheal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 have been associated with virus RNA in stool [14,18,19]. In a study of 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, stool samples from patients with diarrhea had higher rates for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA by real time polymerase chain reaction compared with patients without diarrhea (69 versus 17 percent) [18]. Hepatic manifestations — The clinical presentation of COVID-19 may include hepatic manifestations such as acute hepatitis and abnormal liver biochemical and function tests [20]. When to test for COVID-19 in patients with GI symptoms — The diagnosis of COVID-19 is suspected primarily in patients with the new onset of fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea), while other consistent symptoms include myalgias, diarrhea, and aberrancy in sense of smell or taste. For patients with GI symptoms, we favor testing for COVID-19 in the following cases [21]:●Hospitalized patients with the new onset of GI symptoms●Outpatients with the new onset of GI symptoms for over 48 hours●Patients with established GI disease (eg, Crohn disease) with symptoms suggestive of a disease flare (eg, diarrhea, vomiting) In a minority of patients, GI symptoms such as diarrhea may be the presenting symptom or may precede the development of respiratory symptoms [16,17,21]. While the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be suspected based on presenting symptoms, additional factors that inform the decision to perform testing include the patient's geographic location, risk of exposure, rate of community transmission, and the availability of testing. The epidemiology and diagnosis of COVID-19 are discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Additionally, stool testing to exclude Clostridioides (C., formerly Clostridium) difficile infection is obtained for patients with diarrhea who are at risk for C. difficile infection (eg, recent antibiotic use) or who may require therapy (eg, antidiarrheal agents) to control symptoms. (See 'Managing symptoms related to viral infection' below.)Managing symptoms related to viral infection — For symptomatic therapy for infectious diarrhea, the antidiarrheal agent loperamide can be used in an initial dose of 4 mg and with a maximum daily dose of 16 mg in patients without fever, bloody stools, or risk factors for C. difficile infection. Use of loperamide for patients with acute diarrhea is discussed separately. (See ""Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings"", section on 'Management'.)For patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis (eg, nausea, vomiting), antiemetic drugs can often help relieve symptoms, in addition to supportive measures including oral or intravenous hydration. Management of patients with gastroenteritis and use of antiemetics are discussed separately. (See ""Acute viral gastroenteritis in adults"", section on 'Treatment' and ""Characteristics of antiemetic drugs"".) Symptomatic therapy for digestive symptoms may reduce the risk of complications such as electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypokalemia) or colonic ischemia related to volume depletion. (See ""Colonic ischemia"".)Specific management for COVID-19 is discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".). MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLESGeneral strategies to reduce risk of infection — If community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus is present, preventive measures to reduce exposure to the virus include (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Prevention'):●General preventive measures such as hand hygiene and social distancing.●Use of telemedicine visits for ongoing disease management.●Decreased frequency of routine laboratory and imaging surveillance when the associated risk is deemed to be low. ●Delay nonurgent endoscopic procedures (eg, colorectal cancer screening) (see 'Implications for endoscopy' below). ●Use of lower-volume laboratories off-site from larger healthcare facilities.●For patients with stable disease and without known or suspected COVID-19, continuing the established medication regimen to avoid a disease flare that may result in the need for diagnostic testing and/or inpatient hospitalization.●For patients on glucocorticoids, therapy should not be abruptly discontinued, but should be used at the lowest dose possible to control the underlying disease, regardless of COVID-19 exposure or infection status.Inflammatory bowel diseaseDiagnostic considerations during pandemic — For patients with symptoms of active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (eg, diarrhea) who are also at risk for COVID-19 (eg, recent exposure, high rate of community transmission), evaluation includes COVID-19 testing, stool studies to exclude enteric infections (eg, C. difficile infection), noninvasive inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin), and serum drug trough levels (for patients on biologic therapy). (See ""Treatment of Crohn disease in adults: Dosing and monitoring of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors"", section on 'Monitoring' and ""Overview of dosing and monitoring of biologic agents and small molecules for treating ulcerative colitis in adults"".)However, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus, nonspecific markers of inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein) may be elevated due to COVID-19 rather than IBD. (See ""Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn’s disease in adults"" and ""Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults"".) If fecal markers (eg, fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin) are not elevated, endoscopic evaluation is not necessary, as negative test results indicate the absence of active bowel inflammation. For most patients with an established diagnosis of IBD, elevated fecal inflammatory marker levels along with typical symptoms of active disease (eg, diarrhea) in the absence of infection are sufficient to initiate IBD treatment. (See ""Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis"", section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'.)Urgent endoscopic evaluation is reserved for patients in whom the results will change management [6]. For example, patients with suspected severe acute ulcerative colitis are typically started on glucocorticoids intravenously but still require at least a limited lower endoscopy with biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other conditions (eg, viral infection). (See ""Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis"", section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'.) Patients without COVID-19Patients with IBD in remission — Available data have suggested that patients with IBD in remission are not at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and that such patients should continue maintenance therapy to sustain remission [3,4,6]. Discontinuing maintenance therapy has been associated with disease relapse that may require hospitalization and/or glucocorticoid therapy, and thus, increase the risk of COVID-19 [3,22].Therapies for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn disease are discussed separately. (See ""Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults"", section on 'Maintenance of remission' and ""Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease"", section on 'Maintenance therapy'.)Therapies for maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis are discussed separately. (See ""Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis"", section on 'Maintenance of remission' and ""Management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults"", section on 'Maintenance of remission'.)Patients with active IBD — For patients with a flare of Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis in the absence of COVID-19, adding or escalating anti-inflammatory or biologic therapy may be required for symptomatic improvement and inducing remission. (See 'Diagnostic considerations during pandemic' above.) For example, therapeutic options for mild IBD include oral budesonide, aminosalicylates, and topical (rectal) therapy, while options for moderately to severely active IBD include biologic therapies (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents, anti-integrin agents, and anti-interleukin agents) [6]. The approach to using these therapies has not changed during the pandemic. However, if systemic glucocorticoids are deemed necessary for patients with active IBD during the pandemic, the lowest dose of glucocorticoid that will result in clinical response is used for a short duration before transitioning to another therapy that is glucocorticoid-sparing [6]. For example, management of a patient who is hospitalized with severe ulcerative colitis in the absence of COVID-19 may include treatment with a glucocorticoid (eg, methylprednisolone 16 to 20 mg intravenously every eight hours) for three days, and if there is no clinical response, medical therapy is escalated to infliximab [6,23]. Surgery is an alternative option for patients who do not improve with medical therapy. Additionally, in the COVID-19 era, the initial use of infliximab at a dose of 5 mg/kg rather than glucocorticoid therapy is a reasonable approach. Management of hospitalized patients with ulcerative colitis including escalating medical therapy is discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis"".)Diagnosis, pretreatment assessment, and medical management of Crohn disease are discussed separately:●(See ""Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn’s disease in adults"".)●(See ""Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults"".)●(See ""Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease"".)Diagnosis, pretreatment assessment, and medical management of ulcerative colitis are discussed separately:●(See ""Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults"".)●(See ""Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis"".)●(See ""Management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults"".)●(See ""Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis"".)Patients with COVID-19Adjusting IBD medications — Adjustments to medication regimens in patients with IBD with suspected or known COVID-19 should be individualized based on the severity of infection, patient comorbidities, and the existing medication regimen. Expanding indications for SARS-CoV-2 testing (eg, screening prior to endoscopy) may result in increased identification of asymptomatic patients who are infected [6]. The goal of medication adjustment is to reduce immunosuppression during active viral infection to lower the risk of COVID-19-related complications (eg, pneumonia) [24]. Our overall approach for patients with IBD in remission includes [25-27] (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults""):●Therapies that can be continued without interruption:•Budesonide.•Aminosalicylates.•Topical rectal therapy (eg, topical glucocorticoid).•Antibiotics.●Therapies requiring adjustment:•Systemic glucocorticoids – Reduce dose of systemic glucocorticoid (eg, prednisone dose to <20 mg daily) or transition to oral budesonide. (See ""Overview of budesonide therapy for adults with inflammatory bowel disease"".)Although systemic glucocorticoids convey an increased risk of infections, abrupt discontinuation is not possible, and patients should receive the lowest required dose for the shortest period of time necessary to minimize adverse reactions. (See ""Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids"".)•Immunomodulators – Discontinue thiopurines (ie, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) and methotrexate. •Tofacitinib – Discontinue tofacitinib, a small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor because it has been associated with an increased risk of other viral infections (ie, herpes zoster infection) and its mechanism of action is to suppress T-cell function. (See ""Management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults"", section on 'Tofacitinib'.) •Biologic agents – Discontinue biologic therapy (anti-TNF agents, ustekinumab, or vedolizumab).Resumption of therapy — The optimal time to resume immunosuppressive medications after SARS-CoV-2 infection is uncertain, while expert consensus has stated that medications can be resumed after negative testing for COVID-19 and/or a symptom-free observation period of 14 days. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Preliminary data suggested that induction therapy for active ulcerative colitis in the setting of recent mild COVID-19 was not associated with an increased risk for progressing to severe infection. In a case report of a 54-year-old female patient with mild COVID-19 and active ulcerative colitis, treatment with infliximab at weeks 6 and 7 following the diagnosis was associated with achieving clinical remission and recovery from COVID-19 [28]. Prognosis — Case series including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and chronic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, IBD) have provided preliminary outcome data [5,28]. As an example, in a study of 86 patients with COVID-19 in the setting of immune-mediated inflammatory disease (including 37 patients with IBD), 14 patients (16 percent) required hospitalization, and the mortality rate was 7 percent [5]. In another study of 40 patients with IBD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 11 patients (28 percent) on immunomodulators and seven patients (18 percent) on biologic monotherapy, 21 patients (53 percent) were hospitalized, but none required intensive care unit admission [28]. However, two patients with ulcerative colitis (5 percent) died from complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome; both of these patients were older (ie, >75 years of age), and one patient had been on methotrexate.DISEASE REGISTRIES — Data on patients with chronic gastrointestinal or liver disease who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus are accumulating, and disease-specific patient registries include:●SECURE-IBD registry – The SECURE-IBD registry is an international database that collects data on disease severity and outcomes for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus [29]. The available data have suggested that hospitalization rates have been highest among patients with moderately to severely active IBD, which emphasizes the importance of treating active inflammation. (See 'Patients with COVID-19' above.)●SECURE-Cirrhosis registry – The SECURE-Cirrhosis registry is an international database that collects data on disease severity and outcomes for patients with chronic liver disease (ie, cirrhosis, liver transplantation recipients) [30].IMPLICATIONS FOR ENDOSCOPY — During the COVID-19 pandemic, nonurgent endoscopic procedures have been deferred with a goal of reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, conserving personal protective equipment, and reserving clinical resources for managing patients with COVID-19. The decision to perform endoscopic procedures and the necessary protocols are informed by state, local, and institutional rules in addition to guidance from professional societies [31,32]. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Gastroenterology and hepatology'.)Indications for elective procedures that should be delayed, in addition to indications for urgent or emergent procedures that should not be delayed, can be found on the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy website.Strategies for reducing the risk of transmitting infection during gastrointestinal endoscopy that have been endorsed by professional societies, including the use of personal protective equipment, can be accessed here.Infection control strategies for use during aerosol-generating procedures (eg, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP], endoscopic ultrasound) are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)The approach to managing some patients with acute gastrointestinal (GI) and liver disease has been modified because of the COVID-19 pandemic [33]: ●Patients with GI bleeding – Early reports suggest that GI bleeding is a common indication for gastroenterology consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic, while strategies to use medical therapy and delay endoscopic evaluation have been developed [34,35]. Some centers have suggested medical therapy for patients with suspected nonvariceal upper GI bleeding including continuous intravenous proton pump inhibitor, antiemetics, and optimizing coagulation status [34]. For example, in a series of six patients with acute upper GI bleeding and COVID-19 pneumonia, management included intravenous proton pump inhibitor and clinical observation, and no patients required urgent endoscopy during their hospitalization [35]. Rationale for this conservative approach also includes data that have suggested that delaying endoscopy for 24 hours was not associated with increased mortality in patients with acute upper GI bleeding [36]. For most patients with lower GI bleeding in the setting of COVID-19, endoscopic evaluation can be initially delayed and then performed on an outpatient basis after resolution of the acute illness [34]. Timing of endoscopy for patients with GI bleeding is discussed separately. (See ""Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults"" and ""Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults"".)●Patients with acute cholangitis or biliary obstruction – Strategies for managing patients who have acute cholangitis and/or obstructive jaundice are informed by available resources (eg, endoscopy space, nursing, and anesthesia services), the patient's hemodynamic status and location (eg, intensive care unit) and the availability of alternatives to ERCP (eg, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, initial medical management) [34,37]. Management of acute cholangitis is discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Acute cholangitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Patients with COVID-19 typically present with fever and respiratory symptoms; however, gastrointestinal symptoms (GI) (eg, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea) have been reported in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

ID:127582,medical,medical_review,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation,/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-issues-related-to-solid-organ-transplantation?search=covid+19&source=search_result&selectedTitle=5%7E150&usage_type=default,"INTRODUCTION — Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for COVID-19 because they are immunosuppressed and have frequent contact with the health care system. There is also a theoretical risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) with organ transplantation, although no cases of organ transplant-transmitted infection have been described to date.This topic reviews aspects of COVID-19 that are specific to solid organ transplantation, including screening prior to transplantation, distinct clinical features, managing immunosuppression, and important drug interactions. Other aspects of COVID-19 care are discussed separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)RISK OF TRANSMISSIONPotential for donor-derived infection — The risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from an organ donor to a recipient is theoretical and based upon the detection of viral RNA in organs that can be transplanted (eg, lung, heart, kidney, intestine) and in other sites (ie, blood, urine) [1-4]. While it is clear that viable infectious virus can be cultured from the lung and other parts of the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, additional study is needed to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 detected at extra-respiratory sites is intact, replication competent, and therefore transmissible by non-lung organ transplantation.To date, no organ donor-derived infections have been reported. Similarly, bloodborne transmission has not been reported and is not expected; both the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 viremia and its magnitude are low [1,4-6]. (See ""Blood donor screening: Medical history"", section on 'SARS-CoV-2 (no evidence of transfusion-transmitted infection)'.)Posttransplantation risk — It is not known whether solid organ transplant recipients are at higher risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population. However, chronic immunosuppression may lower the infectious dose needed to cause COVID-19 and impair adequate immune control once infection is established. Organ transplant recipients also have frequent contact with the health care system and are therefore potentially more likely to be exposed to the virus.Like other immunosuppressed persons, solid organ transplant recipients may shed greater amounts of virus for longer durations than otherwise healthy hosts. Thus, they may be more likely to spread infection to others. Further data is needed to confirm these theories and to quantify viral dynamics and transmission risks in the solid organ transplant population.DEFERRAL OF NONURGENT TRANSPLANTATION — To minimize the risk of infection and conserve hospital resources, elective transplantation (eg, living-donor kidney transplantation) and nonurgent, deceased-donor transplantation are being deferred at some transplant centers where the community prevalence of COVID-19 is high and/or where resources (personnel, hospital or intensive care unit [ICU] beds, operating rooms, other equipment) are limited [7].Life-saving transplantation continues to be performed, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have classified organ transplantation as a tier 3b activity: Do not delay, on the basis of assessment of the potential risks compared with known benefits [8].PRETRANSPLANTATION SCREENING — All organ donors and potential recipients should be screened for COVID-19 prior to organ procurement. This is necessary to prevent initiation of potent induction immunosuppression in the context of active infection and for the safety of the organ transplant recipients (who are typically potently immunosuppressed in the immediate posttransplant period) and the organ procurement team.Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; primarily used to detect active infection) is the main assay used for screening. The utility of serology (primarily used to detect past infection) for pretransplant screening has not been established. However, once the performance characteristics of serology are more well established among solid organ transplant recipients, serologies may become a helpful adjunct assay. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Donor screening — All donors should be screened for COVID-19 [9]. We generally perform a careful history, obtain chest imaging, and perform microbiologic testing. In all cases the decision to proceed to transplantation should take into account the urgency of the transplant and the risk and benefits in each individual. As general principles:●Donors with known or suspected active COVID-19 based on exposure, symptoms, or chest imaging should generally be declined or deferred.●Donors with known or suspected COVID-19 within the past 28 days should generally be declined or deferred.●Donors who have been exposed to individuals with known or suspected COVID-19 in the recent past (eg, within the past 21 days) should generally be declined or deferred. However, if such a donor tests negative for COVID-19, transplantation can be considered in selected cases (eg, if transplantation is urgently life-saving).●Donors should also be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR performed on respiratory tract samples. The approach to screening varies among institutions and by the organ to be transplanted:•For deceased organ donors (especially lung donors), it is recommended to sample both the upper respiratory tract (eg, nasopharyngeal swab) and the lower respiratory tract (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage) when screening, based upon data suggesting increased sensitivity of lower tract (ie, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) specimens compared with upper tract specimens.•For other donors, screening for COVID-19 should be performed on a single upper respiratory tract sample, at a minimum. The need to obtain serial samples and/or lower respiratory tract samples varies among centers and is often individualized.For living donors who test positive for COVID-19 or for deceased donors who have recovered from COVID-19, the optimal deferral period is not known. Based upon the mean duration of viral shedding (20 days) [10], the American Society of Transplantation (AST) suggests waiting at least 28 days from the time of diagnosis and complete resolution of symptoms (if living donor) before organ donation/procurement be considered [9]. As knowledge of COVID-19 accumulates, screening recommendations are expected to evolve.Candidate screening — All potential organ transplant recipients should be screened for COVID-19 by history, chest imaging, and microbiologic testing prior to transplantation. Although data is lacking, COVID-19 can be asymptomatic, and there is concern that the intense immunosuppression given at the time of transplantation could result in rapidly progressive and potentially fatal COVID-19:●All potential organ recipients should be screened for COVID-19 prior to transplantation. At most transplant centers this includes RT-PCR of an upper respiratory tract specimen (eg, nasopharyngeal swab), a thorough symptom and exposure history, and chest imaging. A chest radiograph is usually sufficient for patients who lack respiratory symptoms, however, for those with respiratory symptoms (even if minor), computed tomography (CT) of the chest is appropriate.●Candidates with active COVID-19 and/or signs or symptoms of other respiratory illnesses should generally be deferred for transplantation.For patients with active COVID-19 and patients who screen positive, the optimal deferral period is not known. The AST suggests waiting until all symptoms have resolved and at least two RT-PCRs for SARS-CoV-2 have been negative [9]. As with any transplantation, the risk of transplantation must be balanced with the risk of not transplanting a patient with acute or recent COVID-19.PREVENTION — Preventive measures for organ transplant recipients are similar to those defined for the general population (eg, social distancing, careful hand and respiratory hygiene). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Prevention'.)One additional consideration is that solid organ transplant recipients who have COVID-19 may shed greater amounts of virus for longer durations than nonimmunosuppressed patients. Thus, a longer duration of isolation and/or testing to document viral clearance to help reduce the likelihood of spreading the infection to others may be needed. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)ACTIVE COVID-19 IN SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTSClinical presentationClinical features — Clinical features of COVID-19 among solid organ transplant recipients are variable and similar to those in nonimmunocompromised patients. However, fever appears to be less common, possibly as a consequence of the effects of immunosuppressive therapy on the systemic inflammatory response [11-13]. As an example, in two case series of solid organ transplant recipients in New York City, fever was a presenting symptom in only 58 to 70 percent [12,13]. Lymphopenia is also common and may be more profound than in nontransplant patients with COVID-19 [13]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Severity of illness — It is unclear if solid organ transplant recipients have a higher risk of severe disease compared with nontransplant patients if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many solid organ transplant recipients have medical comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) that have been associated with more severe COVID-19 disease and mortality, which makes the attributable impact of solid organ transplantation on disease severity difficult to assess.Limited data suggest that solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection may have severe disease, similar to that described in non-solid organ transplant patients with serious underlying comorbidities [12,13]. As an example, in the study of 90 solid organ transplant recipients cited above, 24 percent had mild disease (outpatient care only), 46 percent had moderate disease (admitted to general inpatient floor), and 30 percent had severe disease (mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], or death) [12]. At a median of 20 days, the mortality rate was 18 percent. Compared with patients who had mild to moderate disease, those with severe disease were older and more likely to have hypertension or active cancer, but other comorbidities associated with severe disease in the general population were not significantly different between the groups. In addition, there were no significant differences between the groups in the types of organ transplant or the median time from transplant to COVID-19 diagnosis.Risk factors for severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)Effect of immunosuppression — The impact of immunosuppression in the solid organ transplant population on COVID-19 disease severity remains unclear. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 appears to represent an interplay between direct virally mediated injury and the associated host response, with experimental data suggesting that a dysregulated and hyperintense immune response may mediate more severe disease [14]. Since immunosuppressive agents modulate several aspects of the host immune response, the severity of COVID-19 infection could potentially be affected by the type, combinations, and intensity of immunosuppression. As an example, certain immunosuppressive medications can either directly (eg, lymphocyte-depleting antibodies) or indirectly (eg, antimetabolites) cause lymphopenia, which is a reported risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. Specific agents that have been independently associated with decreased immune responses to vaccines (eg, mammalian [mechanistic] target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors, mycophenolate) could theoretically impair the ability to develop an adequate immune response to natural infection. Conversely, some experimental data suggest that mTOR inhibitors may have some biological activity against SARS-CoV-2 [15]. Additional studies are required to determine the impact of specific immunosuppressive agents on the course of COVID-19 infection.Diagnosis — Criteria for testing for COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients are similar to those for the general population. However, clinicians should have a higher index of suspicion of infection, as is generally recommended for immunosuppressed individuals:●For solid organ transplant recipients with suspected COVID-19 who are hospitalized, testing is recommended.●For solid organ transplant recipients with mild symptoms, optimal practice is not defined. While some favor testing all such patients based upon the potential for rapid disease progression, others favor making a clinical diagnosis and monitoring the patient at home. Thus, the decision is often individualized based upon local COVID-19 prevalence, available resources, and patient-provider preference.●Routine screening of asymptomatic solid organ transplant recipients is not recommended.Specific testing methods are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing'.)ManagementGeneral considerations — The approach to the management of acute COVID-19 infection in solid organ transplant recipients is similar to that for nontransplant patients. All specific antiviral agents being used for the treatment of COVID-19 are investigational. Use of these agents is generally limited to hospitalized patients who have or are at risk for severe disease. When possible, treatment should be given as part of a clinical trial.These issues are discussed in more detail separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Adjusting immunosuppression — Adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen are necessarily individualized, based upon disease severity, the specific regimen used, type of organ transplanted, time posttransplant, and the risk of acute allograft rejection [12].Although the optimal approach is not defined, we usually reduce immunosuppression in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection (eg, those requiring hospitalization):●As a first step, we often reduce or hold the antimetabolite (eg, mycophenolate mofetil/sodium), particularly for patients with lymphopenia (eg, absolute lymphocyte count <700 cells/mL).●We generally continue the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) because CNIs inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 pathways, which may contribute to the development of the severe, dysregulated immune response seen in some patients with severe COVID-19.●We typically avoid use of high-dose glucocorticoids as these agents have been associated with prolonged viral shedding and may predispose to poor outcomes, based on experience with other epidemic coronaviruses. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)However, in all cases the decision to reduce immunosuppression must be carefully weighed against the risk for acute rejection, particularly in transplant recipients who generally require high levels of maintenance immunosuppression (eg, lung or heart recipients). The optimal management of immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection is not known, and data are limited to case reports and series [12,13,16,17].There are also concerns that COVID-19 infection itself may increase the risk for acute rejection and that an overly intense inflammatory host immune response might contribute to overall disease severity. Thus, attenuating the immune response by maintaining low-dose immunosuppression could theoretically be beneficial. In addition, experimental data suggest that certain immunosuppressive agents such as mTOR inhibitors may have some biological activity against SARS-CoV-2 [15]. Additional studies are required to confirm these findings.Additional guidance on adjusting immunosuppression in transplant recipients with active infection can be found in the following topic reviews:●(See ""Kidney transplantation in adults: Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy"", section on 'Patients who develop an infection'.)●(See ""Maintenance immunosuppression following lung transplantation"", section on 'Monitoring and adjusting maintenance therapy'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'Issues for ventricular assist devices and cardiac transplantation'.)Recommendations from specific medical societies are listed separately. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Drug-drug interactions — A number of experimental COVID-19 therapies have potential drug-drug interactions with medications that are commonly used among solid organ transplant recipients. In particular, medications that prolong the QT interval (eg, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin) should be used with caution since many solid organ transplant recipients are taking a CNI, which may also prolong the QT interval. In addition, care should be taken with protease inhibitors (such as lopinavir and ritonavir), which can reduce the metabolism and significantly increase blood levels of CNIs (table 1). SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●COVID-19 poses new challenges for individual solid organ transplant candidates and recipients, as well as the process of organ transplantation. (See 'Introduction' above.)●There is a theoretical risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) from an organ donor to a recipient based upon the detection of viral RNA in organs that can be transplanted (eg, lung, heart, kidney, intestine), although donor-derived infections have not been reported to date. (See 'Potential for donor-derived infection' above.)●Because of this risk and the potential for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to health care providers, all solid organ donor and transplant candidates should be screened for COVID-19 by history, chest imaging, and microbiologic testing. (See 'Pretransplantation screening' above.)●Posttransplantation, solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for acquisition of COVID-19 because they are immunocompromised and have frequent contact with the health care system, although this association has not been studied. (See 'Posttransplantation risk' above.)●The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients are variable and similar to those observed in nonimmunocompromised patients. However, fever appears to be less common. Whether the disease course is more severe is not known. (See 'Clinical presentation' above and 'Severity of illness' above.)●The approach to diagnosis is similar to that for the general population. Because signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be subtle in transplant recipients and disease progression can be rapid, some clinicians have a lower threshold for evaluating and testing transplant recipients. (See 'Diagnosis' above.)●The approach to management (eg, use of antivirals, supportive care) is also similar to that for the general population, although careful attention should be paid to potential drug-drug interactions and effects on the immunosuppressive regimen. (See 'General considerations' above and 'Drug-drug interactions' above.)●Adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen are necessarily individualized, based upon disease severity, the specific regimen used, type of organ transplant, time posttransplant, and the risk of acute allograft rejection. Some organ transplant recipients recover without reduction in immunosuppression, which carries the risk of rejection and immune reconstitution. Conversely, continued immunosuppression may enhance the risk of uncontrolled infection. (See 'Adjusting immunosuppression' above.)",transplant to COVID-19 diagnosis.

ID:127933,medical,medical_review,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Care of patients with systemic rheumatic disease during the pandemic,/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-care-of-patients-with-systemic-rheumatic-disease-during-the-pandemic?search=covid+19&source=search_result&selectedTitle=6%7E150&usage_type=default,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. By 2020, infection with this virus led to a pandemic that has spread throughout most countries of the world. The illness caused by this virus, which has been termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily manifests as a lung infection with symptoms ranging from those of a mild upper respiratory infection to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Severe illness can occur in healthy individuals, but also in patients with underlying medical conditions, including patients with systemic rheumatic diseases. All medical professionals, including rheumatology clinicians, are tasked with rapidly adjusting their practice to curtail the spread of COVID-19, while providing life-sustaining care to their patients.This topic will discuss the care of patients with systemic rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other important aspects of COVID-19 infection are discussed in detail separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)RISK OF COVID-19 INFECTIONDisease- and comorbidity-related risks — The presence of a rheumatic disease alone is not known to be associated with an increased risk for developing COVID-19 or with an adverse outcome from the infection. However, patients with various rheumatic diseases have a higher prevalence of several comorbidities such as advanced age, chronic pulmonary and kidney disease, heart disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes [1-7], which in turn are risk factors for severe illness with COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Impact of age'.)There is limited evidence regarding the degree of risk associated with established rheumatic disease. In one series of 86 patients in New York with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases diagnosed with definite or presumed COVID-19, the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization was similar to that for infected patients in the general population in New York City [8]. However, limited observational data have suggested that patients with active rheumatic disease may be at higher risk for developing infections [9-11], although these studies were performed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.Certain laboratory abnormalities seen in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases have been associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19, such as lymphopenia (particularly low CD4+ T cells) and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and creatine kinase (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'); these abnormalities result from the infection and the immune response to the infection. It is unknown whether such abnormalities, if pre-existing due to another disorder (eg, a systemic rheumatic disease), have any impact on disease outcome.Risks associated with rheumatic disease therapies — It is not known whether there is an association of any specific rheumatologic treatment with an increased risk of COVID-19 or its complications, although rheumatic disease therapies have been associated with higher risk of other infections [12,13]. Limited data from observational studies are mixed, with some reports suggesting there may be an increased risk of COVID-19 in patients receiving systemic rheumatic disease therapies, and others suggesting a decreased risk. As examples:●In a series of 86 patients in New York diagnosed with definite or presumed COVID-19, and who also had an immune-mediated inflammatory disease (including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease), those who were receiving biologic agents or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors at baseline were no more likely to require hospitalization for their infection than patients receiving nonbiologic conventional immunosuppressive agents [8].●In a report from the Lombardy region of Italy, where COVID-19 was highly prevalent, of 320 patients with rheumatic disease receiving a biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), only eight were diagnosed with or strongly suspected of COVID-19, and five additional patients had experienced a known exposure to an infected individual but remained asymptomatic [14]. Only one of the rheumatic disease patients required hospital admission and was treated for several days with low-flow oxygen. During this period, over 33,000 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in this region and over 1250 required admission to intensive care.●Another report from the Lombardy region of Italy, involving 1193 patients with psoriasis receiving either biologic agents or conventional small molecule drugs, found that compared with the general population in the region, patients treated with biologics were at higher risk for being symptomatic from COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3.43 [95% CI 2.25-5.73]), to be self-quarantined at home (OR 9.05 [95% CI 5.61-14.61]), and hospitalized (OR 3.59 [95% CI 1.49-8.63]); however, they were not found to be at increased risk of admission to an intensive care unit or of death [15].●Although there has been speculation regarding a potential protective role for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 therapy, substantial numbers of patients among both clinician- and patient self-reported cohorts of rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 were taking HCQ at the time they were diagnosed with the infection (22 and 28 percent of patients, respectively, as of April 27, 2020) [16]. A majority of the patients taking HCQ were also taking other immune-modulating therapies.CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONSClinical presentation of the infection in rheumatic disease patients — The clinical features of COVID-19 among patients with systemic rheumatic diseases are variable and are not known to be different than patients without these underlying diseases. There are insufficient data from reported cases to determine whether the type of rheumatic disease or the intensity of the immunosuppressive agents used influence the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in this population (see 'Disease registries' below). However, it is possible that some rheumatic disease features may be difficult to distinguish from COVID-19. (See 'Rheumatic disease features that can mimic or be mimicked by COVID-19' below.)Rheumatic disease features that can mimic or be mimicked by COVID-19 — A variety of rheumatic diseases may have clinical features that can mimic or be mimicked by COVID-19, such as malaise, myalgias, and fatigue. For patients who carry an existing diagnosis of a rheumatic disease, the clinician may need to distinguish disease flare from possible COVID-19 infection, and a high level of suspicion should be maintained where COVID-19 may be prevalent. The approach to testing for COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Specific examples of such conditions include diseases that can manifest with fever (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), headache (eg, giant cell arteritis [GCA]), gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, spondyloarthritis, systemic sclerosis [SSc], SLE, and Behçet syndrome), dyspnea (eg, interstitial pulmonary disease due to rheumatoid arthritis, SSc, or SLE), stroke (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome [APS]), pernio- or chilblain-like lesions, sometimes called ""COVID toes"" (eg, chilblain lupus erythematosus), and a Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIC-S), sometimes termed pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (eg, Kawasaki disease). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Clinical features'.)In addition, laboratory abnormalities such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels, ferritin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and creatine kinase levels can be seen in both the infection and with various rheumatic diseases.Medications used to treat rheumatic disease may also cause adverse effects that can mimic clinical manifestations of COVID-19 (eg, sulfasalazine [SSZ], which may cause gastrointestinal symptoms, and methotrexate [MTX], which may cause pulmonary abnormalities).Referral for rheumatologic evaluation may be appropriate in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 who do not have an established rheumatic disease diagnosis yet have any additional clinical feature concerning for rheumatic disease (eg, findings suggestive of synovitis or serologies characteristic of autoimmune rheumatic disease).MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH KNOWN OR SUSPECTED SARS-CoV-2 EXPOSURE OR INFECTIONMedication management in stable asymptomatic patients following exposure — Adjustments to medication regimens in patients with stable rheumatic disease who are asymptomatic but thought to be recently exposed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus should be individualized. Our general approach is as follows [17]:●Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)/chloroquine (CQ), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be continued.●Whether methotrexate (MTX) or leflunomide (LEF) should be discontinued must be assessed on a case-by-case basis weighing the potential risks of infection and its sequelae against the possible risk of rheumatic disease flare during the period the drug is held. If the medications have been temporarily held, they can generally be resumed pending a negative test result for COVID-19 or after two weeks of symptom-free observation.●Cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA), tacrolimus, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, abatacept, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (eg, tofacitinib) should be stopped temporarily, pending a negative test result for COVID-19 or after two weeks of symptom-free observation.●Interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitors may be continued in selected patients, particularly those at high risk for developing a cytokine release-like syndrome, preferably in a study protocol. The decision to use these agents should be made in close consultation with the experts in infectious disease and critical care involved in the management of the patient's acute illness. The role of IL-6 blockade in the management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)The approach described above is largely based upon expert opinion and extrapolation from the management of patients on these medications who have developed other infections and is consistent with the management practices recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [17], as well as being generally similar to other guidelines [18,19]. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Use of NSAIDs, including both indications and contraindications for their use, would not differ from patients without exposure to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with most international and specialty guidelines, given the lack of scientific evidence for any novel increased risk associated with NSAID use in patients with COVID-19 [17,20-22]. HCQ and SSZ can be continued given the relatively low risk of serious infection associated with either of them [23,24]. In addition, for diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), discontinuation of HCQ is associated with a disease flare. The limited evidence and role of HCQ/CQ in the management of COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine'.)While treatment with MTX and LEF are also associated with a relatively low risk of serious infection [25,26], particularly when given as monotherapy, we decide whether or not to continue these medications on a case-by-case basis.The rationale for temporarily discontinuing the other immunosuppressive drugs, biologic agents, and JAK inhibitors are based upon their associated increased risk of serious infection compared with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) [12,13], and the theoretically low likelihood of a disease flare for withholding these medications over such a limited time period. One exception to discontinuation of biologic agents may be the use of IL-6 inhibitors, given some reports of potential benefit for patients who develop an intense inflammatory state similar to cytokine release syndrome due to severe COVID-19; however, randomized trials to examine their efficacy during infection are ongoing. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)Medication management with documented or presumptive COVID-19 — Adjustments to medication regimens in patients with documented or presumptive COVID-19 should be individualized with specific attention to the severity of the infection. Our overall approach is as follows:●Antimalarial therapies (ie, HCQ/CQ) may be continued, with the caveat that hospitalized patients may require additional surveillance given that cardiotoxicity may be heightened in patients with COVID-19. Concomitant use of medications that can prolong the QT interval should be avoided. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)'.)●SSZ, MTX, LEF, immunosuppressants (eg, MMF, AZA), biologic agents other than IL-6 receptor inhibitors, and JAK inhibitors should be stopped or held.●For patients with severe respiratory, cardiac, or kidney involvement, NSAIDs should be discontinued as they would be in patients without COVID-19.●IL-6 receptor inhibitors may be continued in selected patients, particularly those at high risk for developing a cytokine release-like syndrome, preferably in a study protocol. The decision to use these agents should be made in close consultation with the experts in infectious disease and critical care involved in the management of the patient's acute illness. The role of IL-6 blockade in the management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)●Glucocorticoids should not be abruptly discontinued.The approach described above is largely based upon expert opinion and extrapolation from the management of patients taking these medications who have developed other serious infections and is consistent with the management practices recommended by the ACR [17], as well as being generally similar to other guidelines [18,19]. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Rheumatology'.)Given the low risk of serious infection associated with HCQ or CQ as well as the potential benefit of preventing a rheumatic disease flare, we generally continue these therapies in patients who are already taking them (see 'Medication management in stable asymptomatic patients following exposure' above). The rationale for holding SSZ is mainly related to concerns about potential adverse effects from this agent (eg, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, hepatitis, cytopenias, and, rarely, pneumonitis) that could be confused with clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19. Additionally, temporarily holding SSZ for up to two to three weeks would be unlikely to result in significant rheumatic disease flares.We discontinue MTX, LEF, immunosuppressants, biologic agents other than IL-6 blockers, and JAK inhibitors given our concern for impairing the host defense against COVID-19 and the risk of causing additional infections, although there are no data to confirm or convincingly refute such risk. In addition, the risk of rheumatic disease flare is likely to be relatively low in the limited period during which the antirheumatic drugs are likely to be held. Most infections associated with these medications are bacterial and opportunistic in origin; these risks remain relevant, as a substantial proportion of patients with COVID-19 develop the complication of bacterial pneumonia [27]. Additional risks of treatment with certain biologics and JAK inhibitors include reactivation of viral infections, including herpes zoster [28].Although glucocorticoids convey increased risk of infections, abrupt discontinuation is not feasible or safe in seriously ill patients. To minimize adverse reactions, we treat patients who require glucocorticoids for systemic rheumatic disease with the lowest necessary dose for the shortest period of time. (See ""Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids"".)Postinfection management — The optimal time to resume immunosuppressive medications after infection with COVID-19 is unknown; we generally do not restart immunosuppressive medications until patients are no longer symptomatic and at least two weeks have passed since documented infection. There are limited data to address this issue. In a small observational study of nine patients, seroconversion was detected in all patients after two weeks, viral loads progressively decreased, but despite their detection, live virus was unable to be isolated after eight days [29]. Further information regarding how long patients may remain infectious is needed.MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF INFECTION OR KNOWN EXPOSUREGeneral principles●Patients with rheumatic diseases should be practicing the widely recommended prevention strategies that are focused on mitigating infection risk. This includes adopting practices such as optimal hand hygiene, physical distancing, and wearing a mask in public when adequate physical distancing is not possible. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Prevention'.)●For patients with newly diagnosed, stable, or active disease, management generally does not differ from usual treatment approaches in the absence of COVID-19. We initiate or continue all medications indicated for the management of the patient's systemic rheumatic disease. These may include conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and other immunosuppressive agents, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)/chloroquine (CQ), sulfasalazine (SSZ), methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide (LEF), tacrolimus, cyclosporine (CSA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and azathioprine (AZA); biologic agents (eg, abatacept, tocilizumab); Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors; and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Continuation of HCQ/CQ is particularly important in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), if available, especially those with active or severe disease and those who are pregnant.●Glucocorticoids should not be abruptly discontinued, but should be used at the lowest dose possible to control the underlying rheumatic disease, regardless of exposure or infection status.Modifications to routine rheumatologic care — Modifications to routine rheumatologic care that minimize risk of exposure to COVID-19 when possible include:●Optimal use of telehealth visits.●Decreased frequency of routine laboratory surveillance when associated risk is deemed to be low. Decisions regarding the safest intervals for testing need to be individualized, based, for example, upon the patient's overall clinical status, comorbidities, prior stability of testing, and medication use.●Use of lower-volume laboratories offsite from larger health care facilities.●For patients in areas affected by the epidemic who receive treatment at infusion centers, an additional treatment option that may be appropriate is switching to forms of the same medications or medications of the same class that can be self-administered by subcutaneous injection. However, neither the theoretical added safety benefits nor risk of disease flare with this approach have been formally evaluated in this setting, and the decision should be individualized.Prognosis — There is no available evidence identifying risk factors of poor outcomes with COVID-19 infection specific to patients with rheumatic disease, nor evidence of adverse rheumatic disease outcomes following infection other than the short-term risk of increased disease activity due to temporary drug discontinuation.DISEASE REGISTRIES — To improve the understanding of the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection on patients with systemic rheumatic diseases, we strongly urge that all such patients be enrolled in patient registries whenever possible, including the following and other national and regional registries:●COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry●The EULAR – COVID-19 Reporting registry for rheumatologists and other cliniciansLINKS FOR PATIENT EDUCATION — Links to resources with information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for patients with rheumatic diseases from select rheumatology society and government-sponsored guidelines are presented separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"", section on 'Rheumatology'.)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Rheumatology'.)SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●The presence of a rheumatic disease alone is not known to be associated with an increased risk for developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or an adverse outcome from the infection. Patients with various rheumatic diseases, however, have a higher prevalence of several comorbidities such as advanced age, chronic pulmonary and kidney disease, heart disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, which in turn are risk factors for severe illness with COVID-19. (See 'Disease- and comorbidity-related risks' above.)●It is not known whether any specific rheumatologic treatments are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 or its complications, although rheumatic disease therapies have been associated with higher risk of other infections. (See 'Risks associated with rheumatic disease therapies' above.)●The clinical features of COVID-19 among patients with systemic rheumatic diseases are variable and are not known to be different from those in patients without these underlying diseases. However, a variety of rheumatic diseases may have clinical features that can mimic or be mimicked by COVID-19, such as malaise, myalgias, and fatigue. For patients who carry an existing diagnosis of a rheumatic disease, the clinician may need to distinguish disease flare from possible COVID-19 infection, and a high level of suspicion should be maintained where COVID-19 may be prevalent. (See 'Clinical presentation of the infection in rheumatic disease patients' above and 'Rheumatic disease features that can mimic or be mimicked by COVID-19' above.)●Adjustments to medication regimens in patients with stable rheumatic disease who are asymptomatic but thought to be recently exposed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus should be individualized. Our general approach is as follows (see 'Medication management in stable asymptomatic patients following exposure' above):•Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)/chloroquine (CQ), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be continued.•Methotrexate (MTX) or leflunomide (LEF) discontinuation is determined on a case-by-case basis.•Cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA), tacrolimus, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, abatacept, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (eg, tofacitinib) should be stopped temporarily, pending a negative test result for COVID-19 or after two weeks of symptom-free observation.•Interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitors may be continued in selected patients, particularly those at high risk for developing a cytokine release-like syndrome, preferably in a study protocol.●Adjustments to medication regimens in patients with documented or presumptive COVID-19 should be individualized with specific attention to the severity of the infection. Our general approach is as follows (see 'Medication management with documented or presumptive COVID-19' above):•HCQ/CQ may be continued, with the caveat that hospitalized patients may require additional surveillance given that cardiotoxicity may be heightened in patients with COVID-19.•SSZ, MTX, LEF, immunosuppressants (eg, MMF, AZA), biologic agents other than IL-6 receptor inhibitors, and JAK inhibitors should be stopped or held.•For patients with severe respiratory, cardiac, or kidney involvement, NSAIDs should be discontinued, as they would be in patients without COVID-19.•IL-6 receptor inhibitors may be continued in selected patients, particularly those at high risk for developing a cytokine release-like syndrome, preferably in a study protocol. •Glucocorticoids should not be abruptly discontinued.●The optimal time to resume immunosuppressive medications after infection with COVID-19 is unknown; we generally do not restart immunosuppressive medications until patients are no longer symptomatic and at least two weeks have passed since documented infection. (See 'Postinfection management' above.)●The management of patients with newly diagnosed, stable, or active rheumatic disease who are not known to have infection with or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 generally does not differ from usual treatment approaches in the absence of COVID-19. We initiate or continue all medications indicated for the management of the patient's systemic rheumatic disease. (See 'General principles' above.)●Modifications to routine rheumatologic care that minimize risk of exposure to COVID-19 when possible include optimal use of telehealth visits, decreased frequency of routine laboratory surveillance when associated risk is deemed to be low, and the use of lower-volume laboratories offsite from larger health care facilities.

ID:127762,medical,medical_review,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines,/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-intensive-care-ventilation-with-anesthesia-machines?search=covid+19&source=search_result&selectedTitle=7%7E150&usage_type=default,"INTRODUCTION — The pneumonia associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or nCoV) may lead to respiratory failure with profound hypoxemia requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The rapidly spreading pandemic may result in utilization of all available intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators in individual institutions and regions. Repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term use for days or weeks to ventilate COVID-19 patients or other patients requiring mechanical ventilation has been proposed, but is somewhat unprecedented. Furthermore, anesthesia machines have only been rarely used to administer inhalation anesthetics during prolonged ventilation. This topic will address management of short-term or long-term intensive care ventilation with an anesthesia machine, emphasizing this use for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [1]. Airway management and anesthetic care of patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection for surgical procedures, including preventing infection of anesthesia personnel or contamination of anesthesia machines and equipment are addressed in a separate topic. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)Use of standard ICU ventilators and ventilation of critically ill patients COVID-19 patients are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.)Other details regarding obstetric and critical care of patients with COVID-19 infection, and general medical management are available in additional topics:●(See ""Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumented delivery)"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)PREVENTION OF ANESTHESIA MACHINE CONTAMINATION — Preventing contamination of the external parts of the anesthesia machine, its breathing system and ventilator, and its connection to the gas analyzer and attached monitoring equipment while in use for patients with COVID-19 is described in another topic. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Protection of anesthesia equipment'.)Contamination of an anesthesia machine during use as an intensive care ventilator for patients with known COVID-19 infection is more likely than use during a surgical procedure because of the duration and extent of machine exposure. Based on studies of other coronaviruses, it is estimated that infected patients exhale 0 to 100,000 virus particles per 30 minutes, or as many as 4,800,000 particles per day [2]. However, a single filter with a viral filtration efficiency (VFE) of 99.9999 percent (ie, a good mechanical pleated filter at the expiratory limb) would allow 4.8 of these particles, on average, to pass. If two filters are used such as a heat and moisture exchange filter (HMEF) containing an electrostatic filter placed at the airway plus a mechanical pleated filter placed at the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit (figure 1), the combined VFE is very high (perhaps as high as 99.99999999 percent), rendering contamination of the anesthesia machine unlikely, even when used for multiple days (with fresh filters each day). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Contamination of the internal components of the anesthesia machine'.)LOCATIONS FOR ANESTHESIA MACHINES — Location(s) selected for use of anesthesia machines to ventilate COVID-19-positive patients will be institution-dependent due to considerations such as layout of selected hospital area(s), location of rooms with negative pressure capabilities, and availability of sources of electrical power, high-pressure oxygen, and medical air [1,3]. Personnel considerations include availability of anesthesia personnel to manage ventilation with anesthesia machines, and convenience for critical care consultants. When multiple anesthesia machines are used in a single location, the compressed gas pipelines should be assessed to ensure that supply is adequate to meet consumption if supplying an area where multiple anesthesia ventilators are using high fresh gas flows (FGFs). The electrical supply should also be assessed to ensure that circuits will not be overloaded, particularly in areas outside the operating room (OR).Availability of compatible connections from the scavenger system to waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets or medical vacuum outlets is another necessary consideration if inhalation anesthetic agents are to be administered using the anesthesia machine. However, gas scavenging is not necessary if inhalation agents are avoided. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' below and 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below.)Institutional options for location of anesthesia machine ventilators may include intensive care unit (ICU) rooms, the presurgical holding area, post-anesthesia care units (PACUs), or individual ORs [1]. In some institutions, it may be possible to treat two or more COVID-19 patients in the same OR if there are multiple sources of oxygen and medical air, and if anesthesia personnel (ie, anesthesiologists, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists [CRNAs], Certified Anesthesiologist Assistants [CAAs]) are deployed most easily in an OR setting. Notably, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) guidelines for repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation recommend that anesthesia professionals be immediately available at all times to manage and monitor the anesthesia ventilator (and administration of inhalation anesthetic agents, if used), as well as to assist with respiratory care (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator), regardless of the locations(s) for the anesthesia machines [4,5]. (See 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' below and 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' below.) LONG-TERM VENTILATION WITH ANESTHESIA MACHINES — The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidance for anesthesia care team members regarding repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator) [4,5]. These professional societies recommend that anesthesia professionals be immediately available at all times to manage and monitor the anesthesia ventilator. Professional staff who are not anesthesiologists (eg, some intensivists, as well as respiratory therapists, and intensive care unit [ICU] nurses) are experts in respiratory care, but are not familiar with anesthesia machines. Because of the increased amount of interaction required, using anesthesia machine ventilators for patients who require mechanical ventilation for a period of time, but who are not COVID-19-positive, may be a good option for optimal use of institutional resources.Limited data regarding duration of mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 patients suggest that two or more weeks are often necessary. Collaboration with critical care teams throughout this period is clearly essential to achieve optimal respiratory care, and to manage other systemic problems in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.)Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators — Data are limited regarding the capabilities of anesthesia machine ventilators developed by various manufacturers to mimic ICU ventilator parameters or reliably provide continuous mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods of time. Although newer anesthesia ventilators incorporate multiple controlled and assisted modes of ventilation that are nearly identical to intensive care ventilators, there are several important technical issues that are unique to anesthesia machines, which must be considered during use for long-term ventilation.Adjusting humidification of inspired gases●The need to adjust fresh gas flow (FGF) to prevent condensed water accumulation in the breathing circuit [3]. Intensive care ventilators deliver fresh gas during each inspiration, and discharge all exhaled gas into the room. Because compressed gases have zero humidity, active humidification is necessary. The ability to alter FGF and the fraction of exhaled gas rebreathed is a key feature distinguishing an anesthesia ventilator from an ICU ventilator. FGF is typically reduced during general anesthesia to conserve inhalation anesthetic agent. A FGF that is lower than minute ventilation increases rebreathing of exhaled gas, which has been humidified by the body. The reaction of rebreathed carbon dioxide (CO2) with the CO2 absorbent produces additional humidity within the circuit. Experience to date indicates that when an anesthesia machine is in long-term use as an ICU ventilator, reducing FGF leads to excessive humidity in the breathing circuit, and the need to change CO2 absorbent frequently (see ""Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions"", section on 'Carbon dioxide absorbent exhaustion or toxicity'). This additional humidity can be clinically significant leading to water condensation within the breathing circuit that can increase resistance to gas flow through the system, interfere with sensors such as respiratory gas analyzers and flow sensors, and increase risk for coinfections [3]. For these reasons, significant accumulations of water in the breathing circuit (typically expiratory limb) must be emptied. Accumulated water should be emptied carefully and while wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE), because it may be contaminated with virus. Condensers and water traps may be added to some breathing systems to aid in managing excessive humidity [2]. Issues with supply chains have limited purchase of such water traps during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, new options have been designed and tested in some institutions [3].To prevent buildup of humidity and decrease the use of CO2 absorbent, it is recommended that FGF be set to equal minute ventilation initially (approximately 6 to 8 L/minute in adult patients). Generally, it should be apparent in one to two hours if excess moisture is accumulating in the breathing circuit. If it is, FGF can be increased incrementally (eg, by 0.5 to 1 L/min) until humidity is controlled. Alternately, FGF can be set higher (eg, 1.5 times minute ventilation) initially, and can then be reduced in increments of 500 mL/minute with vigilant monitoring for the appearance of humidity in the inspiratory limb. Once FGF exceeds 1.5 times minute ventilation, there is little rebreathing, and increasing FGF further does not provide any advantage and wastes compressed gas (oxygen and medical air).●The need for long-term humidification and warming of inspired gases. Critical care patients should inspire warm humidified gases to prevent drying of secretions and respiratory epithelium. At the low FGFs typically used in the operating room (OR), inspired gas is humidified due to rebreathing [6,7], and also by the release of heat and humidity by the reaction of CO2 with the absorbent [8]. The presence of condensate in the inspiratory hose indicates that the inspired gas relative humidity is >100 percent at room temperature.However, a heat and moisture exchange filter (HMEF) may be necessary when high FGFs are used to prevent condensed water accumulation during prolonged ventilation with an anesthesia machine. The HMEF should be placed at the endotracheal tube connection to the breathing circuit (after the Y-piece and the gas sampling port (figure 1)). This HMEF will ensure that adequate humidity is maintained in the lungs and will also filter viral particles. Filters and HMEFs at the airway are prone to obstruction from moisture or secretions. Compared with the OR setting, obstruction of an airway filter or HMEF placed on an anesthesia machine breathing circuit in the ICU may be less likely to be detected early since there may not be constant attendance by an anesthesia professional. Airway filters and HMEFs should be inspected no less frequently than every hour, and changed when obstruction is a concern, or once every 24 hours. Devices that actively humidify inspired gas are not recommended. They cause problems with ventilation and monitoring since anesthesia machines are not designed to handle large amounts of condensed water within their breathing circuit. Unique safety issues●The need to place a second high-quality viral filter (typically a pleated mechanical filter that does not need heat and humidity exchange properties) on the expiratory limb of an anesthesia machine breathing circuit used for ventilation of a COVID-19 patient, even if a filter or HMEF is placed at the airway (figure 1) (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Contamination of the internal components of the anesthesia machine'). The filter at the expiratory limb can likely be left in place for a longer period of time than the filter placed at the airway; however, there are no data predicting filter performance over time. Since many institutions have filter shortages, these expiratory limb filters should only be changed as necessary.●Potential need to prevent accidental administration of inhalation anesthetic agents. If there are no plans to administer inhalation anesthetics to achieve patient sedation, then the vaporizers for the volatile agents should be removed or drained. Also, the nitrous oxide (N2O) cylinder and pipeline hoses should be removed. These measures ensure that inhalation anesthetic agents are not accidentally administered. However, some institutions with inadequate supplies of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are commonly used in the ICU may consider emergency use of low doses of a volatile inhalation anesthetic agent (isoflurane or sevoflurane), as explained below. (See 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below.)●The potential for the CO2 absorbent to expire. The inspired CO2 and the color indicator of the CO2 absorbent should be monitored frequently. The absorbent should be replaced if inspired CO2 increases (eg, above 5 mmHg) or if the CO2 absorbent color indicates that it has become exhausted. If ventilation must be interrupted to change the absorbent, the patient should be temporarily ventilated by an alternative means. Furthermore, potential reactions with the CO2 absorbent may occur if a volatile anesthetic agent is employed and the absorbent becomes dried by the FGF. (See ""Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions"", section on 'Carbon dioxide absorbent exhaustion or toxicity'.)There are three reasons not to simply remove the CO2 absorber canister, or use an empty absorber canister:•CO2 absorption is important to prevent hypercarbia if FGF decreases below 1 to 1.5 times minute ventilation (purposely or inadvertently).•The breathing system may leak if the canister is removed. The valve installed on some machines to prevent a leak is intended for use for short periods while the canister is being changed, and is not dependable for longer-term use•The canister should not be left empty because that would significantly increase the compliance of the breathing system.●Potential need to adjust the scavenger system of the anesthesia machine. If an anesthesia machine is used outside of an OR, it may not be possible to connect its scavenger system to a compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal or vacuum outlet. Waste anesthetic gas disposal outlets are typically only found in operating or procedure rooms, and waste gas hoses from the anesthesia machine may not be compatible with medical vacuum outlets found elsewhere. Waste anesthetic gas scavenging is only necessary when use of inhalation anesthetic agents is planned (see 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below). Importantly, if a scavenger system with a reservoir bag (closed scavenger system) is not connected to vacuum, it can cause high PEEP and peak pressures due to backup of waste gas into the breathing system. Options include:•If no inhalation anesthetic agents are to be used (picture 1):-Disconnection of the scavenger system from the hoses coming from the breathing system and ventilator -Removal of the scavenger reservoir bag (if it is a closed scavenger system) •If inhalation anesthetic agent will be used, scavenging is required. Connection of the scavenger system to suction in locations outside the OR (eg, the ICU) may be difficult if the connections are incompatible. In such cases, alternate tubing or connectors, or connection adapters may be used. When higher than usual FGFs are used, scavenger suction must be adjusted upward to ensure proper function. ●Potential need to modify oxygen utilization by the anesthesia machine ventilator if institutional oxygen supply is limited by factors such as [3,9]:•Delay in delivery of liquid oxygen to the hospital•Excessive use of oxygen by the hospital, such that the oxygen vaporizers (where liquid oxygen is converted to gas oxygen) become covered in ice, resulting in inefficiency •Inability of the flow in an oxygen pipeline branch to keep up with demand due to caliber of the pipeline, and the number of ventilators, anesthesia machines, and oxygen flowmeters on that branch. This is more typically a problem in some older hospitals.When the oxygen consumption outstrips the maximum oxygen supply, all the ventilators, anesthesia machines, and oxygen flowmeters on that pipeline branch will be affected. Thus, the inspired oxygen concentration delivered by an individual anesthesia machine will decrease if air is being used, and the machine alarm may activate during each inspiratory cycle. Anesthesia machines with bellows ventilators typically use oxygen as the drive gas that compresses the bellows; these ventilators consume oxygen at a rate approximating minute ventilation plus additional oxygen used in the FGF at the rate of FGF times percent oxygen, with sporadic consumption that increases dramatically during inspiration. However, machines with bellows ventilators may be modified by a qualified clinical engineer to be powered by compressed air instead of oxygen [3,9], a modification made that must be made when the machine is not in use (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators).Conversely, anesthesia machines with electrically powered (ie, piston or turbine) ventilators are similar to ICU ventilators, in that they typically consume oxygen at the rate of minute ventilation times percent oxygen, and do not consume oxygen above what is delivered in the fresh gas. ●The need for periodic performance of an anesthesia machine self-test (ie, power-up test) approximately every 24 to 72 hours. The ASA and anesthesia machine manufacturers recommend a pre-use check every day prior to using the machine in the OR setting. For prolonged use, most manufactures have stated that this can be done approximately every three days. Experience has shown that problems such as inaccurate ventilation delivery and monitoring may occur when anesthesia machines are not restarted and checked at three-day intervals.Notably, an alternative means of ventilation is necessary (eg, with a manual resuscitator or a second ventilator) while the machine is powered down, restarted, and checked. A step-by-step procedure should be followed to ensure that all equipment is available to prevent patient lung de-recruitment, as well as to limit spillage of breathing circuit gas and other contaminants and protect anesthesia personnel during this process (refer to APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and the ASA's Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machines as an ICU Ventilator) [4,5]. A suggested procedure has been developed by the APSF and ASA (refer to the APSF/ASA Procedure for Supporting Patients during the Anesthesia Machine Self-Test) [10].●The need to periodically check the breathing circuit for possible kinking or compression since, unlike ICU ventilators, there is no articulating arm on the anesthesia machine that can hold the breathing circuit up off the bed.●The need to minimize potential for errors in setup of anesthesia machines, initiation of controlled ventilation, and respiratory monitoring in locations outside of the OR suite, ideally by deploying multiple machines of the same model within any one hospital unit (eg, ICU, post-anesthesia care unit [PACU]). Adjusting ventilatory settings●The need to understand how specific capabilities differ among individual anesthesia machines:•Newer anesthesia machines have ventilator capabilities similar to modern ICU ventilators, with more flexible settings that can deliver more modes of ventilation (including assist modes) compared with older models. Newer models with compliance compensation and tidal volume delivery unaffected by changes in FGF are generally preferred (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators). •Newer machines are also equipped with breathing systems and ventilators that can be sterilized between patients, and are better choices for those with COVID-19 infection.•Older models can be reserved for surgical patients and for ventilation of patients without COVID-19 respiratory disease, if feasible.●The need to understand how settings and performance of anesthesia machine ventilators differ from those of ICU ventilators when making adjustments in ventilator settings:•Anesthesia machines do not default to pressure support of extra breaths in control modes. Care must be taken to add this when changing ventilator modes.•Anesthesia machines may have a lower peak inspiratory flow rate. Negative airway pressure occurs if the patient inhales faster than the maximum inspiratory flow rate provided by the ventilator.•Anesthesia machines are milliseconds slower to respond to patient effort because of the circle breathing system interposed between the patient and anesthesia ventilator [11], which can cause more hyperventilation in an air-hungry patient.•Inspiratory time is not directly set on an anesthesia machine. Most anesthesia machines do not provide direct control of inspiratory time; instead this is controlled indirectly by setting the I:E ratio and the respiratory rate.Options for setting the anesthesia machine ventilator include:-In volume control modes (including synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation [SIMV]), the inspiratory flow rate can be increased by increasing tidal volume or by decreasing inspiratory time (accomplished by reducing the I:E ratio or by increasing the respiratory rate). Introducing an inspiratory pause (Tpause or TIP) will also increase the inspiratory flow rate during the active portion of inspiration, before the pause.-In pressure control or support modes, the inspiratory flow rate can be increased by lowering the flow trigger level for ventilation (which also increases the speed at which pressure-support is provided), or by decreasing the rise time of pressure support (which increases the inspiratory flow rate). On Draeger anesthesia machine ventilators, the flow trigger level is called ""Trigger L/min"" and the rise time is called ""Tslope."" On GE Healthcare Systems anesthesia machine ventilators, the flow trigger level is called ""Flow Trigger"" and the rise time is called ""Rise Rate."" However, lowering the flow trigger level may cause extra mis-triggered breaths in some patients; if these occur, the flow trigger level must be increased. On some Draeger machine ventilators, the maximum inspiratory flow is governed by a facility-level setting, although on-site clinical engineers can adjust this parameter to allow a maximum inspiratory flow of 75 L/min.●Potential need to modify default ventilator parameters and alarm settings. Default settings on the anesthesia machine, such as minute ventilation, airway pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels, and alarms, may be modified to better match those of an ICU ventilator. The default alarm volumes should be set to maximum.●The potential for the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration in the breathing circuit to be lower than the set oxygen gas concentration on the anesthesia machine (FgO2), especially at lower FGFs. Because of the rebreathing that occurs in an anesthesia machine circle breathing circuit, inspired oxygen concentration depends on both the ratio of oxygen to air in the delivered fresh gas (determined by the FGF setting) and the total FGF (which influences the amount of rebreathing). Thus, inspired oxygen concentration must be continuously monitored (see 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' below). ●Notably, when total FGF is very high (eg, >12 L/minute), a FiO2 of 100 percent cannot be delivered if the total FGF is higher than the maximum possible flow of oxygen. For instance, if a total FGF of 15 L/minute is necessary, and the maximum oxygen flow is only 12 L/min, then 3 L/min of air must be added. This may be confusing on anesthesia machines that have controls for total FGF and for oxygen percent.Monitoring long-term ventilation — An anesthesia professional should be available to start ventilation and subsequently monitor degree of moisture accumulation, inspired and expired CO2, filter integrity, overall anesthesia machine function, and effectiveness of ventilation [1]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.) The APSF/ASA guidelines address additional maintenance and monitoring requirements during use of anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation of COVID-19 patients (refer to APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions - Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator) [4,5]. These additional considerations are necessary due to use of extra filters which may become clogged, the tendency to accumulate condensed water in the breathing circuit, and risks for aerosolizing droplets containing COVID-19 virus.Documentation of this enhanced monitoring of continuous and intermittent parameters is necessary. This may be achieved automatically if the anesthesia machine connected to the hospital network for recording to the electronic medical record [1], or manually using a template developed for this purpose by the anesthesia team.Patient monitoring — Baseline monitored parameters (eg, tidal volume, plateau pressure [Pplat], minute ventilation) should be recorded when ventilation is initiated. If spirometry is available, saving or photographing the baseline tracings and reference loops may aid in later diagnosis of filter obstructions.Continuously monitored parameters (with preset alarms) that are checked and recorded each hour include:●Inspired oxygen concentration. ●Inspired and expired CO2.●Inspiratory pressure.●Tidal volume and respiratory rate. ●Low oxygen pressure alarm. If an anesthesia machines with an oxygen-driven bellows is being used, a low oxygen pressure alarm triggered by each inspiration may indicate a high demand on the institutional central oxygen pipeline system, particularly when multiple ventilators are simultaneously in use. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)Intermittently monitored ventilatory and physiologic parameters include:●Check Pplat at least once every four hours, and after each change in PEEP or tidal volume, to ensure that it is ≤30 cm H2O. Measurement of Pplat is accomplished during a 0.5 second inspiratory pause. Unlike many ICU ventilators, anesthesia machines do not have a control to manually initiate an inspiratory pause. On an anesthesia machine ventilator, a 0.5 second inspiratory pause can be generated by temporarily setting the mode to volume ventilation with the tidal volume that the patient has been receiving, at 10 breaths per minute, with an I:E ratio of 1:2 and a 50 percent inspiratory pause (Tpause or TIP). (See 'Adjusting ventilatory settings' above.)●Check the flow readings approximately every four hours, since these may become less accurate over time. If the machine is equipped with both inspiratory and expiratory flow sensors, a gradual increase in the difference between inspired and exhaled tidal volume measurements usually indicates that a startup test is needed to recalibrate the breathing system flow sensors.●Confirm there is no leak around the endotracheal tube cuff every hour because such a leak produces respiratory droplets and aerosolized viral particles. A leak around the endotracheal tube cuff typically manifests as measured exhaled tidal volume that is lower than measured inhaled tidal volume, and a flow-volume loop that does not close [12]. At low FGFs a bellows ventilator may progressively empty, while the reservoir bag will progressively deflate in machines with a piston or turbine ventilator. High FGF compensates for small leaks, obscuring these indicators of breathing circuit volume.Machine maintenance and monitoring — Intermittent inspection and maintenance of proper anesthesia machine and breathing circuit function including:●Inspect the breathing circuit hoses and water trap for excessive condensed water every hour. An oscillating obstructive gas flow tracing during exhalation indicates condensed water accumulation in the expiratory, scavenger, or ventilator hose. An oscillating obstructive gas flow tracing during inhalation indicates condensed water accumulation in the inspiratory or ventilator hose.If fluid has accumulated in the breathing circuit and is threatening to impede ventilation, it must be removed [3]. Plans should be in place to ventilate the patient while the circuit is emptied. One novel method that has been described is placement of an airway filter casing with a Luer connector in the expiratory limb to serve as a water trap, enabling aspiration of condensed water by syringe without interrupting ventilation [3]. Further, proper collection and disposal procedures for contaminated water and PPE for personnel performing this procedure are necessary since the fluid being removed may be contaminated with virus.●Inspect the breathing circuit hoses for possible kinking or compression every hour as well.●Inspect the airway and expiratory limb breathing circuit filters every hour to check for excessive humidity or secretions that may cause obstruction of gas flow. The airway filter is at highest risk (figure 1). Obstructed filters must be changed. Otherwise, filters are typically replaced every 24 hours. High peak airway pressure during volume ventilation or low tidal volume during pressure ventilation are signs of profound obstruction of the filters placed at the airway or in the expiratory limb (figure 1) [3]. Decreased peak expiratory flow and prolongation of expiratory flow are earlier indications of partial obstruction of one of these filters [12]. Significant obstruction of either filter also creates additional PEEP, with a difference between the set and actual PEEP that can be seen in the airway pressure when the expiratory limb filter is obstructed. Notably, this additional PEEP is invisible when the airway filter is obstructed since airway pressure is measured downstream of that filter. ●Check the CO2 absorbent color and inspired CO2 values every hour to ensure that the absorbent is still functioning properly and does not need to be exchanged. This is especially important if lower FGFs are being used.●Confirm that an anesthesia machine startup test was performed once every 24 to 72 hours (refer to the APSF/ASA Procedure for Supporting Patients during the Anesthesia Machine Self-Test) [10]. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)USE OF INHALATION ANESTHETICS FOR SEDATION — During the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation may lead some institutions to consider using low doses of a potent volatile inhalation anesthetic agent (isoflurane or sevoflurane) [13]. Compared with other critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 have higher sedation requirements that may be due to their younger age, higher respiratory drive, and a particularly intense inflammatory response [14,15]. Although we are not recommending routine administration of inhalation anesthetic agents to critically ill patients for prolonged periods due to scant safety data in this setting, as well as some disadvantages (see 'Advantages and disadvantages' below), the ready availability of these agents is an advantage when anesthesia machines are used to provide mechanical ventilation. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Sedation and analgesia'.)The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidelines for such emergency use (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [16].Intravenous sedative-analgesic regimens that are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation are discussed in separate topics:●(See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal"".)●(See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects"".)●(See ""Pain control in the critically ill adult patient"".)Dosing to achieve sedation — Administration of low doses of either sevoflurane (eg, 0.5 to 1.4 percent) or isoflurane (eg, 0.2 to 0.7 percent) for long-term sedation is reasonable if use of a volatile inhalation anesthetic agent becomes necessary.Factors influencing dosing include whether the targeted level of sedation is achieved with satisfactory patient comfort. The presence of ventilator dyssynchrony may necessitate deepening the anesthetic/sedation level. Conversely, if hypotension is present, lightening of the anesthetic/sedation level is necessary. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Clinical effects'.)When the decision is made to allow the patient to awaken, the anesthetic vaporizer is turned off, and fresh gas flow (FGF) is increased. Washout of anesthetic agent is rapid and predictable, with patients typically able to respond to commands and be assessed for extubation within 10 to 15 minutes. (See ""Emergence from general anesthesia"", section on 'Inhalation agents'.)Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics — In addition to the suggested monitoring noted above for use of anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation (see 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above), specialized monitoring requiring the constant presence of an anesthesia provider is necessary during administration of inhalation anesthetic agents.Patient monitoring during sedation●Continuously monitored parameters include:•End-tidal anesthetic concentration, with titration of anesthetic dosing to the minimal effective end-tidal concentration. The low-level and high-level alarms on the anesthetic gas monitor should be enabled.•Exhaled end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) to monitor for the possibility of malignant hyperthermia (which severely and acutely increases ETCO2), and to help manage ventilation. (See 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above.)•Temperature, since potent inhalation anesthetics lower core temperatures (see ""Perioperative temperature management"", section on 'Anesthetic effects on thermoregulation'), and to monitor for the possibility of malignant hyperthermia (which acutely increases temperature to >102°F [38.9°C).●Other monitored parameters include:•Hemodynamic monitoring per usual standards for care of individual critically ill patients, and may be useful to evaluate cardiovascular responses to an inhalation anesthetic agent. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Hemodynamic monitoring' and ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Cardiovascular effects'.)•Serum creatinine and liver function tests are obtained at intervals that may be daily (in consultation with the critical care team), as a check for renal or hepatic dysfunction during long-term administration of a volatile anesthetic agent.Equipment monitoring during sedation — Intermittent inspection and maintenance of anesthetic administration includes:●The fill level of anesthetic vaporizers is checked every hour since rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents occurs due to high FGF; refill when anesthetic level <20 percent full.Liquid anesthetic use can be estimated. One mL of a liquid volatile anesthetic agent yields approximately 200 mL of gas anesthetic (specific values are 195 mL for isoflurane or 184 mL for sevoflurane). Thus, at 10 L/min of FGF, the liquid volatile anesthetic consumption is approximately 30 mL/hour if a 1 percent inhaled concentration is delivered. Most vaporizers hold approximately 200 ml of liquid, so refills would be needed multiple times each day even at the lower doses noted above for use of isoflurane or sevoflurane for patient sedation during mechanical ventilation. (See 'Dosing to achieve sedation' above.)One way to reduce consumption of volatile anesthetic agent is to reduce FGF. Another way to agent consumption is to use an anesthetic reflector device such as the AnaConDa or Mirus [17-22]. These devices are designed for administration of inhalation anesthetic agents using a traditional intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator, but are not approved for use in the United States. The device is placed between the Y-piece and patient, where it vaporizes small amounts of anesthetic liquid, and absorbs most of the exhaled anesthetic, which is then re-inhaled on the next breath (much like a heat and moisture exchanger [HME] absorbs and conserves humidity). Notably, room contamination still occurs with use of these devices unless a scavenging system is employed [20-22]. ●Proper functioning of the scavenging system is confirmed when administration of inhalation anesthetics is initiated, then every 24 hours or after major changes in the rate of FGF. Anesthetic vapor is consumed rapidly and the scavenger system requires high vacuum flow when high FGF is used. Advantages and disadvantages — Advantages and disadvantages of specific agents (sevoflurane versus isoflurane) are discussed separately. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Sevoflurane' and ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Isoflurane'.)Potential advantages and disadvantages for long-term use of sevoflurane or isoflurane for sedation of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 induced respiratory failure include:●Advantages•Effective sedative effects, with rapid onset and offset allowing easy titratability. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Sedation and anesthesia'.)•Minimal metabolism and likely minimal organ toxicity. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Properties and delivery"", section on 'Metabolism'.)•Ready availability during shortages of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are usually employed for sedation during mechanical ventilation [13]. Reports of unusually high sedation requirements in many COVID-19 patients may contribute to shortages of multiple commonly used intravenous agents [13,14]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Sedation and analgesia'.).•Potentially advantageous respiratory effects-Bronchodilation, with attenuation of bronchospasm and decreased airway responsiveness. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Respiratory effects'.)-Pulmonary anti-inflammatory effects (eg, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine release) that may minimize the extent of lung injury [23-27]. (See ""One lung ventilation: General principles"", section on 'Intravenous versus inhalation anesthetics'.)•Dose-dependent muscle relaxation during mechanical ventilation. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Skeletal and smooth muscle relaxation'.)●Disadvantages•Scant safety data regarding use of inhalation anesthetic agents for prolonged periods in critically ill patients. However, long-term sedation with sevoflurane or isoflurane has been employed in some nations for sedation of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other critical illness, without evidence of renal or hepatic injury [26-30].•Rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents occurs due to high FGF. Thus, hourly inspection of the anesthetic vaporizer fill level and analysis of end-tidal anesthetic concentration are particularly important. (See 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' above.)•Potential for inadequate sedation due to a vaporizer running dry, particularly if the patient has received a neuromuscular blocking agent. Thus, the patient and anesthesia machine and anesthetic vaporizer must be carefully monitored. •Potential difficulty with connection of the anesthesia machine scavenger systems to compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets in settings outside an operating room (OR). (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)•Lack of familiarity among non-anesthesia personnel caring for critically ill patients with ARDS (eg, intensivists, nurses, respiratory therapists) regarding use of anesthesia machines to administer volatile inhalation anesthetic agents, dosing of these agents, and potential pitfalls that may occur during their administration (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [16]. •Need for constant presence of anesthesia personnel as recommended by the ASA and APSF (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [16].  •Potentially undesirable systemic effects of a potent volatile anesthetic agent in critically ill patients, including:-Cardiovascular effects (eg, myocardial depression and vasodilatory properties that result in dose-dependent reductions in blood pressure and cardiac output). (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Cardiovascular effects'.)-Adverse respiratory effects including airway irritation, particularly with the more pungent agents such as isoflurane, as well as respiratory depression. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Respiratory effects'.)-Cerebral effects (eg, dose-dependent cerebral vasodilation, with blunting of cerebral autoregulation by uncoupling cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism, thereby increasing CBF and intracranial pressure (ICP). Thus, patients with known or suspected elevations in ICP are not candidates for sedation with inhalation anesthetic agents. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Effects on cerebral physiology'.)•Although rare, potential for potent inhalation anesthetic agents to cause malignant hyperthermia. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Malignant hyperthermia (volatile inhalation agents)'.)COLLABORATION WITH CRITICAL CARE CONSULTANTS — Collaboration and coordination with critical care clinicians is essential for care of COVID-19 patients regarding the initial decision to use an anesthesia machine, and for management of long-term ventilation and comorbidities in each critically ill COVID-19 patient (eg, cardiovascular and renal complications, coinfection with sepsis) [31-35]. These issues are discussed in detail in separate topics:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Contamination of an anesthesia machine, its breathing system and ventilator, and its connected gas analyzer is more likely during use as an intensive care ventilator compared with use during surgical procedures for patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or nCoV) infection because of the duration and extent of machine exposure. However, if two filters are used (eg, a heat and moisture exchange filter [HMEF] containing an electrostatic filter placed at the airway plus a mechanical pleated filter placed at the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit), the combined viral filtration efficiency (VFE) is very high, rendering contamination of the anesthesia machine unlikely, even when used for multiple days (with fresh filters each day). (See 'Prevention of anesthesia machine contamination' above.)●Locations selected for use of anesthesia machines to ventilate COVID-19 patients will be institution-dependent depending on layout of selected hospital area(s), location of rooms with negative pressure capabilities, availability of sources of high-pressure oxygen and medical air, availability of compatible connections from the scavenger system to waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets when inhalation anesthetic agents are used, and availability of anesthesia personnel to manage the anesthesia machines. (See 'Locations for anesthesia machines' above.)●The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidance for repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator). Although newer anesthesia ventilators incorporate multiple controlled and assisted modes of ventilation that are nearly identical to ventilators in the intensive care unit (ICU), several important technical issues are unique to anesthesia machines during such use (see 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above):•The age and specific capabilities of individual anesthesia machines (newer anesthesia machines have more flexible capabilities and can deliver more modes of ventilation).•The need to adjust fresh gas flow (FGF) to prevent condensed water accumulation in the breathing circuit.•The need for long-term humification and warming of inspired gases.•The need for two high-quality viral filters (one at the airway and on the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit (figure 1)).•The need to understand how settings and performance of anesthesia machine ventilators can be different from those of ICU ventilators.•Potential need to modify default ventilator parameters and alarm settings.•The potential for the carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbent to expire.•The potential for the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration in the breathing circuit to be lower than the set oxygen gas concentration on the anesthesia machine (FgO2).•The need to prevent accidental administration of inhalation anesthetic agents, if inhalation anesthetics are not administered to achieve patient sedation.•Potential need to adjust the scavenger system to prevent backpressure in the breathing system if the anesthesia machine is used outside of an operating room (OR).•The need for periodic performance of an anesthesia machine self-test (ie, power-up test) approximately every 24 to 72 hours.•The need to periodically check the breathing circuit for possible kinking or compression.•The need to minimize potential for errors in setup of anesthesia machines, initiation of controlled ventilation, and respiratory monitoring in locations outside the OR, ideally by deploying multiple machines of the same model within any one hospital unit.●An anesthesia professional should be available to start and monitor ventilation and overall anesthesia machine function (see 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above):•Continuously or intermittently monitored patient parameters (with preset alarms) that are checked and recorded each hour include (see 'Patient monitoring' above):-Inspired oxygen concentration -Inspired and expired CO2-Inspiratory pressure-Tidal volume and respiratory rate-Low oxygen pressure alarm-Check Pplat at least once every four hours, and after each change in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or tidal volume-Check the flow readings approximately every four hours -Confirm there is no leak around the endotracheal tube cuff every hour •Intermittently machine monitoring includes inspection of (see 'Machine maintenance and monitoring' above):-Breathing circuit hoses and water trap for excessive condensed water every hour.-Breathing circuit hoses for possible kinking or compression every hour-Airway and expiratory limb breathing circuit filters every hour for excessive humidity or secretions-CO2 absorbent color and inspired CO2 values every hour -Documentation of anesthesia machine startup test performance once every 24 to 72 hours ●Although intravenous sedative-analgesic regimens are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation, institutions with shortages of these intravenous agents may consider using low doses of a potent volatile inhalation anesthetic agent for long-term sedation (ie, sevoflurane [0.5 to 1.4%] or isoflurane [0.2 to 0.7%]; refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients).

The World Health Organization has designated the disease caused by the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Individuals with COVID-19 may have a number of coagulation abnormalities (in the direction of an underlying hypercoagulable state), raising questions about appropriate evaluations and interventions to prevent or treat thrombosis. Interim guidance has been published by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), and frequently asked questions are posted on the websites of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC).This topic reviews evaluation and management of coagulation abnormalities in individuals with COVID-19.Separate topics discuss the following:●General management – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●Critical care – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)●Pregnancy – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●Anesthesia – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is incompletely understood.Virchow's triad — Hypercoagulability can be thought of in terms of Virchow's triad (see ""Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis"", section on 'Virchow's triad'). All three of the major contributions to clot formation apply to severe COVID-19 infection:●Endothelial injury – There is evidence of direct invasion of endothelial cells by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, potentially leading to cell injury. Other sources of endothelial injury include intravascular catheters and mediators of the acute systemic inflammatory response such as cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-6) and other acute phase reactants [1]. The contribution of complement-mediated endothelial injury has been suggested [2]. (See ""The endothelium: A primer"" and ""Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention"" and ""Acute phase reactants"".)●Stasis – Immobilization can cause stasis of blood flow in all hospitalized and critically ill patients, regardless of whether they have COVID-19.●Hypercoagulable state – A number of changes in circulating prothrombotic factors have been reported or proposed in patients with severe COVID-19 [3,4]:•Elevated factor VIII •Elevated fibrinogen•Circulating prothrombotic microparticles•Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)Very elevated levels of D-dimer have been observed that correlate with illness severity; D-dimer is a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin indicating augmented thrombin generation and fibrin dissolution by plasmin. However, high D-dimer levels are common in acutely ill individuals with a number of infectious and inflammatory diseases. Likewise, antiphospholipid antibodies, which can prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), are common in viral infections, but they are often transient and do not always imply an increased risk of thrombosis. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' below and 'Clinical features' below.) Coagulation abnormalities — The predominant coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 suggest a hypercoagulable state and are consistent with uncontrolled clinical observations of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (see 'VTE' below). This state has been termed thromboinflammation or COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) by some experts [5,6]. It appears to be distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), though DIC has been reported in severely affected patients.Laboratory findings were characterized in a series of 24 selected patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (intubated) who were evaluated along with standard coagulation testing and other assays including von Willebrand factor (VWF) and thromboelastography (TEG) [3]:●Coagulation testing•Prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT normal or slightly prolonged•Platelet counts normal or increased (mean, 348,000/microL)•Fibrinogen increased (mean, 680 mg/dL; range 234 to 1344)•D-dimer increased (mean, 4877 ng/mL; range, 1197 to 16,954)●Other assays•Factor VIII activity increased (mean, 297 units/dL)•VWF antigen greatly increased (mean, 529; range 210 to 863), consistent with endothelial injury or perturbation•Minor changes in natural anticoagulants-Small decreases in antithrombin and free protein S-Small increase in protein C ●TEG findings•Reaction time (R) shortened, consistent with increased early thrombin burst, in 50 percent of patients•Clot formation time (K) shortened, consistent with increased fibrin generation, in 83 percent•Maximum amplitude (MA) increased, consistent with greater clot strength, in 83 percent•Clot lysis at 30 minutes (LY30) reduced, consistent with reduced fibrinolysis, in 100 percentTesting in this study was performed on arterial blood because the patients had arterial catheters in place, but venous blood can be used. Heparinase was included since most patients were receiving low molecular weight (LMW) heparin. Other studies have reported similar findings consistent with a hypercoagulable state, including very high D-dimer, VWF antigen and activity, and factor VIII activity [4,7]. One study suggested that patients with COVID-19 have higher platelet counts than patients with other coronavirus infections [8]. Early case series, including a series of 183 consecutive patients from Wuhan, China, suggested that thrombocytopenia and prolongation of the PT and aPTT were more marked [9-12]. It is not clear why these results differed somewhat from later findings of less severe PT and aPTT prolongation. One possible explanation is that these patients were sicker, perhaps because earlier in the pandemic the disease was not recognized as quickly, resulting in delays in patient presentation and/or treatment.Another explanation for an isolated prolonged aPTT is the presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LA) (see ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Causes of prolonged aPTT'). Two studies have found a high rate of LA in patients with prolonged aPTT (50 of 57 tested individuals [88 percent] and 31 of 34 tested individuals [91 percent]) [13,14]. The presence of an LA may lead to an artifactual prolongation of the aPTT but does not reflect an increased bleeding risk; patients with an LA should receive anticoagulation if indicated. (See 'Management' below.) Some of the markers of deranged coagulation (eg, D-dimer) appear to correlate with illness severity. D-dimer is often increased, sometimes markedly, in individuals with overt DIC and those in the intensive care unit (ICU). Principles of TEG and interpretation of TEG tracings are illustrated in the figure (figure 1) and discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Platelet function testing"", section on 'Thromboelastography (TEG) and ROTEM' and ""Acute coagulopathy associated with trauma"", section on 'Thromboelastography'.)Distinction from DIC — The hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 has been referred to by some as a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like state, especially because many affected individuals are acutely ill and meet criteria for probable DIC in a scoring system published by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) in 2009 [15]. However, the major clinical finding in COVID-19 is thrombosis, whereas the major finding in acute decompensated DIC is bleeding.Likewise, COVID-19 has some similar laboratory findings to DIC, including a marked increase in D-dimer and in some cases, mild thrombocytopenia. However, other coagulation parameters in COVID-19 are distinct from DIC. In COVID-19, the typical findings include high fibrinogen and high factor VIII activity, suggesting that major consumption of coagulation factors is not occurring [3]. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above.)In contrast, acute decompensated DIC is associated with low fibrinogen due to consumption of clotting factors. In one of the largest series that reported on thromboembolic events, none of the patients developed overt DIC [16].Typically, bleeding predominates in acute decompensated DIC and thrombosis predominates in chronic compensated DIC, although there is significant overlap. Thus, the hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 is more similar to compensated DIC than to acute DIC. However, in COVID-19, the platelet count and aPTT are typically normal. (See ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Pathogenesis'.)This ISTH scoring system is based on laboratory findings and is only intended for use in patients with an underlying condition known to be associated with DIC [15]. COVID-19 would qualify based on being a severe infection. Points are given for thrombocytopenia (1 point for platelet count 50,000 to 100,000/microL; 2 points for <50,000/microL), prolonged PT (1 point for 3 to 6 seconds of prolongation; 2 points for more than 6 seconds), low fibrinogen (1 point for <100 mg/dL), and increased D-dimer (2 points for moderate increase; 3 points for ""strong"" increase). A score of 5 or more points suggests DIC is probable. Despite this, the diagnosis of DIC is made clinically; there is no gold standard and no single test or combination of tests that is pathognomonic. Compared with expert opinion, the ISTH scoring system is reported to have a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 97 percent [15]. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above.)Regardless of whether the differences from DIC or the similarities are emphasized, many of the basic principles of DIC management apply, including the importance of treating the underlying condition, the importance of basing interventions on the clinical picture rather than on laboratory testing alone, and the need to provide anticoagulation for thrombosis and appropriate hemostatic therapies for bleeding. (See ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Treatment'.)CLINICAL FEATURESVTE — Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is very common in acutely ill patients with COVID-19, seen in up to one-third of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), even when prophylactic anticoagulation is used. Two autopsy studies emphasize the contributions of hypercoagulability and associated inflammation in patients who die from COVID-19:●Post-mortem examination of 21 individuals with COVID-19 found prominent PE in four, with microthrombi in alveolar capillaries in 5 of 11 (45 percent) who had available histology [17]. Three had evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy with fibrin thrombi in glomerular capillaries. The average age was 76 years, and most had a high body mass index (BMI; mean, 31 kg/m2; normal 18.5 to <25). Information on use of anticoagulation prior to death was available for 11, and all 11 were receiving some form of anticoagulation. Underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were common.●Post-mortem examination of 12 consecutive individuals with COVID-19 (8 male; 10 hospitalized) revealed DVT in 7 of 12 (58 percent) [18]. All cases of DVT had bilateral leg involvement, and none were suspected before death. Of the 12 for whom lung histology was available, 5 (42 percent) had evidence of thrombosis. PE was the cause of death in four. In those who had D-dimer testing, some had extremely high values (two >20,000 ng/mL and one >100,000 ng/mL; normal value <500 ng/mL [<500 mcg/L]). Use of anticoagulation prior to death was only reported in 4 of the 12. The mean BMI was 28.7 kg/m2; only three patients had a normal BMI, and they had cancer, ulcerative colitis, and/or chronic kidney disease. Both of these studies noted the preponderance of males with a high prevalence of obesity and other chronic medical comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. ICU — Case series of intensive care unit (ICU) patients have reported high rates of VTE (range, 20 to 43 percent), mostly pulmonary embolism (PE), and often despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation: ●A series of 184 sequential patients with severe COVID-19 in the ICU reported PE in 25 (14 percent), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 1, and catheter-associated thrombosis in 2 [16]. The cumulative incidence of VTE (based on different durations of follow-up) was calculated at 27 percent. All were receiving at least standard dose thromboprophylaxis. The group as a whole was very ill, with 13 percent requiring renal replacement therapy and 13 percent mortality. Three-fourths of the patients were male, and several had active cancer (independent VTE risk factors). ●A series of 150 ICU patients reported VTE in 64 (43 percent, mostly PE) and clotting of the extracorporeal circuit in 28 of 29 receiving continuous renal replacement therapy and 2 of 12 undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [7]. All patients were receiving thromboprophylaxis (mostly low molecular weight [LMW] heparin), 70 percent with prophylactic dose and 30 percent with therapeutic dose. This study also compared the subgroup of 77 patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to a matched cohort of 145 patients with non-COVID-19-ARDS and found the rate of thrombotic complications (mostly PE) to be higher in the COVID-19 patients (12 versus 2 percent).●A series of 107 ICU patients reported PE in 22 (21 percent; cumulative incidence at 15 days, 20 percent) [19]. Of the 22 patients with PE, 20 were receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 2 were receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (for prior VTE and atrial fibrillation). By comparison, the incidence of PE in two matched cohorts (one from the same time interval in the previous year and one from concurrent patients with influenza rather than COVID-19) were 6 and 8 percent, respectively.●A series that included 74 ICU patients reported VTE in 29 (39 percent), with a cumulative incidence of 25 percent at 7 days and 48 percent at 14 days [20]. All of these individuals were receiving anticoagulation, most at prophylactic levels. None of the patients receiving therapeutic level anticoagulation at admission developed VTE.●An earlier series of 81 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia reported VTE in 20 (25 percent) [21].●A study that performed screening leg ultrasounds in 26 individuals with COVID-19 in the ICU who were all receiving either prophylactic-dose or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation found VTE in 18 (69 percent), including bilateral clots in 10 (38 percent) [22]. Some of these individuals had additional VTE risk factors including cancer, recent surgery, high BMI, or prior VTE; 7 (27 percent) were receiving anticoagulation prior to admission.VTE risk is in the range where some experts would suggest more aggressive thromboprophylaxis dosing of anticoagulants or even empiric therapeutic-dose anticoagulation for VTE prevention. Some of these studies noted a higher than average body mass index in affected individuals, suggesting that obesity, along with other risk factors, may warrant consideration in decision-making regarding the intensity of anticoagulation. (See 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below.)Inpatients (non-ICU) — Data are more limited regarding the rate of VTE in inpatients who are not in the intensive care unit (ICU). The series with a 39 percent rate of VTE in ICU patients above also included 124 non-ICU patients, and of those, only 4 (3 percent) were diagnosed with VTE [20].A series from Ireland that included 50 patients on the regular medical ward reported similar findings to those in ICU patients, including high D-dimer and fibrinogen and normal platelet counts and clotting times [23]. Outpatients — We are aware that thrombotic events have been observed in COVID-19 patients who were not admitted to the hospital, but data on the incidence are not available. Arterial events — There are also reports of arterial thrombosis, including in the central nervous system (CNS). As examples:●CNS – A single health system identified five cases of acute ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19 over a two-week period, with symptoms suggesting large-vessel occlusion; all patients were under 50 years of age [24]. In other time periods before the pandemic, there were approximately 0.7 large vessel strokes per two-week interval in individuals under age 50. In one of the series of ICU patients discussed above, ischemic stroke was observed in 3 of 184 (cumulative incidence, 3.7 percent) [16]. In another one of the series discussed above, cerebral ischemia was seen in 3 of 150 [7].●Limbs – A report described 20 patients with COVID-19 who developed acute limb ischemia at a single institution over a three-month period [25]. This represented a significant increase in limb ischemia over the previous year (16 percent, versus 2 percent in early 2019). Most were male (18 of 20), and the average age was 75 years. Surgical revascularization procedures were performed in 17, of which 12 (71 percent) were successful, a lower-than-expected success rate. Individuals who received postoperative heparin did not require reintervention, although the benefits of postoperative heparin did not reach statistical significance. Another report described four patients with acute limb ischemia due to thrombosis, two of whom were young and did not have any comorbidities (a 53-year-old man who developed aorto-iliac thrombosis and a 37-year-old man who developed humeral artery thrombosis) [26]. Both were receiving prophylactic-dose LMW heparin at the time thrombosis developed and both had very high D-dimer (>9000 ng/mL). Myocardial infarction has also been reported but not emphasized in available series.Microvascular thrombosis — Autopsy studies in some individuals who have died from COVID-19 have demonstrated microvascular thrombosis in the lungs [2,6]. The mechanism is unclear and may involve hypercoagulability, direct endothelial injury, complement activation, or other processes. In the absence of more definitive data regarding mechanisms or therapy, we would not pursue specialized testing for thrombotic microangiopathies (eg, ADAMTS13 activity, complement studies) or specialized therapies (eg, plasma exchange, anti-complement therapy) outside of a research study.Bleeding — Bleeding is less common than clotting in patients with COVID-19, but it may occur, especially in the setting of anticoagulation. As an example, in a subset of 25 ICU patients who were evaluated for abnormal neurologic findings, one had evidence of intracranial hemorrhage as well as ischemic lesions [7]. Three other patients in this series also had hemorrhagic complications, including two intracerebral bleeds associated with head trauma and one with hemorrhagic complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Three others in this series had evidence of intracerebral ischemia. (See 'Arterial events' above.)EVALUATION — The evaluation of patients with COVID-19 and coagulation abnormalities (suspected or documented) can be challenging due to the limited data on which clinical parameters or coagulation abnormalities should be acted upon and the concerns related to performing diagnostic imaging procedures on acutely ill and potentially contagious patients. A general approach is as follows, although other decisions may be made by the treating clinicians based on their evaluation of the patient. This approach is consistent with guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the American Society of Hematology (ASH), and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) [5,27,28]. Routine testing (all patients)●Inpatients – We assess the following in inpatients with COVID-19:•Complete blood count (CBC) including platelet count•Coagulation studies (prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT])•Fibrinogen•D-dimerRepeat testing is reasonable on a daily basis or less frequently, depending on the acuity of the patient's illness, the initial result, and the trend in values. Measurement of the D-dimer more than once per day is generally not indicated.As noted above, common laboratory findings include (see 'Coagulation abnormalities' above):•High D-dimer •High fibrinogen•Normal or mildly prolonged PT and aPTT•Mild thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, or normal platelet countWe do not intervene for these abnormal coagulation studies in the absence of clinical indications. However, these findings may have prognostic value and may impact decision-making about the level of care and/or investigational therapies directed at treating the infection. As an example, increasing D-dimer is associated with poor prognosis. (See 'Investigational therapies' below.)Atypical findings such as a markedly prolonged aPTT (out of proportion to the PT), low fibrinogen, or severe thrombocytopenia suggest that another condition may be present and additional evaluation may be indicated. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)We do not routinely test for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), other thrombotic microangiopathies, or antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). There are no therapeutic implications of transiently positive aPL in the absence of clinical findings. Transient aPL positivity is often seen in acute infections. (See ""Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome"", section on 'Other conditions associated with aPL'.)We do not routinely perform imaging for screening purposes, as there is no evidence that indicates this practice improves outcomes, and it may unnecessarily expose health care workers to additional infectious risks. However, imaging is appropriate in individuals with symptoms, as discussed below. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)●Outpatients – For outpatients, routine coagulation testing is not required. Evaluation of abnormal symptoms or findings on examination is similar to inpatients. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)Role of additional testingDiagnosis of DVT or PE — Evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) may be challenging because symptoms of PE overlap with COVID-19, and imaging studies may not be feasible in all cases. The threshold for evaluation or diagnosis of DVT or PE should be low given the high frequency of these events and the presence of additional venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factors in many individuals. (See 'VTE' above.) ●DVT – Individuals with suspected DVT should have compression ultrasonography when feasible according to standard indications. (See ""Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity"".)●PE – We agree with guidance from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) regarding diagnosis of PE, which includes the following [29]:•A normal D-dimer is sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of PE. An increase in D-dimer is not specific for VTE and is not sufficient to make the diagnosis.•In patients with suspected PE due to unexplained hypotension, tachycardia, worsening respiratory status, or other risk factors for thrombosis, computed tomography with pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred test to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is an alternative if CTPA cannot be performed or is inconclusive, although V/Q scan may be unhelpful in individuals with significant pulmonary involvement from COVID-19. Consultation with the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) in decision-making is advised if possible. (See ""Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism"".)The role of full-dose anticoagulation if CTPA or V/Q scan is not feasible is discussed below. (See 'Documented or presumed VTE' below.)Infection control procedures should be followed in patients undergoing imaging studies. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Evaluation of atypical laboratory findings — As noted above, typical laboratory findings of COVID-19 are monitored for their prognostic value. (See 'Routine testing (all patients)' above.)Laboratory findings that are atypical for COVID-19, such as severe thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count <50,000/microL), a prolonged aPTT out of proportion to the PT, or a markedly reduced fibrinogen, should be evaluated as done for individuals without COVID-19, as discussed in separate topic reviews:●Thrombocytopenia – (See ""Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia"".)●Abnormal coagulation tests – (See ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Evaluation of abnormal results'.)Evaluation of bleeding — The evaluation is discussed separately. (See ""Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"" and ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Patient on anticoagulant'.)Management of bleeding depends on the underlying cause. (See 'Treatment of bleeding' below.)MANAGEMENTOverview of management considerations — Management can be challenging. Hypercoagulability appears to adversely impact prognosis, but there are no high-quality studies to support interventions that go beyond standard indications, and antithrombotic therapies carry risks of increased bleeding [30]. In the absence of high-quality data to guide management, institutions may vary in how aggressively they approach prevention and treatment of thromboembolic complications. Enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged to help determine the best approach [31]. Regardless of clinical trial enrollment, adherence to institutional protocols and input from individuals with expertise in hemostasis and thrombosis is advised to balance the risks of thrombosis and bleeding and guide decisions about antithrombotic therapy; bleeding caused by administration of excessive antithrombotic therapy may require prothrombotic treatments that further increase thrombotic risk.Acknowledging the lack of evidence, we agree with interim guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) [27,32]. Our approach is summarized in the table (table 1) and discussed in the following sections.Management of coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Additional measures' and ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Inpatient VTE prophylaxis●Indications – Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is appropriate in all hospitalized medical, surgical, and obstetric patients with COVID-19 (algorithm 1), unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, active bleeding or serious bleeding in the prior 24 to 48 hours) or to the use of heparin (eg, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT], in which case an alternative agent such as fondaparinux may be used).•ICU – All patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) require thromboprophylaxis. As discussed below, some would empirically use intermediate-dose or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in severely ill individuals in the absence of documented VTE. (See 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below.)•Medical (non-ICU) – All hospitalized medical patients should be treated with prophylactic-dose low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (or unfractionated heparin if LMW heparin is unavailable) for thromboprophylaxis. •Surgical – Perioperative VTE prophylaxis is especially important for patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized for a surgical procedure. Details of the timing and choice of agent are discussed separately. (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult orthopedic surgical patients"" and ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in adult nonorthopedic surgical patients"".)•Obstetric – We would also use VTE prophylaxis in obstetric patients with COVID-19 who are in the hospital prior to or following delivery. LMW heparin is appropriate if delivery is not expected within 24 hours and after delivery; unfractionated heparin is used if faster discontinuation is needed (eg, if delivery, neuraxial anesthesia, or an invasive procedure is anticipated within approximately 12 to 24 hours or at 36 to 37 weeks of gestation). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Medical and obstetric care of hospitalized patients' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)●Dosing – Dosing (subcutaneous) is generally as follows; however, many experts are recommending higher doses for critically ill individuals, especially those in the ICU (see 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below):•Enoxaparin – For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30 mL/min, 40 mg once daily; for CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min, 30 mg once daily.•Dalteparin – 5000 units once daily.•Nadroparin – For patients ≤70 kg, 3800 or 4000 anti-factor Xa units once daily; for patients >70 kg, 5700 units once daily. In some cases, doses up to 50 anti-factor Xa units/kg every 12 hours are used. •Tinzaparin – 4500 anti-factor Xa units once daily.For patients with CrCl <15 mL/min or renal replacement therapy, we use unfractionated heparin, which is much less dependent on elimination by the kidney. The tables have more information about adjustments for kidney impairment (table 2), obesity (table 3), and pregnancy (table 4).●Supporting evidence – LMW heparin is known to reduce the risk of VTE and may have antiinflammatory properties. In a retrospective series of 2773 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, in whom 786 (28 percent) received systemic anticoagulation, anticoagulation was associated with improved in-hospital survival in intubated patients (71 percent, versus 37 percent for those who were not anticoagulated) [33]. Intubated patients represented approximately 14 percent of the cohort; in the cohort as a whole, anticoagulation was not associated with better in-hospital survival (78 versus 77 percent). Bleeding events occurred in 3 percent of the anticoagulated patients and 2 percent of those who were not anticoagulated (not a statistically significant difference).In a retrospective study of 449 individuals with severe COVID-19, enoxaparin (40 to 60 mg once daily) appeared to be associated with improved survival when compared with no pharmacologic prophylaxis, especially in those with a high D-dimer [12]. •The survival difference was only seen in a subset of individuals with a high sepsis-induced coagulopathy score (28-day mortality, 40 percent with heparin versus 64 percent without) or a high D-dimer, not in the cohort as a whole. •The magnitude of benefit was greater in those with higher D-dimer values. The reduced mortality became statistically significant at six times the upper limit of normal (33 versus 52 percent). One small series (16 patients) used higher prophylactic doses of nadroparin along with clopidogrel and did not report any VTE events; the small size of the study and lack of a control group limits interpretation [4]. As discussed above, a high percentage (25 to 43 percent) of individuals with COVID-19 in the ICU had VTE despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, prompting many experts to suggest higher doses. (See 'VTE' above and 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation' below.)One study monitored antithrombin (AT) levels and provided AT concentrate for those with decreased levels [4]. However, we generally would not measure AT levels or consider AT concentrate unless an individual was known to have inherited AT deficiency or exhibited heparin resistance in association with a very low AT level. (See ""Antithrombin deficiency"", section on 'Heparin resistance'.)Indications for full-dose anticoagulation — Therapeutic-dose (full-dose) anticoagulation (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours) is appropriate in the following settings, unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, active bleeding or serious bleeding in the prior 24 to 48 hours) or to the use of heparin (eg, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT], in which case an alternative agent such as fondaparinux may be used) (algorithm 1):Documented or presumed VTE — Therapeutic-dose (full-dose) anticoagulation is appropriate for documented venous thromboembolism (VTE), similar to individuals without COVID-19. (See 'Diagnosis of DVT or PE' above.)Full-dose anticoagulation is also reasonable in some cases of suspected VTE in which standard confirmatory testing is not available or feasible, including the following: ●In patients for whom computed tomography with pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is not feasible, the following may be sufficient to initiate treatment:•Confirmation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using bilateral compression ultrasonography of the legs.•Transthoracic echocardiography or point-of-care ultrasound that demonstrates clot in transit in the main pulmonary artery.●In patients for whom no confirmatory testing is possible, it may be reasonable to treat empirically with full-dose anticoagulation based on one or more of the following:•Sudden deterioration in respiratory status in an intubated patient consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE), especially when chest radiography and/or inflammatory markers are stable or improving and the change cannot be attributed to a cardiac cause. •Otherwise unexplained respiratory failure (eg, not due to fluid overload or acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), especially if the fibrinogen and/or D-dimer is very high. •Physical findings consistent with thrombosis (superficial thrombophlebitis or retiform purpura not explained by other conditions).For patients with acute VTE who are discharged from the hospital, extended thromboprophylaxis may be reasonable. (See 'Patients discharged from the hospital' below.) Clotting of intravascular access devices — Full-dose anticoagulation is appropriate for individuals with recurrent clotting of intravascular access devices (arterial lines, central venous catheters) despite prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation.Full-dose anticoagulation is also appropriate in those with clotting in extracorporeal circuits (continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). Details are discussed separately. (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients — The question of treatment-dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis has also been raised in critically ill individuals and those in the ICU who have not had confirmed or suspected acute VTE but are at high risk, as described above. (See 'VTE' above.)Many centers are recommending intermediate-dose or even therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation in these individuals (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Venous thromboembolism prevention'). There are no data comparing different levels of anticoagulation in these patients (prophylactic, intermediate, or therapeutic dosing), and clinical trials are in progress. Enrollment in such a trial is encouraged. As stated by the American Society of Hematology (ASH), empiric full-dose anticoagulation for individuals who do not have VTE remains controversial, since data demonstrating improved outcomes are lacking, and some of the risk factors for VTE are also risk factors for increased risk of bleeding [29]. Thus, if VTE is suspected, confirmatory testing should be obtained or other indications for full-dose anticoagulation should be sought if possible, especially in individuals who are not in the ICU. This testing and other findings that support therapeutic-dose anticoagulation are discussed above. (See 'Diagnosis of DVT or PE' above.)Indications for tPA — Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is appropriate for usual indications, unless there is a contraindication:●Limb-threatening DVT – (See ""Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy in deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity: Patient selection and administration"".)●Massive PE – (See ""Approach to thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) therapy in acute pulmonary embolism: Patient selection and administration"".)●Acute stroke – (See ""Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke"".)  ●Acute myocardial infarction – (See ""Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: The use of fibrinolytic therapy"".) Consultation with the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) or stroke team in decision-making is advised if possible. In contrast, we are not using tPA in individuals with nonspecific findings such as hypoxia or laboratory evidence of hypercoagulability. A case series described administration of tPA to three individuals with ARDS associated with COVID-19 who did not have access to or were not eligible for other interventions such as ECMO [34]. One individual had transient improvement in laboratory parameters but ultimately died. The other two had improvement in laboratory parameters; clinical outcomes were not described.Outpatient thromboprophylaxisPatients discharged from the hospital — Individuals with documented VTE require a minimum of three months of anticoagulation, as discussed separately. (See ""Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"", section on 'Duration of therapy' and ""Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults"".)Some individuals who have not had a VTE may also warrant extended thromboprophylaxis following discharge from the hospital:●We would be most likely to use post-discharge prophylactic anticoagulation in individuals with other risk factors for VTE such as immobilization, recent surgery, or trauma. ●We would use other criteria similar to those used in the APEX and MARINER trials, including immobility and older age. Most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 would meet these criteria. ●However, bleeding risk also needs to be incorporated into decision-making. ●Options for post-discharge prophylaxis include those used in clinical trials, such as rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 31 to 39 days [35]. This subject is discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults"", section on 'Duration of prophylaxis'.) Patients not admitted to the hospital — Outpatient thromboprophylaxis may also be appropriate for selected individuals with COVID-19 who are not admitted to the hospital, especially those with other thrombotic risk factors such as prior VTE or recent surgery, trauma, or immobilization, noting that this practice is based on clinical judgment. There are no trials that address thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19.If thromboprophylaxis is used in an outpatient, we would use a regimen such as rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 31 to 39 days [35]. Treatment of bleeding — Bleeding does not appear to be a major manifestation of COVID-19. However, patients may have bleeding for other reasons, including trauma and/or treatment with anticoagulation. (See 'Bleeding' above.)The approach to bleeding is similar to individuals without COVID-19 and may involve anticoagulant reversal and/or discontinuation, transfusions for thrombocytopenia or hypofibrinogenemia, or specific therapies such as factor replacement.●Anticoagulant-associated bleeding – (See ""Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR"" and ""Management of bleeding in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants"" and ""Reversal of anticoagulation in intracranial hemorrhage"".)●Trauma coagulopathy – (See ""Acute coagulopathy associated with trauma"".)●An underlying bleeding disorder such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), hemophilia, or von Willebrand disease (VWD) – (See ""Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Initial treatment and prognosis"" and ""Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B"" and ""von Willebrand disease (VWD): Treatment of major bleeding and major surgery"".)Antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, epsilon aminocaproic acid) are generally not used in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), due to the concern that they may tip the balance towards thrombosis. Thus, they should be avoided in patients in whom the COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state is the predominant finding. (See 'Distinction from DIC' above and ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Prevention/treatment of bleeding'.)Fibrinogen is often increased in COVID-19, and supplementation with fibrinogen is not required unless there is bleeding that is attributable to hypofibrinogenemia or dysfibrinogenemia (fibrinogen activity level <150 to 200 mg/dL). (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above and ""Disorders of fibrinogen"", section on 'Treatment/prevention of bleeding'.)Investigational therapies — A number of therapies for COVID-19 are under investigation, some of which may impact thrombotic risk. However, effects of these treatments on hemostasis in this patient population have not been well studied. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Participation in clinical trials is encouraged in order to improve understanding of the most effective and safest means of preventing and treating thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Investigational therapies may be appropriate in life-threatening situations or as part of a clinical trial, and markedly increased D-dimer may be used as one criterion for identifying individuals with a worse prognosis. Close monitoring for clinical signs of thrombosis or bleeding is advised in all individuals with COVID-19, with input from an individual with expertise in hemostasis and thrombosis in those with severe or unusual presentations.SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"") ●Society guidelines for patients (see ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a hypercoagulable state associated with acute inflammatory changes and laboratory findings that are distinct from acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), save for those with very severe disease. Fibrinogen and D-dimer are increased, with typically only modest prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and mild thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia. The presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LA) is common in individuals with a prolonged aPTT. The pathogenesis of these abnormalities is incompletely understood, and there may be many contributing factors related to the acute inflammatory response to the disease. (See 'Pathogenesis' above.)●The risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is markedly increased, especially in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), with case series reporting prevalences of 25 to 43 percent in ICU patients, often despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. The risk for other thrombotic events (stroke, microvascular thrombosis) is less clear. (See 'Clinical features' above.)●All patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 should have a baseline complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer. Repeat testing is done according to the patient's clinical status. Outpatients do not require coagulation testing. The main purpose of this testing is to obtain prognostic information that may be used to inform level of care. (See 'Routine testing (all patients)' above.)●Imaging studies are appropriate for suspected VTE if feasible. If standard diagnostic studies are not feasible, other options for determining the need for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation are available, as discussed above. Laboratory abnormalities that are not typical of COVID-19 should be further evaluated, as described above. (See 'Role of additional testing' above.)●Management is challenging due to the acuity of the illness and a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding efficacy and safety of different approaches to prevent or treat thromboembolic complications of the disease. Our general approach, which is summarized in the table (table 1) and depicted in the algorithm (algorithm 1), includes:•All inpatients should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin is preferred, but unfractionated heparin can be used if LMW heparin is unavailable or if kidney function is severely impaired. Some institutional protocols include more aggressive anticoagulation with intermediate-dose or even therapeutic-dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis. (See 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' above and 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' above.)•Therapeutic-dose (full-dose) anticoagulation is appropriate to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), unless contraindicated. (See 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation' above.)•Bleeding is unusual but can occur. If it occurs, treatment is similar to non-COVID-19 patients and may include transfusions, anticoagulant reversal or discontinuation, or specific products for underlying bleeding disorders. (See 'Treatment of bleeding' above.)•Participation in clinical trials is encouraged in order to improve understanding of the most effective and safest means of preventing and treating thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Disease-specific therapies under investigation may impact thrombotic risk, but the effects of these treatments on hemostasis in this patient population have not been well documented.

In pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia, these early data show approximately the same rate of intensive care unit admissions as their nonpregnant counterparts. However, a few maternal deaths have been reported in the medical literature. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Maternal course'.)Does COVID-19 increase the risk for pregnancy complications?Yes, infected women, especially those who develop pneumonia, appear to have an increased frequency of preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of gestation) and cesarean delivery, which is likely related to severe maternal illness. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Pregnancy complications'.)Does SARS-CoV-2 cross the placenta?There is no definite evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crosses the placenta and infects the fetus; however, a few cases of placental tissue or membranes positive for SARS-CoV-2 and a few cases of possible in utero infection have been reported. The neonatal cases may have been false-positive test results or due to acquisition of infection soon after birth. Reports of COVID-19 infection in the neonate have generally described mild disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Vertical transmission'.)How can prenatal care be modified to decrease risk of contracting COVID-19?The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine support modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits to limit person-to-person contact and thus help prevent spread of COVID-19. Modifications should be tailored for low- versus high-risk pregnancies (eg, multiple gestation, hypertension, diabetes) and may include telehealth, reducing the number of in-person visits, timing of visits, grouping tests (eg, aneuploidy, diabetes, infection screening) to minimize maternal contact with others, restricting visitors during visits and tests, timing of indicated obstetric ultrasound examinations, and timing and frequency of use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Routine prenatal care in uninfected women'.)Should low-dose aspirin be avoided in pregnant women with COVID-19?Concern about possible negative effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for whom low-dose aspirin is indicated (eg, prevention of preeclampsia), ACOG suggests an individualized approach to continuation versus discontinuation. For example, continuing preeclampsia prophylaxis is likely not worthwhile in severely or critically ill patients or near term. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications'.)Should antenatal glucocorticoids be avoided in pregnant women with COVID-19?For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because they have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. However, the CDC have not addressed use of antenatal glucocorticoids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from preterm birth.Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. However, for pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation and at risk of preterm birth within seven days, the benefits to the neonate are less clear, and ACOG has advised not administering a course of betamethasone to such patients. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications'.)LABOR AND DELIVERYIs maternal COVID-19 an indication for cesarean delivery?No, COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery. Even if vertical transmission is confirmed as additional data are reported, this would not be an indication for cesarean delivery since it would increase maternal risk and would be unlikely to improve newborn outcome. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Route of delivery'.)Should planned induction of labor or cesarean delivery of asymptomatic women be postponed during the pandemic?No, in asymptomatic women, inductions of labor and cesarean deliveries with appropriate medical indications should not be postponed or rescheduled. This includes 39-week inductions or cesarean deliveries after patient counseling. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Timing delivery in infected women'.)How should labor pain be managed in women with COVID-19?A neuraxial anesthetic is generally preferred to other options for management of labor pain because it provides good analgesia and thus reduces cardiopulmonary stress from pain and anxiety. In addition, it is available in case an emergency cesarean is required, thus obviating the need for general anesthesia. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) suggests considering suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 because of insufficient data about cleaning, filtering, and potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems. They also urge consideration of limiting use of intravenous patient controlled analgesia because of the risk of respiratory depression. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Analgesia and anesthesia'.)Can an asymptomatic partner/support person attend labor and delivery?Practices vary by institution. At a minimum, the support person should be screened in accordance with hospital policies, and those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. Most facilities recognize that a support person is important to many laboring women and permit one support person who must remain with the laboring woman (may not leave her room and then return). Additional support persons can be a part of the patient's labor and delivery via video. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Infection control precautions'.)POSTPARTUMHow should the baby be evaluated?If the mother has known COVID-19, the infant is a COVID-19 suspect and should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Infant evaluation'.)Should the mother with COVID-19 be separated from her baby?The CDC advise health care facilities to determine whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the mother's clinical condition. Separation is unnecessary if the infant's SARS-CoV-2 testing result is positive. If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, measures to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission should be utilized (eg, physical barriers, mother-baby ≥6 feet separation, maternal use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, use of a healthy adult for infant care). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Mother-baby contact'.)How long should mother-baby precautions at home continue after recent infection?After discharge from the birth facility, a mother with symptomatic COVID-19 infection should maintain a distance of at least six feet from the newborn and use a face mask and hand hygiene for newborn care until (1) at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications plus improvement in respiratory symptoms [cough, shortness of breath]) and (2) at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. For mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have never been symptomatic, transmission precautions can be discontinued when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test. Test-based strategies for discontinuation of precautions are also available. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'After hospital discharge'.)Can breast milk transmit SARS-CoV-2?It is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk because very few breast milk samples have been tested. One report of testing found no virus in the breast milk of six patients and another found virus in one of the three samples of breast milk tested. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)What precautions should mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 take when breastfeeding?Droplet transmission from an infected mother to her baby could occur through close contact during breastfeeding. To minimize direct contact, ideally, the infant should be fed expressed breastmilk by a healthy caregiver following hygiene precautions until the mother has recovered or proven uninfected. In such cases, the mother should use strict handwashing before pumping and wear a face mask during pumping. If this approach is not possible, mothers should take precautions to prevent transmission to the infant during breastfeeding (including hand and breast hygiene and use of a face mask). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)Can postpartum women with COVID-19 take NSAIDs for postpartum analgesia?Concern about possible negative effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs when clinically indicated. Given the uncertainty, we suggest using acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used.

With droplet transmission, virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes. Infection can also occur if a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) and do not linger in the air. In one report, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols under experimental conditions for at least three hours; however, whether this is clinically meaningful is uncertain.While SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in non-respiratory specimens (eg, stool, blood), neither fecal-oral nor bloodborne transmission appear to be significant sources of infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described in animals, but there is no evidence to suggest that animals are a major source of transmission. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)What is the incubation period for COVID-19?The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Incubation period'.)CLINICAL PRESENTATIONWhat are the clinical presentation and natural history of COVID-19?The spectrum of illness associated with COVID-19 is wide, ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening respiratory failure. When symptoms are present, they typically arise approximately four to five days after exposure. Symptoms are mild in approximately 80 percent of cases and often include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Smell and taste disorders have also been reported in patients with COVID-19; whether these symptoms are distinguishing features is unknown. Gastrointestinal symptoms are not frequently reported but may be the presenting feature in some patients. Headache, rhinorrhea, and sore throat are less common. Dyspnea affects approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients, typically arising five to eight days after symptom onset. Progression from dyspnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be rapid; thus, the onset of dyspnea is generally an indication for hospital evaluation and management.Pneumonia is the most common manifestation of severe disease. ARDS develops in a sizable minority of symptomatic patients and can be associated with a cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fever, progressive hypoxia and/or hypotension, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. ARDS is the leading cause of death, followed by sepsis, cardiac complications, and secondary infections. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to be between two and three percent. While severe and fatal illness can occur in anyone, the risk rises dramatically with age and the presence of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and cancer. For those who recover, illness is often prolonged, lasting approximately two weeks in those with mild disease and three to six weeks in those with severe disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Is there a way to distinguish COVID-19 clinically from other respiratory illnesses, particularly influenza?No, the clinical features of COVID-19 overlap substantially with influenza and other respiratory viral illnesses. There is no way to distinguish among them without testing. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)What factors are associated with severe COVID-19?Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but it predominantly occurs in adults with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities. Comorbidities associated with severe illness and mortality include:●Cardiovascular disease●Diabetes mellitus●Hypertension●Chronic lung disease●Cancer●Chronic kidney disease●Obesity (body mass index ≥30)Immunosuppression is also presumed to be a risk factor for severe illness and mortality, but this has not yet been definitively demonstrated in studies. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)What are the major thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19?COVID-19 is a hypercoagulable state associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), often pulmonary embolism (PE). The risk is highest in individuals in the intensive care unit (ICU), often despite prophylactic anticoagulation. The rate of arterial events is unclear, and the rate of VTE is lower in hospitalized medical patients. Bleeding is not common but has been seen, especially in the setting of trauma and/or anticoagulation. Thrombotic complications are treated with therapeutic dose anticoagulation. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'VTE'.)What are the major coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19?A number of laboratory abnormalities have been reported, including high fibrinogen and D-dimer and mild prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Abnormal coagulation studies are mainly used to monitor clinical status and to help determine level of care. Very high D-dimer is associated with a high mortality rate. Atypical findings (eg, severe thrombocytopenia) should be further evaluated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Coagulation abnormalities'.)EVALUATIONWhen should patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 be advised to stay at home? Go to the hospital?Home management is appropriate for most patients with mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea), provided they can be adequately isolated, monitored, and supported in the outpatient setting. However, there should be a low threshold to clinically evaluate patients who have any risk factor for more severe illness, even if they have only mild symptoms. Patients being managed at home should be educated about the potential for worsening disease and advised to closely monitor for symptoms of more serious disease, including dyspnea or persistent chest pain. The development of these symptoms should prompt clinical evaluation and possible hospitalization. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted'.)What are the different types of tests for COVID-19?There are two major types of tests for COVID-19: ●Nucleic acid amplifications tests (NAATs; eg, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) – RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 is the primary test used to diagnose active COVID-19. The test is typically performed on nasopharyngeal swabs, but can also be performed on other respiratory tract specimens (eg, oropharyngeal swabs, lower respiratory tract samples). There are several different RT-PCR assays available, and the sensitivity and specificity of each assay differ. ●Serology – Serologic tests measure antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are primarily used to identify patients who have had COVID-19 in the past. While some serologic assays can help identify patients with acute infection, they are not as reliable as RT-PCR and not recommended for this purpose. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)How accurate is RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2? Should two tests be performed or one?Tests for COVID-19 are new, and determining their accuracy is challenging. A positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, false-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been well documented. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, we suggest repeating the test. For hospitalized patients with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement, the repeat test can be performed on expectorated sputum or a tracheal aspirate, if available. In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing and concern for false-negative results, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk (residence in or travel to an area with widespread community transmission or known contact). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)HOME CAREWhat advice should be given to patients with known or presumed COVID-19 managed at home?For most patients with COVID-19 who are managed at home, we advise the following: ●Supportive care with antipyretics/analgesics (eg, acetaminophen) and hydration ●Close contact with their health care provider ●Monitoring for clinical worsening, particularly the development of dyspnea, which should prompt clinical evaluation and possible hospitalization●Separation from other household members, including pets (eg, staying in a separate room when possible and wearing a mask when in the same room)●Frequent hand washing for all family members●Frequent disinfection of commonly touched surfaces(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Management and counseling for all outpatients'.)How long should patients cared for at home stay isolated?The optimal duration of home isolation is uncertain. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued recommendations on discontinuation of home isolation, which include both test-based and non-test-based strategies. The choice of strategy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, since each strategy has potential limitations. When a test-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue home isolation when there is:●Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications AND●Improvement in respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) AND●Negative results of a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) When a symptom-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue home isolation when the following criteria are met:●At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared AND●At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery of symptoms (defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms [eg, cough, shortness of breath])In some cases, patients may have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, but they did not have any symptoms when they were tested. In such patients, home isolation may be discontinued using a test-based strategy or a time-based strategy (when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 test) as long as there was no evidence of subsequent illness. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)MEDICATIONSWhat are the treatment options for patients with COVID-19? Do any have proven efficacy?All agents being used for the treatment of COVID-19 are investigational. Use of these agents is generally limited to hospitalized patients who have or are at risk for severe disease. When possible, treatment should be given as part of a clinical trial. Agents that appear more promising are listed here:●Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue. Emerging data suggest there is clinical benefit to its use, and we recommend remdesivir for hospitalized patients with severe disease. Although not widely available, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized emergency use, and several centers in the United States and elsewhere are performing randomized trials to further evaluate its efficacy. ●Convalescent plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 contains antibodies that could potentially hasten recovery in patients with active COVID-19. In the United States, the FDA is accepting emergency investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19.●Interleukin (IL)-6 pathway inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, are being evaluated for patients with severe disease and/or features consistent with cytokine release syndrome. Evidence of efficacy is anecdotal.●Hydroxychloroquine is an older, oral agent that has direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. We suggest not using hydroxychloroquine outside of a clinical trial because of the lack of clear benefit for its use and its potential toxicities.Other investigational agents include favipiravir, interferon beta, lopinavir-ritonavir, and combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin. Because all treatment options are investigational, monitoring for adverse effects is an important part of care. Registries of clinical trials can be found on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Should I use acetaminophen or NSAIDs when providing supportive care?Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been theorized to cause harm in patients with COVID-19, but there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk. Given the uncertainty, we use acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent for most patients rather than NSAIDs. If NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose. We do not routinely discontinue NSAIDs in patients using them for the management of chronic illnesses. The FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) do not recommend that NSAIDs be avoided when clinically indicated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Should glucocorticoids be used for treatment of COVID-19?No, we agree with recommendations by the WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that systemic glucocorticoids not be used in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications (eg, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)Do ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the likelihood of severe COVID-19?Patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents. The membrane-bound ACE2 functions as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and because ACE inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2, there is speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for severe disease. However, there is no evidence to support an association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with more severe disease, and it is also possible that these drugs may attenuate the severity of disease. In addition, stopping these agents in some patients can exacerbate comorbid cardiovascular or kidney disease and increase mortality. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'ACE inhibitors/ARBs' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)When should anticoagulation be used, and how much?All inpatients with COVID-19 (intensive care unit [ICU], medical, surgical, and obstetric) should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated (algorithm 1). Prophylactic dose low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is preferred, but prophylactic dose unfractionated heparin can be used if LMW heparin is unavailable or if kidney function is severely impaired. Some institutional protocols include more aggressive anticoagulation with intermediate dose or even therapeutic dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis, especially in the ICU, and some continue anticoagulation in selected patients following discharge. Data are lacking on the efficacy and safety of these approaches, and enrollment in a clinical trial is encouraged. Full (therapeutic)-dose anticoagulation is used for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Management'.)PREVENTION AND INFECTION CONTROLHave any medications been shown to prevent COVID-19?No agent is known to be effective for preventing COVID-19. While hydroxychloroquine is being studied as a prophylactic agent, its safety and efficacy have not been proven. We suggest that neither this medication nor any other be used for prophylaxis outside of clinical trials. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)What PPE is recommended for health care workers taking care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?Any personnel entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE): gown, gloves, eye protection (eyeglasses alone are insufficient), and a respirator (eg, an N95 respirator). If the supply of respirators is limited, facemasks are an acceptable alternative, except during aerosol-generating procedures (eg, tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, bronchoscopy, noninvasive ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Health care workers should be aware of the appropriate sequence of putting on (figure 1) and taking off (figure 2) PPE to avoid contamination.In addition, patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures should be placed in negative-pressure rooms. Most other patients can be placed in a single-occupancy, neutral-pressure room with the door closed. Patients with suspected or known COVID-19 should not be placed in positive-pressure rooms. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)IMMUNITYDoes protective immunity develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection? Can reinfection occur?Antibodies to the virus are induced in those who have become infected. Preliminary evidence suggests that some of these antibodies are protective, but this remains to be definitively established. Moreover, it is unknown whether all infected patients mount a protective immune response and how long any protective effect will last. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Immunity and risk of reinfection'.)SPECIAL POPULATIONSAsthma/COPDShould patients using inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma or COPD be advised to stop these medications to prevent COVID-19?No, patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who need inhaled glucocorticoids to maintain control of their asthma or COPD should continue them at their usual dose. When indicated, inhaled steroids help to minimize risk of an asthma or COPD exacerbation and the associated need for interaction with the health care system. There is no good evidence that inhaled glucocorticoids increase susceptibility to COVID-19 or have an adverse effect on the course of infection. Stopping them may worsen asthma or COPD control and thereby increase the risk for complications of COVID-19, if acquired. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Should patients with COVID-19 and an acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD be treated with systemic glucocorticoids?Yes, patients with COVID-19 infection and a concomitant acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD should receive prompt treatment with systemic glucocorticoids as indicated by usual guidelines. Delaying therapy can increase the risk of a life-threatening exacerbation. While the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend glucocorticoids not be routinely used in the treatment of COVID-19 infection, exacerbations of asthma and COPD are considered appropriate indications for use. Overall, the known benefits of systemic glucocorticoids for exacerbations of asthma and COPD outweigh the potential harm in COVID-19 infection. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeedingWhat special considerations are there for pregnant and breastfeeding women?Issues related to COVID-19 during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: Questions and answers"".)PediatricsWhat is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children?Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that has been reported in children from Europe, the United States, and Canada in association with current or recent COVID-19 infection or exposure. It shares clinical features with Kawasaki disease (KD), KD shock, and toxic shock syndrome. Clinical features include persistent fever, severe illness with involvement of multiple organ systems, and elevated inflammatory markers (table 1). Most children with MIS-C have survived, although many have required intensive care. Pending additional information, children with clinical features of MIS-C should be promptly referred to a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases, rheumatology, cardiology, and/or critical care, as necessary. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)BLOOD DONATIONWhat should I tell patients about donating blood or plasma during the pandemic?Blood donation is particularly important during the pandemic due to concerns that the supply could become critically low. Having a history of COVID-19 is not an exclusion to donation as long as the illness resolved at least 14 days prior to donation. Persons who have recovered from COVID-19 are encouraged to donate plasma, because convalescent plasma is an investigational treatment for COVID-19. Information on where to donate blood or plasma can be found at the American Red Cross and the AABB websites or by contacting community blood centers. (See ""Blood donor screening: Medical history"", section on 'COVID-19 pandemic revised deferral criteria' and ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)REFERENCESSupporting references can be found in the linked UpToDate topics.","for COVID-19:  Nucleic acid amplifications tests (NAATs; eg, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) – RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 is the primary test used to diagnose active COVID-19.

ID:127429,medical,medical_review,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults,/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-management-in-hospitalized-adults?search=covid+19&source=search_result&selectedTitle=11%7E150&usage_type=default,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.This topic will discuss the management of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. Our approach to hospital management is based on limited data and evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management, which may differ from our approach. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and, in the United States, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3] and the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel [4]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)The management of patients with COVID-19 in the home and outpatient setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Issues related to COVID-19 in specific populations are discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EVALUATION — Our objective in the evaluation of hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 is to evaluate for features associated with severe illness (table 1) and identify organ dysfunction or other comorbidities that could complicate potential therapy. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Although we check several laboratory tests to evaluate patients with documented or suspected COVID-19, the prognostic value of many of them remains uncertain, and other institutions may not include all these tests. At least initially, we check the following laboratory studies daily:●Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, with a focus on the total lymphocyte count trend●Complete metabolic panel●Creatine kinase (CK)●C-reactive protein (CRP)●FerritinInitially, we check the following studies every other day (or daily if elevated or in the intensive care unit):●Prothrombin time (PT)/partial prothrombin time (PTT)/fibrinogen●D-dimerWe check the following studies at baseline and repeat them if abnormal or with clinical worsening:●Lactate dehydrogenase, repeated daily if elevated●Troponin, repeated every two to three days if elevated●Electrocardiogram (ECG), with at least one repeat test after starting any QTc-prolonging agent (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Monitoring for QT prolongation')We also check hepatitis B virus serologies, hepatitis C virus antibody, and HIV antigen/antibody testing if these have not been previously performed. Chronic viral hepatitis could affect interpretation of transaminase elevations and exacerbate hepatotoxicity of certain therapies; underlying HIV infection may change the assessment of the patient's risk for deterioration and would warrant initiation of antiretroviral therapy. We check a portable chest radiograph in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; for most patients, this is sufficient for initial evaluation of pulmonary complications and extent of lung involvement. Although chest computed tomography (CT) was frequently used in China for evaluation of patients with COVID-19, we reserve chest CT for circumstances that might change clinical management, in part to minimize infection control issues related to transport. This is consistent with recommendations from the American College of Radiology [5]. Although certain characteristic chest CT findings may be seen in COVID-19, they cannot reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other causes of viral pneumonia. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.)We do not routinely obtain echocardiograms on patients with COVID-19; developments that might warrant an echocardiogram include increasing troponin levels with hemodynamic compromise or other cardiovascular findings suggestive of cardiomyopathy. Acute myocardial injury has been a described complication of COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'When to suspect myocardial injury and key considerations'.) Secondary bacterial infection has not been a frequently reported feature of COVID-19; if this is suspected (eg, based on chest imaging or sudden deterioration), we check two sets of blood cultures and sputum Gram stain and culture. Procalcitonin can be checked to assess the risk of secondary bacterial infection; however, since elevated procalcitonin levels have been reported as COVID-19 progresses, they may be less specific for bacterial infection later in the disease course [6-9]. As above, the prognostic value of the results of some of the tests we use to evaluate patients with COVID-19 is uncertain, and the optimal use of these markers remains unknown. As an example, although some clinicians also note the potential utility of troponin levels to inform the risk of severe COVID-19 and provide a baseline for comparison in patients who develop manifestations of myocardial injury [10], others reserve troponin level testing for patients who have specific clinical suspicion for acute coronary syndrome [11]. One concern is that the results could lead to unnecessary use of medical resources (eg, serial troponins, electrocardiograms and cardiology consults for elevated troponin). If troponin is checked in a patient with COVID-19, clinicians should be aware that an elevated level does not necessarily indicate acute coronary syndrome. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'Troponin'.) GENERAL MANAGEMENT ISSUESEmpiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia in select patients — For patients with documented COVID-19, we do not routinely administer empiric therapy for bacterial pneumonia. Data are limited, but bacterial superinfection does not appear to be a prominent feature of COVID-19. However, since the clinical features of COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from bacterial pneumonia, empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia is reasonable when the diagnosis is uncertain. Empiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia may also be reasonable in patients with documented COVID-19 if there is clinical suspicion for it (eg, new fever after defervescence with new consolidation on chest imaging). If empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated, we attempt to make a microbial diagnosis (eg, through sputum Gram stain and culture, urinary antigen testing) and reevaluate the need to continue antibiotic therapy daily. In such settings, a low procalcitonin may be helpful to suggest against a bacterial pneumonia; however, elevated procalcitonin has been described in COVID-19, particularly late in the course of illness, and does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection [6-9]. (See ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"", section on 'Guiding antibiotic therapy'.)The diagnosis of and empiric antibiotic regimens for community-acquired and health care-associated pneumonia are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Overview of community-acquired pneumonia in adults"" and ""Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"" and ""Treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"".)Prevention of and evaluation for venous thromboembolism — We favor pharmacologic prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19, consistent with recommendations from several expert societies [12-14]. Dosing and selection of pharmacologic agents to prevent venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere (algorithm 1). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis'.)Several studies suggest a high rate of thromboembolic complications among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly those who are critically ill. The thromboembolic risk with COVID-19 as well as the evaluation for and management of these complications are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'VTE' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation'.)Uncertainty about NSAID use — There are minimal data informing the risks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the setting of COVID-19. We use acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose; this is consistent with the general approach to fever reduction in adults (see ""Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults"", section on 'Treating fever'). We do not discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions, unless there are other reasons to stop them (eg, renal injury, gastrointestinal bleeding). Concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young patients who received NSAIDs early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [15,16]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO, and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel do not recommend NSAIDs be avoided when clinically indicated [4,17,18]. Avoiding nebulized medications — Inhaled medications should be administered by metered dose inhaler, whenever possible, rather than through a nebulizer, to avoid the risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 through nebulization. If a nebulizer must be used, appropriate infection control precautions should be taken. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)'.)Limited role of glucocorticoids — We agree with recommendations by the WHO and CDC that systemic glucocorticoids not be used in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications (eg, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) [19,20].For those without pre-existing pulmonary disease, we also avoid inhaled glucocorticoids. The use of inhaled glucocorticoids in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the setting of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Acute exacerbations of asthma in adults: Emergency department and inpatient management"", section on 'Advice related to covid-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in management of SARS, there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm [21]. (See ""Treatment of seasonal influenza in adults"", section on 'Adjunctive therapies' and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Treatment and prevention"", section on 'Treatment'.)The approach to glucocorticoids among critically ill patients with COVID-19 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'.)Managing chronic medicationsACE inhibitors/ARBs — Patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents if there is no other reason for discontinuation (eg, hypotension, acute kidney injury). This approach is supported by multiple guidelines panels [22-26]. There has been speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes, but this has not been supported by findings from observational studies. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)Conversely, ARBs have also been proposed to have potential protective effects based on their mechanism of action [27], but there is no trial evidence to support this hypothesis. We do not use ACE inhibitors or ARBs as potential COVID-19 treatment.Statins — We make a point of continuing statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are already taking them. A high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 have underlying cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and other indications for use of statins. Moreover, acute cardiac injury is a reported complication of COVID-19. Although clinicians may be concerned about hepatotoxicity from statins, particularly since transaminase elevations are common in COVID-19, most evidence indicates that liver injury from statins is uncommon. (See ""Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration"", section on 'Hepatic dysfunction'.) Whether statins could impact the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clear. Statins are known inhibitors of the MYD88 pathway, which results in marked inflammation, and have been reported to stabilize MYD88 levels in the setting of external stress in vitro and in animal studies [28]. Dysregulation of MYD88 has been noted and associated with poor outcomes in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, but this has not been described with SARS-CoV-2. Although statins might be of benefit in patients with COVID-19, more data are needed.Immunomodulatory agents — Use of immunosuppressing agents has been associated with increased risk for severe disease with other respiratory viruses, and the decision to discontinue prednisone, biologics, or other immunosuppressive drugs in the setting of COVID-19 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"", section on 'Patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Adjusting immunosuppression'.) For individuals with underlying conditions who require treatment with these agents and do not have suspected or documented COVID-19, there is no evidence that routinely discontinuing treatment is of any benefit. In addition, discontinuing these medications may result in loss of response when the agent is reintroduced. The approach of continuing immunomodulatory therapy in patients without infection is supported by statements from dermatology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology societies [29-32].Infection control — Infection control is an essential component of management of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.) COVID-19-SPECIFIC THERAPYSpecific treatments — Several treatments are being evaluated for COVID-19. Although some of these treatments are clinically available for other indications, their use for COVID-19 remains investigational.Remdesivir — Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro [33]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for hospitalized children and adults with severe COVID-19 (SpO2 ≤94 percent on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) [34]. The suggested adult dose is 200 mg intravenously on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for 10 days total in patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO and 5 days total in other patients (with extension to 10 days if there is no clinical improvement). Remdesivir is not recommended in patients with an alanine aminotransferase ≥5 times the upper limit of normal (and should be discontinued if it rises above this level during treatment or if there are other signs of liver injury). The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in the setting of renal impairment are uncertain, and it is prepared in a cyclodextrin vehicle that accumulates in renal impairment and may be toxic; thus, remdesivir is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Data from comparative, randomized trials are needed to define the effect of remdesivir in COVID-19; these data are emerging but remain limited and mixed. Overall, if preliminary results are confirmed, there is likely some clinical benefit to remdesivir, although the patient population most likely to benefit remains uncertain.The United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced preliminary results of a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir among 1063 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and evidence of lung involvement [35]. On interim analysis, remdesivir resulted in a faster time to recovery, defined as being discharged from the hospital or no longer requiring supplemental oxygen (median 11 versus 15 days with placebo, p<0.001). There was also a trend towards lower mortality that was not statistically significant (8 versus 11.6 percent with placebo, p = 0.059). Final analysis and peer review of these data are pending. In contrast, in a double-blind randomized trial in China of 237 patients with severe COVID-19 (hypoxia and radiographically confirmed pneumonia), time to clinical improvement was not statistically different with remdesivir compared with placebo for 10 days (median 21 versus 23 days; hazard ratio for improvement 1.23 [95% CI 0.87-1.75]) [36]. Clinical improvement was defined as discharge from the hospital or a two-point improvement on a six-point clinical score that ranges from death to mechanical ventilation to lower levels of oxygen support to discharge. This study only included one patient who was on mechanical ventilation at baseline. Mortality at 28 days was also similar with remdesivir or placebo (14 versus 13 percent); there was also no difference in time to viral clearance. Among patients who had received treatment within 10 days of symptom onset, there were trends towards lower mortality and more rapid clinical improvement with remdesivir, but these differences were not statistically significant. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events (including gastrointestinal symptoms, aminotransferase or bilirubin elevations, and worsened cardiopulmonary status) in 12 percent, compared with 5 percent in the placebo group. Several limitations reduce confidence in the finding of no effect; concomitant therapies (lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon alpha-2b, and/or corticosteroids) were used by most study participants, patients in the remdesivir group had a higher proportion of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease), and the study was stopped early for poor enrollment (the target enrollment pre-determined to demonstrate effect was 435 patients). Early data suggest that 5 days of remdesivir result in similar outcomes as 10. In a preliminary report from the manufacturer of a randomized, open-label trial among nearly 400 patients with severe COVID-19 who were not on mechanical ventilation, the rates of clinical recovery and discharge by day 14 were not statistically different when remdesivir was given for 5 days (65 and 60 percent, respectively) versus 10 days (54 and 52 percent, respectively) [37]. Mortality rates at day 14 were 8 and 11 percent with 5 and 10 days of treatment, respectively, and varied by geographic location.Use of remdesivir has also been described in several case series [38-40]. In one multicenter, multinational series, 53 patients with severe COVID-19 and hypoxia received compassionate-use remdesivir for up to 10 days and had a median of 18 days of follow-up; 68 percent had clinical improvement (decreased requirement for oxygen support or hospital discharge), and 13 percent died [40]. Of the 30 patients who were mechanically ventilated at baseline, 17 (57 percent) were extubated, and three of four patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were taken off it. Reported side effects include nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations. In a preliminary report from a trial of remdesivir among patients with severe COVID-19, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations occurred in 7 percent and led to drug discontinuation in 3 percent [37]. Other adverse events described in patients who received remdesivir include worsening kidney injury, multiple organ failure, and worsened cardiopulmonary status [36,40]. Convalescent plasma — In the United States, the FDA is accepting investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 [41]; pathways for use through these applications include clinical trials, expanded access programs, and emergency individual use. Use of convalescent plasma has been described in case series [42-44]. One case series described administration of plasma from donors who had completely recovered from COVID-19 to five patients with severe COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation and persistently high viral titers despite investigational antiviral treatment [42]. The patients had decreased nasopharyngeal viral load, decreased disease severity score, and improved oxygenation by 12 days after transfusion. However, these findings do not establish a causal effect, and the efficacy of convalescent plasma remains unknown. In another case series of six patients who received convalescent plasma late in the course of illness, five died despite SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance within three days of treatment [44]. Finding appropriate donors and establishing testing to confirm neutralizing activity of plasma may be logistical challenges. In the United States, the American Red Cross is helping to collect and distribute convalescent plasma throughout the country [45]. (See ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)The FDA is also facilitating the evaluation of hyperimmune globulin for patients with COVID-19 [45]. IL-6 pathway inhibitors — Markedly elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin) and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin [IL]-6) are associated with critical and fatal COVID-19, and blocking the inflammatory pathway has been hypothesized to prevent disease progression. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor inhibitor used for rheumatic diseases and cytokine release syndrome and is being evaluated in randomized trials for treatment of COVID-19. Case reports and observational studies have described use of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 [46-53]. As an example, in a study of 63 patients with severe COVID-19 who had laboratory results suggesting a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, no major adverse events were thought to be directly related to tocilizumab (given intravenously or subcutaneously), which was associated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin levels; overall, there was a 14-day mortality rate of 11 percent [51].Sarilumab and siltuximab are other agents that target the IL-6 pathway and are also being evaluated in clinical trials. Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine — There are insufficient data thus far to know whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has a role in treatment of COVID-19. For this reason, we strongly recommend that patients should be referred to a clinical trial whenever possible. In the United States, the FDA has issued an emergency use authorization to allow the use of these agents in adolescents or adults hospitalized for COVID-19 when participation in clinical trials is not feasible [54]. When a clinical trial is not available, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity. If drugs are used for COVID-19 outside a clinical trial, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) encourages creation of a registry, when possible, to systematically evaluate their safety and efficacy [55]. Additionally, if hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is used outside of a clinical trial, the potential for adverse effects should be carefully assessed. In particular, these agents can prolong the QT interval and should be avoided in patients with prolonged baseline QTc interval or on other agents that affect cardiac conduction, and otherwise should be used with close monitoring. The American College of Cardiology has suggested QTc monitoring parameters in this setting [56]. QTc monitoring in this setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Monitoring for QT prolongation'.)Other risks (eg, retinopathy or cardiomyopathy) are primarily with longer-term use and higher cumulative doses, but should be a consideration when deciding to use these agents. Catastrophic outcomes have been reported with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine overdose; no individual should use these medications without medical supervision [57,58]. (See ""Antimalarial drugs in the treatment of rheumatic disease"", section on 'Adverse effects'.)Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, although hydroxychloroquine appears to have more potent antiviral activity [59]. Randomized trials evaluating their clinical use are underway. However, published clinical data on either of these agents are limited, have methodologic problems, and do not suggest a clear benefit [60-65]. In an open-label randomized trial of 150 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (either no pneumonia or pneumonia without hypoxia), adding hydroxychloroquine to standard of care did not improve the rate of SARS-CoV-2 clearance (84 versus 81 percent with standard of care alone) or result in symptomatic improvement (60 versus 66 percent) by 28 days [64]. Methodologic concerns with this trial include concomitant co-therapies, baseline differences between the groups, and lack of blinding or placebo control. Available evidence does not suggest a benefit for patients with severe COVID-19, although data in this population are limited to observational studies. In an observational study of nearly 1400 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in New York, hydroxychloroquine use was reported in 811 patients and was associated with a higher risk of intubation or death (hazard ratio [HR] 2.37) [62]. Patients who received hydroxychloroquine were older, were more likely to have comorbidities, and had more severe illness than those who did not, which were likely confounding variables; in a multivariate analysis comparing those patients with a propensity score-matched subset of 274 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine, there was no association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (adjusted HR 1.04). In another observational study from France of 180 patients with severe COVID-19 who required oxygen supplementation but not critical care, the rates of transfer to the intensive care unit or death were similar among those who did and did not receive hydroxychloroquine [65].Studies have, however, highlighted the potential for toxicity of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. One trial comparing two doses of chloroquine for COVID-19 was stopped early because of a higher mortality rate in the high-dose group [66]. In an observational study in which 84 patients received hydroxychloroquine, 10 percent had electrocardiographic changes that prompted discontinuation [65]. QTc prolongation with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)'.)The evidence on the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Others' below.)Others — Many other agents with known or putative antiviral or immunomodulating effects have been proposed for use in patients with COVID-19 [67-71], and some are in preclinical or clinical evaluation. Use of these agents for COVID-19 should be limited to clinical trials; their efficacy has not been proven, and extensive off-label use may result in excess toxicity and critical shortages of drugs for proven indications. A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org, as well as on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. ●Favipiravir – Favipiravir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor that is available in some Asian countries for treatment of influenza, and it is being evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 in the United States. In a study of patients with non-severe disease (including oxygen saturation >93 percent), use of favipiravir was associated with faster rates of viral clearance (median time to clearance 4 versus 11 days) and more frequent radiographic improvement (in 91 versus 62 percent by day 14) compared with lopinavir-ritonavir [72]. However, other therapies were administered in this non-randomized, open-label study, so the results should be interpreted with caution given potential confounders.●Interferon beta – Interest in interferon beta for SARS-CoV-2 was spurred by evidence suggesting in vitro activity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and good outcomes in an animal model of MERS-CoV infection [73-75]. In one open-label randomized trial from Hong Kong, 127 adults hospitalized with primarily nonsevere COVID-19 were randomly assigned 2:1 to a combination intervention (interferon beta, ribavirin, plus lopinavir-ritonavir if symptom onset was within 7 days or ribavirin plus lopinavir-ritonavir if symptom onset was between 7 to 14 days) versus control (lopinavir-ritonavir alone) [76]. Patients in the intervention group had more rapid times to a negative SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal swab (median 7 versus 12 days), clinical improvement (median 4 versus 8 days), and hospital discharge (median 9 versus 15 days); in a subgroup analysis, the differences were only observed among patients with symptom onset within 7 days who thus received interferon beta as part of the intervention. Adverse effects were similar between the intervention and control groups. No hemolysis was detected with ribavirin (400 mg orally twice daily). Further study is needed to clarify the role of interferon beta in COVID-19 therapy.●Other immunomodulatory agents – Because of the observation that some patients have a clinical presentation that resembles cytokine release syndrome and the association between severe disease and a number of pro-inflammatory markers, interrupting the inflammatory cascade has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for severe COVID-19. In addition to IL-6 pathway inhibitors (see 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors' above), immunomodulatory agents from various classes, including IL-1 inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and complement inhibitors, are being evaluated. Their use has been described in case series and other observational studies [68,77-80]. As an example, in a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring non-invasive ventilation, and markedly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) or ferritin, receipt of high-dose anakinra in 29 patients (in addition to hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir) was associated with a lower 21-day mortality rate compared with a historical cohort of 16 patients who received only hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir (10 versus 44 percent); however, the historical group was older, and the likelihood of other, unmeasured confounders makes the findings difficult to interpret [77]. Results of randomized trials are necessary to determine the effect of these agents. ●Azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine – We do not use azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19. Use of the combination has been described in observational studies [60,63,81,82]. Although one study suggested the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine was associated with more rapid resolution of virus detection than hydroxychloroquine alone [60], this result should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size, substantial methodologic concerns [83], and unclear biologic plausibility. Another small observational study in patients with more severe illness did not suggest rapid viral RNA clearance with the combination [81]. Furthermore, both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine are associated with QTc prolongation, and combined use may potentiate this adverse effect. In a large observational study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, the adjusted mortality rate among those who received azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine was similar compared with those who received neither agent, but the rate of cardiac arrest was higher [63].●Lopinavir-ritonavir – This combined protease inhibitor, which has primarily been used for HIV infection, has in vitro activity against the SARS-CoV [84] and appears to have some activity against MERS-CoV in animal studies [73]. However, lopinavir-ritonavir appears to have minimal to no role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of a clinical trial. The WHO has launched a multinational trial to further evaluate remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir with and without interferon beta [85]. Results from a randomized trial do not demonstrate a clear benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir. In a randomized trial of 199 patients with severe COVID-19, the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir (400/100 mg) twice daily for 14 days to standard care did not decrease the time to clinical improvement compared with standard care alone [86]. There was a trend towards decreased mortality with lopinavir-ritonavir (19 versus 25 percent), and the numerical difference in mortality was greater among those who were randomized within 12 days of symptom onset, but neither difference was statistically significant. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 decline was similar in the group that received lopinavir-ritonavir and the group that did not. Lopinavir-ritonavir was stopped early in 14 percent because of adverse effects. If lopinavir-ritonavir is used, the patient's HIV status should be known. If the patient has HIV, lopinavir-ritonavir should be used as a standard combination antiretroviral regimen. Approach — The optimal approach to treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Although some trial data suggest a benefit with remdesivir, these data are very preliminary and have not been formally peer reviewed or reported, and there are otherwise no therapies that have clearly proven effective; for most potential therapies, evidence for their use comes primarily from observational case series and anecdotal use based on in vitro or extrapolated indirect evidence.Thus, when available, we strongly recommend enrollment into a well-controlled clinical trial. Our approach is consistent with recommendations from expert groups in the United States. The IDSA recommends that COVID-19-specific therapy be given in the context of a clinical trial and additionally recommends certain therapies (including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and tocilizumab) only be administered in the context of a clinical trial because of a greater level of uncertainty or potential for toxicity [55]. Similarly, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel notes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any antiviral or immune-based therapy and specifically recommends against using certain therapies (including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, interferons, and Janus kinase inhibitors) outside the context of a clinical trial [4].A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org, as well as on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. We use a risk-based approach to try to enroll those patients who may be most likely to benefit. The approach is dependent on local availability of clinical trials and may not be universally applicable. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management.Defining disease severity — Mild disease is characterized by fever, malaise, cough, upper respiratory symptoms, and/or less common features of COVID-19, in the absence of dyspnea. Most of these patients do not need hospitalization. If patients develop dyspnea, that raises concern that they have at least moderate severity disease, and these patients often warrant hospitalization. Patients can have infiltrates on chest imaging and still be considered to have moderate disease, but the presence of any of the following features indicates severe disease: ●Hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤93 percent on room air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg)●Tachypnea (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute) or respiratory distress●More than 50 percent involvement of the lung parenchyma on chest imagingThese features were used in China to characterize severe disease in a large cohort of patients [87] and are consistent with the United States NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel definition of severe infection [4]. We also treat patients who have certain laboratory abnormalities (table 1) similar to patients who have severe disease, because these abnormalities have been associated with disease progression in several studies.Nonsevere disease — For most patients with nonsevere disease, we suggest supportive care only, with close monitoring for clinical worsening. If they develop features of severe disease (eg, hypoxia, tachypnea, or respiratory distress (see 'Defining disease severity' above)), or if they have any laboratory features associated with disease progression (table 1), we treat them as described below. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' below.)Some clinical trials may be available for patients with nonsevere disease. If so, we prioritize patients who have epidemiologic risk factors associated with development of severe illness (table 2). We generally do not treat patients with nonsevere disease with experimental agents outside the context of a clinical trial.Severe (including critical) disease — We prioritize COVID-19-specific therapy for hospitalized patients who have severe disease or laboratory risk factors for disease progression (table 1). For hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, we recommend remdesivir, if available. In the United States, remdesivir can be obtained through the FDA's emergency use authorization, although availability is limited to hospitals designated for distribution by the federal government [88]. For pregnant individuals, remdesivir may also be obtained through a compassionate use program. (See 'Remdesivir' above.)For patients with severe disease or laboratory risk factors for disease progression (table 1) who cannot get remdesivir through these routes, we recommend referral to a clinical trial for treatment. We also refer patients who are able to get remdesivir through emergency use authorization to clinical trials for other agents, if they allow concurrent use of remdesivir. In addition to remdesivir, therapies being evaluated in trials include convalescent plasma and hydroxychloroquine. Patients who have features similar to cytokine release syndrome (eg, persistent fevers with elevated cytokine levels, ferritin, D-dimer, and/or other inflammatory markers) may also be eligible for clinical trials of IL-6 pathway inhibitors or other immunomodulators. A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org. Detailed discussion of these agents is found elsewhere. (See 'Specific treatments' above.) If neither a clinical trial nor emergency-use remdesivir is an option, clinicians may be able to obtain convalescent plasma for investigational treatment of COVID-19; in the United States, this may be accessed through the FDA's investigational new drug application or expanded access program [41]. (See 'Convalescent plasma' above.)Although treatment is hypothesized to have greater impact when given early in the course of disease, the optimal timing for implementation of any of these therapies remains unknown. Until more data are available, it is uncertain which patients would benefit the most and how to best allocate potentially limited clinical trial slots or emergency use agents.Several agents being investigated for treatment of COVID-19 are available for other medical indications, and repurposed use for COVID-19 has been described. There are insufficient data to know whether these agents have any role in treatment of COVID-19; thus, we strongly recommend that patients be referred to a clinical trial whenever possible.When a clinical trial is not an option and remdesivir or convalescent plasma cannot be obtained, we favor supportive care rather than off-label use of available agents with unknown efficacy for COVID-19. In particular, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine outside of a clinical trial; limited available data do not suggest a clear benefit and do suggest the potential for toxicity. However, we acknowledge that, in the absence of other options, some clinicians may choose to use certain agents (eg, hydroxychloroquine, or IL-6 pathway inhibitors in patients with evidence of a severe pro-inflammatory state) for severely ill patients. If drugs are used for COVID-19 outside a clinical trial, the IDSA encourages creation of a registry to systematically evaluate their safety and efficacy [55]. MANAGEMENT OF HYPOXIA, ARDS, AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS — Patients with severe disease often need oxygenation support. High-flow oxygen and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation have been used, but the safety of these measures is uncertain, and they should be considered aerosol-generating procedures that warrant specific isolation precautions. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Respiratory care of the nonintubated patient'.) Some patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and warrant intubation with mechanical ventilation. Management of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and other critical care issues are discussed in detail elsewhere (table 3). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".) In addition to ARDS, other complications of infection include arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, thromboembolic events, and shock. Management of these complications is discussed elsewhere. ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Acute kidney injury'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)DISCHARGE — The decision to discharge a patient with COVID-19 is generally the same as that for other conditions and depends on the need for hospital-level care and monitoring. Continued need for infection control precautions should not prevent discharge home if the patient can appropriately self-isolate there; long-term care facilities may have specific requirements prior to accepting patients with COVID-19. Criteria for discontinuing precautions and infection control issues in long-term care facilities are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Long-term care facilities'.)Patients with COVID-19 generally warrant outpatient follow-up through telehealth or an in-person visit following discharge from the hospital. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Outpatient management following inpatient or ED discharge'.)We encourage patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to consider donating convalescent plasma. Interested patients can be referred to their community blood center or, in the United States, to the American Red Cross to determine whether they meet eligibility criteria for donation. (See ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'COVID-19 pandemic'.) INSTITUTIONAL PROTOCOLS — Several academic medical institutions in the United States have developed COVID-19 management protocols that are publicly available. Given the paucity of high-quality clinical evidence on the management of COVID-19, the safety and efficacy of these strategies are uncertain: ●Brigham and Women's Hospital●Massachusetts General Hospital●Michigan Medicine●Nebraska Medicine●Penn Medicine●University of Washington MedicinePartners in Health has also released resources for clinicians and organizations in resource-limited settings. SPECIAL SITUATIONSPregnant and breastfeeding women — The management of pregnant and breastfeeding women with COVID-19 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Pregnant and breastfeeding women'.)People with HIV — Data on the impact of HIV infection on the natural history of COVID-19 are limited [89,90]. However, many of the comorbid conditions associated with severe COVID-19 (eg, cardiovascular disease) occur frequently among patients with HIV, and these, in addition to CD4 cell count, should be considered in risk stratification. Additionally, drug interactions with antiretroviral agents are important to assess before starting any new therapies. Otherwise, the management of COVID-19 in patients with HIV is the same as in patients without HIV; HIV should not be a reason to exclude a patient from clinical trials or other interventions [91]. Lopinavir-ritonavir is being used in trials for patients with COVID-19, although data from one randomized trial do not suggest a benefit [86]. If a patient with HIV is not on a protease inhibitor-containing regimen, it should not be changed to include a protease inhibitor outside the context of a clinical trial and without consultation with an expert in the management of HIV [92].SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019; it has subsequently spread rapidly, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The optimal approach to treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Our approach is based on limited data and evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Many patients with known or suspected COVID-19 have mild disease that does not warrant hospital-level care. Having such patients recover at home is preferred, as it prevents additional potential exposures in the health care setting and reduces burden on the health care system. Identification of patients who can be managed in the outpatient setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●The evaluation of hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 should assess for features associated with severe illness and identify organ dysfunction or other comorbidities that could complicate potential therapy (table 2). (See 'Evaluation' above.)●Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (algorithm 1). COVID-19 has been associated with thromboembolic complications. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●There are minimal data informing the risks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the setting of COVID-19. We suggest acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, if possible (Grade 2C). If NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose. We do not discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions if there are no other reasons to stop them. (See 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' above.)●Specific concern for COVID-19 should not impact the decision to start or stop angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). People who are on an ACE inhibitor or ARB for another indication should not stop their medication. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)●We make a point of continuing statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are already taking them. (See 'Statins' above.)●The optimal use of COVID-19-specific therapy is uncertain; very preliminary, unpublished trial data suggest a benefit of remdesivir, but no other agent has clearly proven effective. For most potential therapies, evidence on their use is low quality. For this reason, patients should be referred to clinical trials whenever possible. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management. (See 'Approach' above.)•For patients with nonsevere disease who have no laboratory features associated with severe disease (table 1), care is primarily supportive, with close monitoring for disease progression. If a clinical trial is available for such patients, we prioritize those with advanced age (eg, >65 years) and other comorbidities associated with risk of progressive disease (table 2). (See 'Defining disease severity' above and 'Nonsevere disease' above.)•For hospitalized patients with severe disease, we recommend remdesivir, if available (Grade 1C). In the United States, remdesivir may be available through a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization. (See 'Remdesivir' above.)•For hospitalized patients with severe disease or with laboratory features associated with severe disease (table 1) who cannot get remdesivir through emergency use authorization, we recommend referral to a clinical trial (Grade 1C). Clinical trials of remdesivir are ongoing; other investigational therapies include convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 pathway inhibitors, and other immunomodulatory agents. We also refer patients who are able to get remdesivir through emergency use authorization to clinical trials for other agents, if they allow concurrent use of remdesivir. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' above.)If neither a clinical trial nor remdesivir through emergency use authorization is available, clinicians may be able to obtain convalescent plasma for investigational use in patients with severe disease; in the United States, this can be requested through the FDA's expanded access program. (See 'Convalescent plasma' above.)When none of these options is available, we favor supportive care. In particular, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine outside the context of a clinical trial given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity (Grade 2C). We also suggest not using lopinavir-ritonavir for COVID-19 therapy outside of a clinical trial (Grade 2B). (See 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above and 'Others' above.)●Patients with severe disease often need oxygenation support. Some patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and warrant intubation with mechanical ventilation. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●Infection control is an essential component of management of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19.

It has since rapidly spread resulting in a pandemic. The World Health Organization designated the disease term COVID-19 (ie, Coronavirus Disease 2019) [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The major morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 is largely due to acute viral pneumonitis that evolves to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of patients who become critically ill due to COVID-19. Other aspects of COVID-19, and other coronavirus-related diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)GUIDELINES AND HOSPITAL POLICIES — The advice in this topic is based upon data derived from the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, emerging retrospective data in patients with COVID-19, expert opinion, and anecdotal observations of clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 in China, Italy, and Washington state (USA), where the large outbreaks have occurred. Guidelines have been issued by several societies and organizations including the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the Chinese Thoracic Society, the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS), the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health [2-8]. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)Learning from regions that have dealt with the overwhelming burden of COVID-19 to date, it is essential that all hospitals and health systems develop task forces to manage patients admitted with this disorder. This involves, but is not limited to, designating COVID-19-specific intensive care units (ICUs) and ICU teams, creating back up and expanded staffing schedules, utilizing detailed protocols for infection prevention and medical management, accessing research trials for patients with COVID-19, ensuring adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies and training, forecasting demand, and prioritizing diagnostic lab testing.EPIDEMIOLOGY — Reports suggest that among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), up to 20 percent develop severe disease requiring hospitalization [9-17]. Although rates vary, among those who are hospitalized, up to one-quarter need intensive care unit (ICU) admission, representing approximately 5 to 8 percent of the total infected population. Differences in the rates of ICU admission may relate to cultural differences in practice and admission criteria for ICU as well as differences in predisposing factors such as age and comorbidities and testing availability in the populations served.  ●China – In the Chinese cohorts, rates of ICU admission or severe illness ranged from 7 to 26 percent [10,11,16,18]. ●Italy - Consistent with the range reported in China, preliminary reports from Italy suggest that the proportion of ICU admissions were between 5 and 12 percent of the total positive SARS-CoV-2 cases, and 16 percent of all hospitalized patients [19,20]. ●United States of America – Among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, 1151 (20 percent) required mechanical ventilation [17]. In an early study of 21 critically ill patients in Washington State, USA, 81 percent of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the ICU and 71 percent were mechanically ventilated [21]. However, this high rate likely reflects the older age of the population which largely came from a nursing home in the region. A larger analysis of 2449 patients reported hospitalization rates of 20 to 31 percent and ICU admission rates of 4.9 to 11.5 percent [22].While three-quarters of critically ill patients were male in the Chinese cohorts, data from other areas are mixed with some reports suggesting an equal proportion of men and women [20,21] and other suggesting a male predominance [23,24]. CLINICAL FEATURES IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTSClinical features and complications — General clinical features of COVID-19 patients and risk factors for progression are discussed separately (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'). Discussion here is limited to clinical features in those who are critically ill.●Rate of progression – Retrospective studies of critically ill patients have suggested that among patients who develop critical illness, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), onset of dyspnea is relatively late (median 6.5 days after symptom onset), but progression to ARDS can be swift thereafter (median 2.5 days after onset of dyspnea) [10,11,21,25,26]. ●Clinical features – Among those who are critically ill, profound acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS is the dominant finding [9-11,21,23,24,26-30]. Hypercapnia is rare. Fevers tend to wax and wane during ICU admission. The need for mechanical ventilation in those who are critically ill is high ranging from 30 to 100 percent [10,21,23,24,27,30]. ●Length of stay – Early clinical reports suggest that length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay appears to be long with many patients remaining intubated for one to two weeks or longer [24]. Reports from experts in the field suggest that many patients fail early attempts at weaning (eg, within the first week), although this does not appear to predict their eventual ability to wean and extubate. Only a small proportion of patients require tracheostomy. (See 'Extubation and weaning' below and 'Tracheostomy' below.)●Complications – Common complications of COVID-19-related ARDS include acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated liver enzymes, and cardiac injury including cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. As an example, in a single-center retrospective cohort from China of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, complications included AKI (29 percent; half of whom needed renal replacement therapy), liver dysfunction (29 percent), and cardiac injury (23 percent) [10]. •Cardiac injury appears to be a late complication, developing after the respiratory illness improves. A high rate of cardiomyopathy was noted in a United States cohort (33 percent), and may relate to the older age in that population [21]. In another United States cohort in New York City, cardiac complications among mechanically ventilated patients included atrial arrhythmias (18 percent), myocardial infarction (8 percent), and heart failure (2 percent) [29]. One case series reported five patients who developed acute cor pulmonale, most of which occurred in association with hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest [31]. All cases were thought to be most likely due to pulmonary embolism (PE), although a definitive diagnosis of PE was confirmed in only one case. Cardiac complications of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)•Sepsis, shock, and multi-organ failure do occur but appear to be less common when compared with non-COVID-19-related ARDS. The need for vasoactive agents is variable, although a significant proportion need vasopressor support for hypotension (often due to sedation medications or cardiac dysfunction). In the cohort study from Wuhan, China, 35 percent of 52 patients received vasoactive agents [10]. In contrast, in the case series from New York City, 95 percent of the 130 patients who received mechanical ventilation required vasopressor support; the reasons for this were not specified [29]. •As above, acute kidney injury is common among critically ill patients with COVID-19, and many require renal replacement therapy. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Acute kidney injury'.)•Data on the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia are limited, but it does not appear to be a major feature of COVID-19. In a cohort of intubated patients from China, hospital-acquired pneumonia, in many cases with resistant pathogens, was reported in 12 percent [10]. This finding may be related to the high use of glucocorticoids for ARDS management in China. Further data are needed to elucidate the rate of superinfection in other countries.  •Lung compliance is high compared with other etiologies of ARDS and the rate of barotrauma appears to be low with only 2 percent developing pneumothorax, compared with 25 percent of those with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [10,32]. There are limited data describing the lung pathology in patients with COVID-19. Case reports from post mortem cases and patients undergoing biopsy for another reason suggest a wide variation from mononuclear inflammation to diffuse alveolar damage, classic of ARDS [33,34]. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and etiology in adults"", section on 'Pathologic stages'.)•Neurologic complications in critically ill patients are common, especially delirium or encephalopathy which manifests with prominent agitation and confusion along with corticospinal tract signs (hyperreflexia). Consistent with this, intensivists have observed that sedation requirements are high in this population, particularly immediately after intubation. In one series of 58 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, delirium/encephalopathy was present in approximately two-thirds of patients [35]. In addition, three of 13 patients who had brain MRI had an acute ischemic stroke; eight MRI studies demonstrated leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in seven patients was acellular and only one had elevated CSF protein; PCR assays of CSF were negative for the virus. It is unclear whether the neurologic complications noted in this and other reports are due to critical illness, medication effects, or represent more direct effects of cytokines or the SARS-CoV-2 virus [35-37]. Encephalitis, while reported, is rare [38]. Similarly, Guillain-Barré-barre syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has also been described in a small case series [39]. •COVID-coagulopathy is common in this population with some patients developing abnormal coagulation profiles and others developing thrombosis. These features are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●Laboratory – Laboratory findings in critically ill patients (eg leukopenia, lymphopenia, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, normal or low procalcitonin) are initially modest and similar to those with milder illness, although the procalcitonin level may be more elevated and lymphopenia more profound in critically ill patients [9,11,28]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings' and ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"" and ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)Some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin, interleukin-6), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines; these laboratory abnormalities have been associated with poor prognosis [40]. Clinical trials of anti-IL-6 agents for the treatment of COVID-19 are in progress. Further details regarding CRS are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings' and ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"" and ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.) The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies has also been described; however, they are mostly of the IgA subclass, and the clinical significance is unclear [41]. Abnormal coagulation parameters which are commonly seen in COVID-19 patients (eg, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time) are also discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"" and ""Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome"".)●Imaging – Typical imaging findings do not appear to be different in mild or severe cases of COVID-19 (eg, ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia, minimal or no pleural effusions) [10,42,43]. While imaging with chest computed tomography (CT) was commonly performed in Chinese cohorts, we prefer to avoid its use, unless necessary; if chest CT is used as a diagnostic tool, its use must be balanced with the risk to other patients and healthcare workers during the process of patient transport and time spent in the CT room. Characteristic findings on bedside lung ultrasound include thickening of the pleural line and B lines supporting alveolar consolidation. Pleural effusions are unusual [44]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.) Pathology — There are a paucity of data describing lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia in critically ill patients. Most autopsy reports describe hyaline membrane changes and microvessel thrombosis suggestive of early ARDS (ie, exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage [DAD]) [34,45-51]. Other findings include bacterial pneumonia (isolated or superimposed on DAD) and viral pneumonitis [46,50]. Less common findings include acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia (AFOP; in the late stages) [52], amyloid deposition (heart and lung), and rarely alveolar hemorrhage and vasculitis [50]. (See ""Interpretation of lung biopsy results in interstitial lung disease"", section on 'Diffuse alveolar damage'.)Evidence of pulmonary thrombosis and thromboembolism has been reported in autopsy series [46,50,51,53]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Distant organ involvement has also been seen with the demonstration of virus in organs other than the lung and, in some cases, acute tubular necrosis and a generalized thrombotic microangiopathy in the kidney [46,50]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Risk factors for progression — Age appears to be the major risk factor that predicts progression to ARDS [13,21,22,27]. Comorbidities, high fever (≥39°C), history of smoking, and select laboratory features also predict progression and death from COVID-19. Importantly, adults of any age may develop severe disease and experience adverse outcomes, especially those with comorbidities. Further details regarding the risk of disease progression are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)RESPIRATORY CARE OF THE NONINTUBATED PATIENT — Specific aspects of respiratory care relevant to deteriorating patients with COVID-19 before admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) are discussed here (table 1). These include oxygenation with low flow and high-flow systems, noninvasive ventilation and the administration of nebulized medications. For hospitalized patients who develop progressive symptoms, early admission to the ICU is prudent when feasible. Self-proning — Some experts are encouraging that the hospitalized patient spend as much time as is feasible and safe in the prone position while receiving oxygen; the rationale for this approach is based upon limited direct evidence [54,55] and anecdotal observations in the field as well as indirect evidence of its efficacy in ventilated patients. (See 'Prone ventilation' below and 'Monitoring on noninvasive modalities' below.)Oxygenation targets — The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests titrating oxygen to a target peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of ≥90 percent. For most critically ill patients, we prefer the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting a SpO2 between 90 and 96 percent, if feasible. However, some patients may warrant a lower target (eg, patients with a concomitant acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) and others may warrant a higher target (eg, pregnancy). (See ""Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Fraction of inspired oxygen'.) Low flow oxygen — For patients with COVID-19, supplemental oxygenation with a low flow system via nasal cannula or oxygen pendant (picture 1) is appropriate (ie, up to 6 L/min). Although the degree of micro-organism aerosolization at low flow rates is unknown, it is reasonable to surmise that it is minimal. Higher flows of oxygen may be administered using a simple face mask, venturi face mask, or nonrebreather mask (eg, up to 10 to 20 L/minute), but as flow increases, the risk of dispersion also increases, augmenting the contamination of the surrounding environment and staff. Many experts have patients who wear nasal cannula also wear a droplet mask, especially during transport or when staff are in the room. Data to support this practice are largely non-peer-reviewed or derived from simulation experiments but make practical sense as a maneuver to reduce the infectious risk associated with potential aerosolization [56-58]. Additional information on the provision of low flow oxygen is provided separately. (See ""Continuous oxygen delivery systems for the acute care of infants, children, and adults"".)Patients with higher oxygen requirements — As patients progress, higher amounts of oxygen are needed. Options at this point in non-COVID-19 patients are high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) or the initiation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). However, in patients with COVID-19, this decision is controversial and subject to ongoing debate [59,60]. Despite this controversy, both modalities have been used variably. In retrospective cohorts, rates for HFNC use ranged from 14 to 63 percent while 11 to 56 percent were treated with NIV [10,24,27,30]. While, there are no prospective data describing whether these modalities were successful at avoiding intubation, one retrospective study described the highest level of respiratory support in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was noninvasive modalities (HFNC and NIV) in 5.4 percent of patients and invasive ventilation in 30 percent [30].   Deciding on a modality (noninvasive or invasive ventilation) — We believe that the decision to initiate noninvasive modalities, HFNC or NIV, should be made by balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of resources; this approach should be reassessed as new data become available. We encourage the development of hospital protocols and a multidisciplinary approach, which includes respiratory therapy staff, to facilitate this decision. In patients with COVID-19 who have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and higher oxygen needs than low flow oxygen can provide, we suggest that noninvasive modalities, may be used selectively rather than proceeding directly to intubation (eg, a younger patient without comorbidities who can tolerate nasal cannulae). On the other hand, some patients may warrant avoidance of HFNC and may benefit from proceeding directly to early intubation (eg, elderly or confused patient with comorbidities and several risk factors for progression). Some experts advocate the avoidance of both modalities (ie, proceeding to early intubation if escalating beyond 6 L/min with continued hypoxemia or increased work of breathing). This is predicated on an increased risk of aerosolization and high likelihood that patients who need these modalities will ultimately, rapidly deteriorate and require mechanical ventilation (eg, within one to three days). This approach may be reasonable when resources are available. However, using this as an absolute rule may result in an excess of unnecessary intubations and place an undue load on ventilator demand as the disease surges. In addition, this is particularly problematic for patients under investigation (eg, COVID-19 testing pending), patients who have chronic nocturnal NIV requirements, patients with chronic respiratory failure who have high baseline oxygen requirements, and patients with do-not-intubate status but who might benefit otherwise from NIV or HFNC. Ultimately, these recommendations may change with time depending on the case load of COVID-19 patients in a given location.   Oxygen via high flow nasal cannula versus noninvasive ventilation — Among the noninvasive modalities, we prefer HFNC. Our preference for HFNC is based upon limited and inconsistent data, which, on balance, favor HFNC compared with NIV in patients with non-COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the details of which are provided separately (see ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure'). In addition, limited data suggest a high failure rate of NIV in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [61] and other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (see ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure NOT due to ACPE'). However, NIV may be appropriate in patients with indications that have proven efficacy; these include patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and patients with sleep disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation). These data are provided separately. (See ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'.)  Monitoring on noninvasive modalities — If HFNC or NIV is administered, vigilant monitoring of patients is warranted for progression with frequent clinical and arterial blood gas evaluation every one to two hours to ensure efficacy and safe ventilation (eg, frequent coughing may not be “safe”). We advocate a low threshold to intubate such patients, particularly if they show any signs of rapid progression. (See 'Timing' below.)Although unproven, some experts, including us, provide HFNC (or NIV) while the patient is in the prone position. Limited evidence from case reports in non-COVID patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and anecdotal evidence suggest feasibility and improvement in oxygenation in some patients [54,62,63]. Similarly, preliminary evidence supports improvements in oxygenation parameters in patients with COVID-19 receiving NIV or HFNC [64,65]. For example, in a retrospective study, 12 out of 15 COVID-19 patients treated with NIV and pronation (median total of two cycles, three hours) experienced an improvement in the peripheral oxygen saturation while the remainder either stabilized or deteriorated [64]. In another prospective study of 24 COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, a third of whom were on oxygen flow of four liters or more (including HFNC), 15 patients (63 percent) could tolerate prone positioning for more than three hours [65]. Among those who tolerated prone positioning, six (40 percent) experienced improvements in oxygenation during prone positioning but in three of those improvement was not sustained upon resupination. It remains unclear whether pronation averts intubation, accelerates recovery, or reduces mortality. Future data are warranted to identify the optimal indications for and duration of pronation, and assessment of response.Technical details regarding application of HFNC and NIV are provided separately. (See ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"" and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Practical aspects of initiation"" and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"".)Precautions for noninvasive modalities — HFNC and NIV are considered aerosol generating procedures. Thus, when HFNC or NIV is used, airborne in addition to standard precautions should be undertaken (ie, airborne infection isolation room [also known as a negative pressure room], full personal protective equipment). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●HFNC – We advocate additionally placing a surgical or N95 mask on the patient during HFNC when healthcare workers are in the room, but the value of this practice is unknown [3]. Additional precautions for HFNC that have potential to reduce risk include starting at and using the lowest effective flow rate (eg, 20 L/minute and 0.4 FiO2). Inhaled medications or gases (eg, epoprostenol, nitric oxide bronchodilators) should be avoided during HFNC. ●NIV – If NIV is initiated, a full-face mask rather than a nasal or oronasal mask is preferred to minimize particle dispersion. The mask should preferably have a good seal and not have an anti-asphyxiation valve or port. Use of a helmet has been proposed for delivering NIV to patients with COVID-19 [66]. However, experience is limited with this delivery method, especially in the United States. If NIV is used, dual limb circuitry with a filter on the expiratory limb on a critical care ventilator may decrease dispersion compared with single limb circuitry on portable devices, although data to support this are lacking. We also suggest starting with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) using the lowest effective pressures (eg, 5 to 10 cm H2O).There are few data regarding aerosolization during HFNC and NIV. In a normal lung simulation study, dispersion of air during exhalation increased with increasing HFNC flow from 65 mm (at 10 L/minute) to 172 mm (at 60 L/minute) mostly along the sagittal plane (ie, above the nostrils) [67]. Similar distances were found when CPAP was delivered via nasal pillows (up to 332 mm with CPAP 20 cm H2O). However, there was no significant leakage noted when CPAP was administered via an oronasal mask with good seal (picture 2 and picture 3). Air leak increased when connections on any device were loose. Dispersion seemed to be reduced when the simulator simulated injured lung. Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients) — Nebulizers are associated with aerosolization and potentially increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In patients with suspected or documented COVID-19, nebulized bronchodilator therapy should be reserved for acute bronchospasm (eg, in the setting of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation). Otherwise, nebulized therapy should generally be avoided, in particular for indications without a clear evidence-base; however some uses (eg, hypertonic saline for cystic fibrosis) may need to be individualized. Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) with spacer devices should be used instead of nebulizers for management of chronic conditions (eg, asthma or COPD controller therapy). Patients can use their own MDIs if the hospital does not have them on formulary.If nebulized therapy is used, patients should be in an airborne infection isolation room, and healthcare workers should use contact and airborne precautions with appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE); this includes a N95 mask with goggles and face shield or equivalent (eg, powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR] mask]) as well as gloves and gown. All non-essential personnel should leave the room during nebulization. Some experts also suggest not re-entering the room for two to three hours following nebulizer administration. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Other — Potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should inform the use of other interventions in patients with documented or suspected COVID-19: ●It is prudent to minimize the following: •Positive airway devices for chronic nocturnal ventilation support•Chest physical therapy or oscillatory devices•Oral or airway suctioning●Sputum induction should be avoided●Bronchoscopy should be avoided in spontaneously breathing patients and limited to therapeutic indications (eg, life-threatening hemoptysis, central airway stenosis)If any of these therapies are performed, similar PPE to that described for nebulizer therapy should be used. (See 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)' above and ""Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview"".) THE DECISION TO INTUBATETiming — Timing of intubation in this population is challenging. Most patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 will warrant intubation and mechanical ventilation. Delaying intubation until the patient acutely decompensates is potentially harmful to the patient and healthcare workers and is not advised. For patients with escalating oxygen requirements, we monitor clinical and gas exchange parameters every one to two hours and have a low threshold to intubate patients with the following:●Rapid progression over hours  ●Lack of improvement on >40 L/minute of high flow oxygen and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) >0.6●Evolving hypercapnia, increasing work of breathing, increasing tidal volume, worsening mental status ●Hemodynamic instability or multiorgan failureMost experts with experience managing COVID-19 patients suggest “early” intubation. However, the definition of what constitutes “early” is unclear. Use of noninvasive means are traditionally used to avoid intubation. However, their use is subject to controversy in patients with COVID-19 (see 'Patients with higher oxygen requirements' above). Clinicians should communicate closely and regularly about the potential for intubation in patients that are being followed and treated noninvasively so that the transition for intubation can be smooth and rapid once it has been identified that the patient needs intubation.  Precautions — Intubation is the highest risk procedure for droplet dispersion in patients with COVID-19 [59,68]. The following discussion is suitable for patients outside the operating room (eg, intensive care unit [ICU] and emergency department) (table 2). ●We are proponents of the development of intubation kits and intubation checklists for performing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in this population (figure 1). ●Attention should be paid to donning full contact and airborne personal protective equipment (PPE) (figure 2 and figure 3) [59]. Appropriate PPE includes a fit-tested disposable N95 respirator mask (picture 4), with eye protection or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), also known as an isolation suit (picture 5 and picture 6). Also included are gown, caps and beard covers, protective footwear, neck covering, and gloves (using the double glove technique). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●Intubation should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room, if possible.●Intubation should be performed by the most qualified individual (eg, anesthesiologist) since delayed intubation with multiple attempts may prolong dispersion and place the patient at risk of a respiratory arrest.  ●Anecdotally, most experts suggest optimizing preoxygenation with nonaerosol-generating means (eg, avoidance of high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannula) and intubation using video laryngoscopy. In patients previously on high flow oxygen, some experts switch to 100 percent nonrebreather masks for preoxygenation. ●When manual bag mask ventilation (BMV) is needed, switching the mask to a supraglottic device for manual bagging is appropriate. When feasible, BMV should be minimized before and after intubation, and a bacterial/viral high efficiency hydrophobic filter should be placed between the facemask and breathing circuit or resuscitation bag. Having a pre-prepared bag-mask with filter attached in every room with a COVID-19 patient is prudent. Using a two-person technique for an adequate face mask seal is also suggested.●Clamping the endotracheal tube (ETT) for connections and disconnections is appropriate (eg, capnography testing following intubation), only if the patient is NOT spontaneously breathing. ●The ventilator and ventilator circuitry should be ready in advance with preplanned settings already entered so that as soon as the ETT is placed and confirmed with capnography, it can be connected directly to the ETT without additional manual bagging. In addition, if feasible, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy should be prepared and attached to the ventilator tubing in advance in order to avoid unnecessary disconnection for their placement at a later point in time. The expiratory limb on the ventilator should have a HEPA filter to decrease contamination of the ventilator and environment and protect staff when changing limb circuitry. ●To minimize exposure, bundling intubation with other procedures is appropriate as is bundling the chest radiograph for ETT and central venous catheter placement.●Doffing should follow strict procedure and some experts also advocate for the use of viricidal wipes for areas of exposed skin during intubation (eg, neck) (figure 3).New proposals are emerging for novel barrier protections for intubation. In one such pilot study, manually performing intubation inside a transparent box was described (“aerosol box”) [69]. The box was designed so that it could be placed over a patient’s head allowing intubation to be performed through two circular ports on the cephalad side of the box. In a simulation experiment, cough was approximated using a latex balloon and fluorescent dye. Use of the box was associated with significant reduction in aerosol deposition to the individual performing intubation, their PPE clothing, and the surrounding environment, when compared with the same simulation without the box. While proposed as an adjunct to protection, restriction of hand movements may be encountered during airway manipulation that would necessitate abandoning the procedure and the simulation may not accurately mimic the aerosolization behavior of virus particles. Such devices are not yet commercially available.  Detailed guidance regarding intubation in the operating room, optimal personal protective equipment, and procedural details regarding intubation itself are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"" and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19' and ""Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults"" and ""Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room"" and ""The decision to intubate"" and ""Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room"" and ""Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside of the operating room"".)VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME — Most patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated appear to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Accurate data on duration of ventilation are limited but suggest prolonged mechanical ventilation for two weeks or more (table 1). All of the steps discussed below should proceed as resources allow. Whether different phases of COVID-19 pneumonitis require different ventilatory strategies is unclear. One school of thought is that in the early phase of COVID-19, severe hypoxemia is associated with high compliance and low alveolar recruitability (atypical ARDS), while in the later phase, severe hypoxemia is associated with low lung compliance and high recruitability (classic ARDS) [70,71]. However, this hypothesis, remains unproven and optimal ventilatory strategies based upon it are unclear. Until further data are available, we prefer a strategy that promotes lung protection as outlined in the sections below.Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) — As for all patients with ARDS, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who develop ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation should receive LTVV targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW; range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW (table 3 and table 4)). We typically use a volume-limited assist control mode, beginning with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW, which targets a plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤30 cm H2O, and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table (table 5). This approach is based upon several randomized trials and meta-analyses that have reported improved mortality from LTVV in patients with ARDS. The experience among Chinese, Italian, and United States cohorts is that this approach is also beneficial in this population. Modifications to or deviations from this mechanical ventilation strategy may be required in the setting of severe hypercapnia or ventilator dyssynchrony (figure 4). (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Patients who are not improving or deteriorating'.)Anecdotal reports suggest that the COVID-19 ARDS phenotype is one of severe hypoxemia that is responsive to high PEEP with relatively high lung compliance such that Pplat ≤30 cm H2O is not difficult to achieve. As a consequence, we and other clinicians have a low threshold to start with higher than usual levels of PEEP (eg, 10 to 15 cm H2O).Expanded details on LTVV and other ventilator strategies in ARDS are provided separately. (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"".)   We believe that oxygenation goals in critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be similar to those in nonventilated patients (ie, peripheral oxygen saturation between 90 and 96 percent (see 'Oxygenation targets' above)). However, in patents with COVID-19, some experts use a higher peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) goal [7]. The rationale for this approach is that it may reduce the frequency of ventilator adjustments that require staff entry into the room, thereby reducing the risk to healthcare staff, although data are lacking to support it.Reflecting the practice of LTVV, one retrospective Italian cohort reported that the median level of PEEP was 14 cm H2O (interquartile range [IQR] 12 to 16 cm H2O) [24]. Ninety percent of patients required an FiO2 >0.5, and the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 160 (IQR, 114 to 220).Failure of low tidal volume ventilation — For patients with COVID-19 that fail to achieve adequate oxygenation with LTVV, we agree with other experts in the field who have chosen prone ventilation as the preferred next step. For its application, we use similar criteria to those in non-COVD-19 patients (ie, partial arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2:FiO2] ratio <150 mmHg, a FiO2 ≥0.6, and PEEP ≥5 cm H2O; excessively high airway pressures; or recalcitrant hypoxemia), although some experts use a higher PaO2:FiO2 ratio, given the good response seen in this population.  Prone ventilation — Our preference for using prone ventilation is based on its known efficacy in patients with ARDS as well as limited and anecdotal observations of intensivists in the field who have noted that unlike patients who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), patients with COVID-19-related ARDS respond well to this maneuver [72]. Those who are experienced in ventilating patients with COVID-19-related ARDS also promote ventilating patients prone for as long as is feasible without prematurely returning the patient to the supine position (ie, 12 to 16 hours prone per day) and to perform the maneuver at change of shift when sufficient staff are available. The utmost care should be taken to avoid ventilator disconnections during proning and the number of personnel should be limited to that required for turning. This video which describes the prone procedure is freely available. Additional details regarding the efficacy, contraindications (table 6) and application (table 7) of prone ventilation are provided separately. (See ""Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Ventilator strategies to maximize alveolar recruitment'.) The good response to prone positioning may be due to preserved lung compliance in this population compared with patients who develop ARDS from other etiologies. Lung compliance is the change in lung volume for a given pressure. It can be measured using the following equations: lung compliance (C) = change in lung volume (V) / change in transpulmonary pressure (alveolar pressure [Palv] – pleural pressure [Ppl]); static lung compliance = tidal volume / Pplat – PEEP. The normal lung compliance is approximately 200 mL/cm H2O and in general compliance >50 mL/cm H2O has been noted by clinicians who have experienced ventilating patients with COVID-19. Optimal timing and criteria for discontinuing prone ventilation is unclear and should be performed on an individualized basis. It is not unreasonable to use criteria similar to that in studies that have shown benefit in non-COVID-related ARDS (eg PaO2:FiO2 ≥150 mmHg, FiO2 ≤0.6, PEEP ≤10 cm H2O) maintained for at least four hours after the end of the last prone session) [73].Additional measures — Additional options for patients in whom prone ventilation fails include the following:●Recruitment and high PEEP – Recruitment maneuvers and high PEEP strategies (table 8) may be performed to address severe hypoxemia [8]; data supporting their use in non COVID-19-related ARDS is described separately. (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Ventilator strategies to maximize alveolar recruitment'.)●Pulmonary vasodilators – Pulmonary vasodilators may improve ventilation-perfusion mismatch in patients with severe hypoxemia (eg, PaO2:FiO2 <100) and may be especially helpful in those with decompensated or acute pulmonary arterial hypertension [8]. However, pulmonary vasodilators do not improve mortality in all-cause ARDS and should not be used instead of evidence-based therapies such as prone positioning. Namely, in a patient whose PaO2:FiO2 ratio meets proning criteria, but numerically improves with the initiation of pulmonary vasodilators, prone positioning should not be withheld. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Investigational agents'.)The two most commonly used agents are inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) and aerosolized epoprostenol, which are administered by continuous inhalation. After initiating iNO or epoprostenol, the response is typically noted within a few hours (eg, 10 percent reduction in FiO2 requirement). The choice of agent is typically institution dependent based on local expertise and cost. While some centers use a single agent, other centers use an initial trial of iNO (eg, 30 parts per million [PPM] for one hour) to determine responsiveness; responders are continued on iNO or transitioned to inhaled epoprostenol. iNO may be preferred since it is associated with a less frequent need to change filters with resultant reduction in the risk to the respiratory healthcare provider. Inhaled vasodilators should only be administered through a closed system and require skilled personnel for their use. Potential risks and challenges with COVID-19 patients include aerosolization and clogging of bacterial/viral filters used in ventilator circuits, particularly with epoprostenol. Further details regarding their use are described separately. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Nitric oxide' and ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Prostacyclin' and ""Inhaled nitric oxide in adults: Biology and indications for use"", section on 'Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure'.) ●Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) – NMBAs may be reserved for patients with refractory hypoxemia or ventilator dyssynchrony. We do not favor their routine use in any patient with ARDS since data on outcomes are conflicting. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Paralysis (neuromuscular blockade)' and ""Neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients: Use, agent selection, administration, and adverse effects"".) ●Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – While the World Health Organization suggests ECMO as a rescue strategy, we only use it in those who fail prone ventilation and the other evidence-based medical strategies listed above. In addition, ECMO is not universally available. As many hospitals choose to cohort patients in COVID-19-only intensive care units (ICUs), there may also be the challenge of delivering ECMO in ICUs that do not routinely care for ECMO patients; this would require the recruitment of additional specialized nursing and perfusionist staff. ECMO can also reduce the lymphocyte count and raise the interleukin-6 level, thereby interfering with the interpretation of these laboratory results [74]. (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Use of rescue strategies has varied among centers. Among 66 mechanically-ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Boston, Massachusetts, 31 (47 percent) underwent prone positioning, 18 (27 percent) were treated with inhaled vasodilator, and 3 (5 percent) received ECMO; overall mortality was 27 percent at a minimum follow-up of 30 days [75]. In a single-center retrospective cohort of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, approximately 12 percent received prone ventilation and 12 percent received ECMO [10]. In contrast, in the original cohort of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, of the 17 patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, 24 percent were treated with ECMO. Similarly, in an Italian cohort, only 1 percent of critically ill patients received ECMO [24]. Additional ventilator precautions — We recommend tight seals for all ventilator circuitry and equipment. For patients who have a tracheostomy, similar recommendations apply. Although the efficacy is unproven, some experts suggest placing the ventilator and intravenous (IV) line monitors outside the room, when feasible (eg, through a wall port). This allows frequent ventilator adjustments while simultaneously decreasing the risk of exposure to staff; although the efficacy of such maneuvers is unproven. It is prudent to avoid unnecessary disconnection with the endotracheal tube (ETT) in ventilated patients with COVID-19 in order to avoid derecruitment and unnecessary exposure of virus to the environment. For example, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy are preferred, if resources allow. If disconnection is necessary (eg, during transfer when portable ventilators are used or manual bagging), the ETT should be temporarily clamped during disconnection and unclamped after reconnection. This is considered an aerosolizing procedure in which case an airborne infection isolation room is preferable but is not always feasible.Other infection precautions include use of dual limb ventilator circuitry with filters placed at the exhalation outlets as well as heat moisture exchange (HME) systems rather than heated humification of single limb circuits. HME should be placed between the exhalation port and the ETT (figure 5 and figure 6). (See ""The ventilator circuit"".)It is particularly important to adhere to the standard practice of maintaining the ETT cuff pressure between 25 and 30 cm H2O so that a tight seal exists between the cuff and the tracheal wall. (See ""Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients"", section on 'Maintain optimal cuff pressure'.)All ventilators should have appropriate filters in place and agreed upon filter change schedule (eg, every six hours). The ventilator should be wiped down after every filter change. Although an airborne isolation room is ideal, if not feasible, patients can be ventilated in a non-isolation room but need to be transported to an airborne isolation room when aerosol generating procedures take place (eg, extubation, bronchoscopy). Having a protocol in place for transport is prudent. INTERVENTIONS — Ventilated patients require frequent evaluation and develop complications that require intervention. Details relevant to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are included in this section and mostly relate to infectious precautions. In a biodistribution study of 1070 specimens obtained from 205 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens showed the highest positive rates (93 percent), followed by sputum (72 percent), nasal swabs (63 percent), fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (46 percent), pharyngeal swabs (32 percent), feces (29 percent), and blood (1 percent). No urine specimens tested positive [76]. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in several specimens, although the reported rates in this study may have been determined by the severity of illness of the individual tested. In a systematic review of 10 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to healthcare workers, endotracheal intubation had the highest risk (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 2.3-18.9), followed by noninvasive ventilation (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.8), tracheostomy (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5-11.5), and bag-mask ventilation [77]. Other procedures were associated with a lower or insignificant risk of transmission but it is not known whether they can be applied to SARS-CoV-2. For example, duration of close contact during aerosolizing procedures and precautions used were not described. Collection of respiratory specimens in the intubated patient — Some intubated patients require upper or lower respiratory tract sampling for diagnostic purposes (eg, diagnosis of COVID-19 or ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]). Technically, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs do not have to be taken under airborne precautions. However, we prefer to obtain naso- and oropharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates under airborne precautions in the intensive care unit (ICU). Nonbronchoscopic alveolar lavage (“mini-BAL”) may also be performed as an alternative to bronchoscopy, although experience in this procedure is not universal among ICUs. If mini-BAL is performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, use of smaller aliquots of lavage fluid is prudent (eg, three 10 mL aliquots to obtain 2 to 3 mL of fluid). (See ""Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia"", section on 'Invasive respiratory sampling'.)Bronchoscopy — We agree with the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) that bronchoscopy should have a limited role for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and should only be performed for this indication when upper respiratory samples are negative (ie, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, or non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage) and the suspicion remains high. Bronchoscopy may also be performed when another diagnosis is being considered and a bronchoscopic sample would change management (eg, suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii in an immunosuppressed patient) or when therapeutic bronchoscopy is indicated (eg, life-threatening hemoptysis or airway stenosis).  Bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure and should only be performed when necessary and likely to change management. Bronchoscopy through an established airway (eg, endotracheal tube [ETT]) likely carries less risk than bronchoscopy in a spontaneously breathing patient. In patients with COVID-19, bronchoscopy should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room. Airborne precautions and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned before entering the room. Using PPE similar to that described for intubation is appropriate. (See 'The decision to intubate' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Using ETTs with inline adapters for bronchoscopy is ideal to prevent disconnection from the ventilator and aerosolization. If bronchoscopy is needed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, then we suggest small aliquots of 10 mL to obtain 2 to 3 mL of lavage fluid placed in a sterile leak-proof container. Clamping suction tubing or turning off suction after the sample has been obtained before disconnecting the sample from the device is also prudent. Specimens should be in a double zip-locked sealed plastic bag, handled with the usual precautions, and labelled clearly as “COVID-19.”We prefer the use of disposable bronchoscopes, although these are not universally available. For nondisposable equipment, we recommend cleaning the suction channels with standard cleaning solutions typically used for highly infectious material. We also suggest covering or sealing any vessel containing the bronchoscope during transport after use and wiping down the transport cart and bronchoscope display tower before leaving the room. Wipe down solution should be hydrogen peroxide or equivalent and should be left wet on all surfaces for at least one minute. Extubation and weaning — Patients are often ready for extubation while they remain infectious, and because extubation is frequently associated with some coughing, it is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. Similar to intubation, we encourage the use of extubation protocols and check lists specific to each institution.●Weaning – Readiness for extubation should follow standard practice of performing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). However, COVID-specific approaches include the following:•Equipment – We suggest using closed systems and not using a T-piece trial for SBTs.•SBTs – To reduce the risk of reintubation following extubation, we prefer a higher degree of readiness in patients with COVID-19. This practice varies and may include higher criteria for passing an SBT. For example, some experts use lower pressure support ventilation [PSV] parameters (eg, 0 to 5 cm H2O) rather than the typical 7 cm H2O during the trial while others promote SBT for longer periods (eg, two to four hours rather than the typical two hours). The rationale for altered criteria is based upon the observation that patients with COVID-19 are intubated for longer periods than non-COVID-patients [24] and anecdotal evidence that suggests a high volume of secretions and airway edema; all of these factors place the patient at high risk of post extubation respiratory failure requiring reintubation. In addition, we prefer extubating patients directly to low-flow oxygen rather than high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae (HFNC) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV), which may risk virus aerosolization. (See ""Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing"" and ""Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation"", section on 'Spontaneous breathing trial' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Cuff leak test – Whether the cuff leak test (CLT) should be performed routinely prior to extubation is unclear. However, its performance may be guided by clinical suspicion for upper airway edema (eg, fluid overload) or the presence of risk factors for post extubation stridor (eg, prolonged intubation ≥6 days, age >80 years, large endotracheal tube, traumatic intubation). Performing the cuff leak test should be weighed against the potential risk of aerosolization, and similar to extubation, it should be preferentially done in an airborne isolation room. In our institution, we routinely administer glucocorticoids (eg, methylprednisolone 20 mg intravenously every four hours for a total of four doses) to most patients with COVID-19 before extubation and only extubate those in whom the CLT is positive after glucocorticoids. We base this practice upon the high rate of airway edema noted in our population but understand that practice may vary depending upon the population served. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Cuff leak'.)●Extubation – We prefer to perform extubation in an airborne isolation room. Respiratory therapists and others in the room during extubation should adhere to airborne precautions including N95 masks with eye protection or equivalent. In general, only two people are needed and extra staff outside the room should be available to help with additional equipment. Some experts use medications to decrease coughing (eg, lidocaine via ETT, low-dose opioid bolus, dexmedetomidine, remifentanil if available), although data to support the routine use of anti-tussives are limited. In the ICU, close communication with a clinician experienced in intubation regarding the occurrence of extubation in a COVID-19 patient is prudent, in case rapid reintubation is needed, particularly for patients pre-designated as having a difficult airway.Both low-flow and high-flow oxygen systems should be set up and readily available. We drape the patient’s chest and face with a plastic cover to provide barrier protection between the patient and the operator (eg, a plastic poncho). We typically put the ventilator in standby mode (or switch off) immediately prior to extubation. After balloon deflation, extra care should be taken during extubation to keep the inline suction catheter engaged during cuff deflation and to have another handheld suction catheter available for the removal of pharyngeal and oral sections. The endotracheal tube should be removed as smoothly as is feasible during inspiration, and disposed of into a biohazard plastic bag bundled together with the ventilator tubing, the plastic drape, and tape/ETT holders, and inline suction catheter. The bag is sealed and disposed of immediately. Further details regarding extubation are provided separately. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Extubation equipment and technique'.)●Post-extubation care – The patient is monitored following the procedure. The threshold to reintubate patients with postextubation respiratory failure should be low. Postextubation care should support the application of supplemental oxygen at the lowest fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) possible, preferably via low flow nasal canula. Because patients are often extubated while they remain infectious, we would advise adhering to a similar approach to oxygen delivery as before intubation. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Postextubation management' and 'Oxygenation targets' above.)The procedure for palliative extubation should be similar except care following extubation also includes palliative medication and cessation of neuromuscular blockade. Precautions for extubation in the OR are provided separately. (See ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)  Tracheostomy — Reports from experts in the field suggest that many patients fail early attempts at weaning (eg, within the first week), although this does not appear to predict their eventual ability to wean and extubate. However, some patients require tracheostomy (in our experience <10 percent of ICU admissions). ●Indications – Indications appear to be similar to non-COVID patients (eg, failed extubation, secretion management, airway edema, neurological impairment such as that which impairs airway protection).●Timing – The optimal timing for tracheostomy is unknown in COVID-19 patients. In non-COVID patients, changes in practice have led to most intensivists performing tracheostomy around day 7 to 10 following initial intubation. Although most intensivists perform tracheostomy approximately 7 to 10 days following initial intubation in patients without COVID-19, it seems reasonable to defer tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 beyond this time frame. COVID-19 patients appear to require mechanical ventilation longer than other patients (eg, two to three weeks), but can still be successfully extubated after this point.  ●Procedure – Tracheostomy is considered a high risk procedure for aerosolization. •Both open and percutaneous tracheostomy procedures are acceptable in COVID patients. •The exact procedure should be determined in advance and at the discretion of the operator with the minimum number of personnel. •To minimize cough, neuromuscular blockade is prudent. •It is preferable that the procedure be done at the bedside in an airborne isolation room. The operator should wear appropriate PPE similar to other aerosol generating procedures. The tracheostomy tube should have the syringe attached for immediate balloon inflation once inserted. In addition, adapters with inline suction catheters attached is also appropriate. (See 'Precautions' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)•Procedures such as open suctioning, dressing changes, inner cannula care, and tracheostomy changes are also considered as aerosol-generating. Thus, post tracheostomy care should also occur in an airborne isolation room, if feasible (if not, consider a portable HEPA-filtration unit). Novel barrier protections for performing tracheostomy have been proposed. In one report, tracheostomy was performed under an aerosol-reduction cover with a high-efficiency particulate air filtration unit placed close to the surgical field [78]. However, no description of aerosol deposition was provided. ●Prolonged weaning – Tracheostomy collar trials can be safely done in an airborne isolation room with resumption of ventilation and a closed loop system following the trial. However, some institutions use a portable HEPA filter to generate negative pressure in a room or use closed systems and dual limb circuitry with a HEPA filter attached to the exhalation limb to minimize environmental contamination. A surgical mask over the tracheostomy itself may also theoretically limit droplet spread.  Once a patient can breathe for 24 hours on a tracheostomy collar (or similar), they can undergo trials of a speaking valve and “capping” with the balloon deflated. Placing a speaking valve and capping would be considered aerosol generating so airborne precautions are warranted. However, once a speaking valve is in place or the tracheostomy is capped, aerosolization is less of a consideration and is the equivalent of a patient with a cough and on low flow oxygen and the patients may wear a mask over their nose and mouth. Decannulation is considered an aerosol-generating procedure, and provided the patient remains infectious, all the usual airborne precautions should be taken.  ●Repeat testing – Some institutions perform repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine when to discontinue infection control precautions and inform resource allocation. Whether tracheal or nasopharyngeal swabs should be used for this purpose is uncertain. If patients are tested and have a positive test, we continue precautions until two tests collected 24 hours apart are negative; however, it remains uncertain whether viral RNA detection during recovery reflects transmissible infection. (See 'Precautions' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.) .  Further details regarding tracheostomy are provided separately. (See ""Overview of tracheostomy"".)Cardiopulmonary resuscitation — In the event of a cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should proceed with all members of the team wearing appropriate PPE. Practicing a test run of a COVID-19 patient cardiac arrest is prudent. Bag-mask ventilation should be avoided (if feasible); the ventilator can be used instead to deliver a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute (bpm). Guidance for advanced cardiac life support and CPR in patients who are prone and cannot be returned to the supine position is provided separately. (See ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)' and ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"".)Other interventions — Guidance is lacking regarding other procedures commonly performed in the ICU. Many intubated patients have routine indications for central venous and arterial access for monitoring and for vasoactive drug infusion. Grouping standard procedures such as central venous catheter and arterial lines immediately following intubation is appropriate to minimize the frequency of exposure. The transmission risk of blood is unknown but likely to be low [76]. Significant pleural effusions and barotrauma appear to be unusual as a manifestation of COVID-19. In general, emergently indicated procedures and interventions should be performed as indicated, with appropriate infectious precautions. (See 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)  Transfer of COVID-19 patients should be limited to necessary trips (eg, imaging for a diagnosis that would change management, travel to an airborne isolation room for high risk aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation and extubation). SUPPORTIVE CARE — General supportive care of the critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is similar to that in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to other causes and is discussed in detail separately. Select issues pertinent to COVID-19 are discussed in the sections below. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Supportive care'.) Routine measures — The supportive care of mechanically ventilated patients that also apply to patients with COVID-19 are provided in several linked topics. However, potential differences that may pertain to COVID-19 patients are discussed in this section:Venous thromboembolism prevention — We agree with the American Society of Hematology and the Society of Critical Care Medicine that routine pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is warranted, preferably with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; eg, enoxaparin 40 mg SC once daily), unless there is a contraindication (eg, bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia). (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults"".)Because the risk of VTE appears to be higher than usual in this population, use of more aggressive VTE prophylaxis in the form of increased intensity of a pharmacologic agent (eg, enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, unfractionated heparin 7500 units every eight hours) and/or the addition of a mechanical device is prudent. Markedly elevated D-dimer levels, which correlate with a poor prognosis, are used by some experts to guide intensification of anticoagulation (eg, >6 times the upper limit of normal). For patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute, enoxaparin should be reduced to 30 mg daily or changed to unfractionated heparin depending on the severity of kidney impairment and patient weight. Fondaparinux is appropriate in those with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We believe that administering therapeutic anticoagulation (as a form of prophylaxis) may be assessed on an individual basis. However the indications for therapeutic anticoagulation, outside of documented VTE, are unclear but may include those with presumed VTE (eg, sudden unexplained deterioration in oxygenation or hemodynamic instability, acute cor pulmonale) and clotting of vascular devices (eg, venous, arterial devices, and hemodialysis devices).  Detailed descriptions of the VTE risk and management of COVID-19 patients with hypercoagulability are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)Sedation and analgesia — Anecdotal evidence suggests that requirements for sedation and analgesia appear high in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and that heavy use of sedatives and analgesic medication is required for ventilator synchrony. In our practice, we target a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS (table 9)) of -1 to -2 (or similar on a different scoring system), and in patients with ventilator dyssynchrony, a RASS of -2 to -3. RASS of -4 to -5 are targeted in those with severe dyssynchrony and those requiring neuromuscular blockade. For those requiring intravenous (IV) infusions, propofol and fentanyl are generally the preferred agents. However, shortages of sedatives may influence the choice of agent. We also quickly transition to oral medications, provided that fluid resuscitation is adequate (eg, oxycodone, hydromorphone, lorazepam, diazepam). Further details regarding indications, daily awakening, protocols, and dosing are provided separately. (See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal"" and ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects"" and ""Pain control in the critically ill adult patient"".)Others — Other supportive measures are included here.●Nutritional support – The same principles of nutrition in non COVID-19 critically ill patients should be applied to critically-ill COVID-19 patients. We are not proponents of extra protein supplementation, vitamin C or D supplementation, or trace element supplementation over and above the usual recommended daily doses. (See ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview"" and ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition"" and ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition"".)●Glucose control. (See ""Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness"".)●Stress ulcer prophylaxis. (See ""Stress ulcers in the intensive care unit: Diagnosis, management, and prevention"" and ""Management of stress ulcers"".)●Hemodynamic monitoring. (See ""Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults"" and ""Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults"" and ""Novel tools for hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill patients with shock"".)●Fever management. (See ""Fever in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Outcomes'.)●Early physical therapy. (See ""Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)"", section on 'Prevention and treatment'.)●Ventilator-associated pneumonia precautions. (See ""Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"".)Monitoring for complications — Critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be followed routinely for the development of complications associated with critical illness from COVID-19 or extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only essential personnel should enter the rooms of infected patients when performing daily examinations, care, and procedures. Common complications include acute kidney injury, mild transaminitis, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusions, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and superinfection (eg, ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]) (see 'Clinical features and complications' above). We suggest that daily laboratory studies include complete blood count with differential, chemistries, liver function and coagulation studies, arterial blood gases, ferritin level, D-dimer level, and lactate dehydrogenase. Serial measurement of cardiac troponins and a low threshold transthoracic echocardiogram may be helpful to evaluate for suspected cardiac injury.Daily chest radiographs are not recommended routinely for mechanically ventilated patients with or without COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated, chest radiographs should only be performed when there is an indication (eg, catheter- or endotracheal tube [ETT]-placement or a relevant clinical change). Chest computed tomography and other imaging should be limited to those in whom testing would change management. This rationale is based upon the increased risk of viral shedding with procedures that require transfer out of the intensive care unit (ICU). (See ""Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients"", section on 'Reassessment of position'.) Fluid and electrolytes management — Unless patients have sepsis or volume depletion from high fever or gastrointestinal losses, we prefer conservative fluid management typical of that advised for patients with ARDS. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Fluid management' and ""Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"", section on 'Intravenous fluids (first three hours)' and ""Treatment of severe hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults"".)The management of patients who present with septic shock due to COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with septic shock from other causes. (See ""Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"".)Glucocorticoids — We agree with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) that glucocorticoids should not be routinely administered to patients with COVID-19, unless there is a separate evidence-based indication (eg, asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation, refractory septic shock, and adrenal insufficiency). However, their administration in critically ill patients with COVID-19-related ARDS is controversial. Based on data suggesting potential benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with all-cause ARDS, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) provides a conditional, weak recommendation in favor of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19 who have severe ARDS (eg, patients with a partial arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2:FiO2] <100 mmHg). Although we also weakly recommend glucocorticoids in moderate to severe “all cause” ARDS (ie, non COVID-19-related ARDS) who fail low tidal volume ventilation, we do not suggest administering them routinely in the setting of COVID-19 and ARDS (see ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'). The rationale for not administering glucocorticoids in this population is that the data supporting any benefit did not include a sufficient proportion of patients with viral pneumonia to inform safety (eg, patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East Respiratory syndrome [MERS], or influenza); this is especially important since data in patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia were conflicting and some suggested harm [79-82]. If clinicians choose to administer glucocorticoids, the SCCM suggests that they should begin within the first 14 days, doses should be low, and courses should be short (eg, intravenous dexamethasone 20 mg IV once daily for five days, then 10 mg once daily for five days). Data in COVID-19 patients are limited to a single retrospective Chinese cohort, where methylprednisolone administration reduced the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients who did not receive methylprednisolone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38; 95% CI 0.2-0.71) [27]. However, these data are fundamentally flawed and new data gathered prospectively should shed light on this controversial issue. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)As noted above, management of patients who present with shock due to COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with septic shock from other causes (see 'Fluid and electrolytes management' above). Low dose glucocorticoids are not routinely advised for septic shock. In the setting of COVID-19 and shock, we reserve low dose glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone 200 to 400 mg/day in divided doses) for selected patients with refractory shock, in accordance with guidelines [7]. Low dose glucocorticoids are not routinely advised for non-refractory septic shock. The use of glucocorticoids in septic shock is discussed separately. (See ""Glucocorticoid therapy in septic shock in adults"", section on 'Administration'.)Nebulized medication — Nebulization is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. For patients with COVID-19 who are intubated and require bronchodilators for an evidence-based indication (eg, acute bronchospasm from asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation), we prefer the use of in-line metered dose inhalers (MDIs; ie, pressurized inhalers) rather than administration via a standard jet or vibrating mesh nebulizer due to the lower risk of aerosolization associated with MDIs [83,84]. For medications that can only be administered via a nebulizer, consideration should be given to stopping the medication if it is not essential for acute care (eg, inhaled colistin for patients with bronchiectasis) or using an MDI alternative, if available on formulary (eg, tobramycin capsule inhaler). Consideration should be given to the patient using their own supply if MDIs are not on formulary. Placement of a filter at the expiratory port of the ventilation circuit during nebulization is prudent to minimize aerosolization into the room. Ideally, patients who require nebulizers, should be in an airborne infection isolation room. Only the healthcare staff necessary for nebulizer administration (eg, respiratory therapists or nurse) should be in the room for the initiation of the procedure and airborne precautions similar to those for intubation should be taken. (See 'The decision to intubate' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Investigational COVID-19 agents — Several investigational agents have been proposed and individual institutions should work with their pharmacists and clinical researchers to enroll patients in clinical trials. We suggest the development of protocols by individual ICUs for the off-label use of investigational agents. This area is rapidly evolving and is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Management of co-infections and comorbidities — Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are intubated are at risk for developing VAP and other infections typical of all critically ill and/or intubated patients (eg, central line or urinary tract infections). When treating co-infections, potential drug interactions with any investigational COVID-19 agent should be assessed. Infectious disease experts should be involved early in the management of COVID-19 patients who are critically ill. Further details regarding management of chronic medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and angiotensin receptor inhibitors are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Managing chronic medications'.)SPECIAL POPULATIONS — There are no specific recommendations for pregnant women who are critically-ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. Management should be similar to uninfected patients. Issues regarding transmission and risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women is described separately.

In patients with sickle cell disease who are critically-ill with COVID-19 in whom acute chest syndrome is contributing to their illness, consideration of early exchange transfusions and surveillance for the development of acute pulmonary hypertension is prudent [85]. (See ""Acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease"", section on 'COVID-19'.)Issues that arise for other populations are provided in the following links:●Renal issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"")●Cardiac issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"")●Airway management and operating room issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"")●Cancer care (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"")PROGNOSISMortality — Early data are emerging describing outcomes from COVID-19 in critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2,9-11,23,24,26-28]. Mortality appears lower than that in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The mortality from COVID-19 appears driven by the presence of severe ARDS, and is approximately 50 percent (range 16 to 78 percent).●In a single-center retrospective cohort of 52 critically ill Chinese patients with COVID-19, 62 percent had died by 28 days with a median duration of only seven days from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to death [10]. Among the 20 patients who survived, three remained on mechanical ventilation, three were receiving noninvasive mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC), and six were receiving low flow oxygen. ●In a retrospective cohort of 201 Chinese patients with COVID-19, the mortality was 52 percent among those who developed ARDS [27]. Among those who received mechanical ventilation, 66 percent died, 21 percent were discharged and 13 percent remained hospitalized. ●In a preliminary study of 21 critically ill patients in the United States, by day 5, 67 percent of critically ill patients had died, 24 percent remained critically ill, and 9.5 percent were discharged from the ICU [21]. ●In an Italian cohort of 1591 patients, the ICU morality was 26 percent, but a significant proportion remained in the ICU at the time of the publication, which may have underestimated the true mortality [24]. Higher mortality was initially reported in males compared with females but this may have been due to the predominance of males affected with COVID-19 in the Chinese cohorts [9-11,27,28]; a similar difference has been noted in the preliminary reports from Italy but not from Washington state, USA [20,21]. Risk factors for death — Across countries, the consistent major risk factor associated with death in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is older age [10,11,19,22,24,26,27,86,87]. In two Chinese retrospective cohorts, death from ARDS was more likely to occur in those of older age ≥64 years (hazard ratio [HR] 6.17; 95% 3.26-11.67) [10,27]. Preliminary reports from Italy and the United States are reporting similar outcomes [19,20,22]. Other risk factors associated with death among critically ill patients include the following [10,11,19,22,24,26,27,88]:●The development of ARDS, particularly severe ARDS, and the need for mechanical ventilation●Comorbidities (eg, chronic cardiac and pulmonary conditions, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease)●Markers of inflammation or coagulation (eg, D-dimer level >1 microg/mL admission, elevated fibrin degradation products, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times)●Select laboratory studies (eg, worsening lymphopenia, neutrophilia)The rapidity of symptom progression does not appear to predict a worse outcome [10]While high fever was associated with a higher likelihood of developing ARDS (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.11-2.84), it appears to be associated with a lower likelihood of death (HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21-0.82) [10,27], a phenomenon that has been noted previously in some critically ill patients. (See ""Fever in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Outcomes'.) Further details on the risk factors associated with severe disease are provided separately. (See 'Risk factors for progression' above.)Long term sequelae — The percentage of patients that require long term care is unreported. Similarly, the incidence of critical care neuromyopathy is not yet documented. In our experience the rate may be higher than usual due to the prolonged nature of intubation in COVID-19 patients and higher use of neuromuscular blockade and sedatives, with or without concurrent glucocorticoid administration. (See ""Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness"".)The incidence of post-intensive care unit syndrome (PICS) is also unknown in COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, patients should be followed and treated for PICS which involves nutritional, physical, psychological, and occupational therapy. (See ""Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)"".)END OF LIFE ISSUES — In a public health emergency, values other than autonomy predominate. Like any critical illness, severe illness due to COVID-19 carries the potential of significant psychosocial distress to patients, families, and surrogates. In addition, unique aspects of COVID-19 and its management portend greater trauma including anxiety and stigma surrounding a novel pathogen and high-level isolation precautions including visitation limitation or prohibition including at the end of life. High levels of patient, family, and surrogate psychosocial distress should be anticipated and combatted with clear communication strategies and early palliative care involvement. Even if in-person visitation is not allowed due to public health care concerns, hospitals should promote internet based visual communication such as video communication between clinicians, families, and isolated patients.   Discussing end-of-life wishes with patients and their family should occur early in the course of management, including potentially even before diagnosis, especially in light of the poor outcomes for elderly patients with comorbidities who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require mechanical ventilation. Consultation with the palliative care teams and ethic experts should also be done to assist families in decision-making and assist clinicians with contentious issues or disagreement that may arise. Due to the unique aspects to addressing needs of patient and families in this pandemic, several online resources are available for clinicians to use when having COVID-19 specific discussions with patients and families. They provide helpful language and strategies for conversations about a range of issues including, but not limited to, triaging, discussing goals of care, resource allocation, and grieving including:●VIITALtalk ●Center to Advance Palliative Care ●National Coalition for Hospice an Palliative Care Further principles regarding ethical issues in the intensive care unit (ICU) and advance care planning are discussed separately. (See ""Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults"" and ""Ethics in the intensive care unit: Informed consent"" and ""Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit"" and ""Communication in the ICU: Holding a family meeting"" and ""Palliative care: Issues in the intensive care unit in adults"" and ""Advance care planning and advance directives"", section on 'COVID-19 resources'.)DISCHARGE AND LONG TERM CARE — For patients who extubate successfully and can be safely discharged home, routine community precautions apply. For patients who require a tracheostomy or are deconditioned from critical illness, transfer to a long term acute care (LTAC) facility is typical. However, there is no guidance on whether or when patients should be re-tested. Many, but not all, LTACs require two negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests performed 24 hours apart before accepting a patient with COVID-19. If positive testing delays transfer to an LTAC, continued infection control precautions are advised, and rehab and weaning should begin at the acute care facility. Discontinuation of infection control precautions is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.) Outcomes in patients who require long term care are unknown. Treatment of patients who require admission to an LTAC should be similar to non-COVID patients. Particular attention should be paid to continuing venous thromboembolism prophylaxis until the acute illness fully resolves or the patient become mobile, although the efficacy of this approach is unknown. Duration of therapeutic anticoagulation should be guided by the indication; for example, a minimum of three months for documented or presumed VTE is appropriate while shorter durations are reasonable for device thrombosis. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".) The management of patients who require long term mechanical ventilation is discussed separately. (See ""Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation"".)SURGE CAPACITY AND SCARCE RESOURCE ALLOCATION — COVID-19 is a global pandemic and has placed significant increases in demand for acute and critical care services on hospitals in many regions. This has necessitated operations maneuvers to increase capacity to be able to provide care for more patients, for higher acuity patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation, and for patients with special isolation requirements. Surge capacity may be achieved by maximizing resources across three domains: ●Care spaces (ie, beds)●Staff●Physical equipmentIn the COVID-19 pandemic, this has included expanding ICU care into non-ICU spaces, utilizing non-critical care trained staff to participate in delivering critical care, and innovative approaches to obtain, conserve, and increase the efficiency of physical equipment including personal protective equipment (PPE; eg, repeat use of N95 masks) and mechanical ventilators (eg, double ventilation, repurposing operating room ventilators). As an example, some experts have published preliminary data to highlight the use of one ventilator for use in multiple patients [89]. However, this maneuver was designed for a disaster setting where one might reasonably expect that several patients might need life support at similar levels. Use of this measure as a life-saving measure in patients with COVID-19 could be complicated if patients are not matched well in terms of their ventilator settings. Potential use of anesthesia ventilators for longer-term mechanical ventilation is provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines"".)In some instances, such as in Italy, despite mobilizing to surge capacity, demand for care has still outpaced supply such that overt rationing has occurred [90]. All hospitals facing the potential of an acute surge event due to COVID-19 or another insult should have a process to approach the allocation of scarce resources such as ICU beds and mechanical ventilators [91,92]. Most individual states in the United States have guidance documents which can be adapted for local institutions [91]. General principles that guide and underpin scarce resource allocation policies include: ●Maximization of lives saved and/or life-years saved●Transparency ●Stakeholder and public input●Separation between the clinical team and the triage process (eg, ethics committees for difficult triage decisions)●Robust palliative care and supportive measures for patients who are not provided with critical care resourcesSOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), up to one-quarter require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. (See 'Introduction' above and 'Epidemiology' above.)●Profound hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the dominant finding in critically ill patients. Common complications include acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated liver enzymes, and the late development of cardiac injury, including sudden cardiac death. Sepsis, shock, and multi-organ failure are less common. (See 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' above.) ●For most critically ill patients with COVID-19, we prefer the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting a peripheral oxygen saturation between 90 and 96 percent. (See 'Respiratory care of the nonintubated patient' above and 'Oxygenation targets' above and 'Low flow oxygen' above.)•The use of high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is controversial based on infection control concerns and the frequent need for mechanical ventilation despite these measures. The decision to initiate noninvasive modalities requires balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of resources; this approach should be reassessed as new data becomes available. (See 'Patients with higher oxygen requirements' above.) •In patients with COVID-19 who have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and higher oxygen needs than low flow oxygen can provide, we suggest selective use of noninvasive measures rather than routinely proceeding directly to intubation (Grade 2C). As an example we might trial HFNC in younger patients without comorbidities who can tolerate nasal cannulae. In contrast, we may proceed directly to early intubation in patients at higher risk (eg, elderly patients and patients with comorbidities or risk factors for progression). •Among the noninvasive modalities we suggest HFNC rather than NIV (Grade 2C). Our preference for HFNC is based upon limited and inconsistent data, which, on balance, favors HFNC compared with NIV in HFNC in patients with non-COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. NIV via a full face mask (with a good seal) may be appropriate in patients with indications that have proven efficacy including acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and sleep disordered breathing. (See ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure' and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'.).•For patients with COVID-19 who receive HFNC or NIV, vigilant monitoring is warranted for progression with frequent clinical and arterial blood gas evaluation every one to two hours to ensure efficacy and safe ventilation. The threshold to intubate such patients should be low. Attempting prone positioning is also appropriate. ●For critically ill patients with COVID-19, intubation should not be delayed until the patient acutely decompensates since this is potentially harmful to both the patient and healthcare workers. We have a low threshold to intubate those who have (see 'Timing' above):•Rapid progression over a few hours•Failure to improve despite HFNC >40 L/min and FiO2 >0.6•Development of hypercapnia•Hemodynamic instability or multiorgan failure ●Intubation is a high risk procedure for aerosol dispersion in patients with COVID-19 and attention should be paid to donning full personal protective equipment (PPE) with airborne precautions (figure 2 and figure 3) as well using equipment that minimizes dispersion (eg, video laryngoscopy) and the development of protocols for the procedure (eg, check lists) (table 2 and figure 1). (See 'Precautions' above and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)●We use low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) (range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW (table 3 and table 4)) that targets a plateau pressure ≤30 cm H2O and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table (table 5). For patients with COVID-19 who fail LTVV, prone ventilation is the preferred next step (table 7 and table 6). (See 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome' above and ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".) ●Several procedures, including the collection of respiratory specimens, bronchoscopy, extubation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are aerosol-generating and should be avoided or minimized, if possible. All procedures should be grouped when possible. (See 'Interventions' above.)●Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are mechanically ventilated for ARDS should receive the usual daily surveillance, and supportive care including conservative fluid management (unless patients have sepsis or volume depletion) (table 1). Measurement of surveillance cardiac troponins and a low threshold to perform transthoracic echocardiography is appropriate for the early detection of cardiac injury. (See 'Supportive care' above and 'Monitoring for complications' above.) •In critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS who do not have a specific indication (eg, acute bronchospasm or refractory septic shock), we suggest not administering glucocorticoids (Grade 2C). The rationale for not administering glucocorticoids in this population is that the data supporting any benefit in the non-COVD-19 population did not include a sufficient proportion of patients with viral pneumonia to inform safety and that data in patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], influenza) suggested harm. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'.) •For acute bronchodilation, we prefer the use of in-line metered dose inhalers (MDIs) rather than administration via a standard jet or vibrating mesh nebulizer due to the lower risk of aerosolization associated with MDIs. Individual institutions should work with their pharmacy regarding compassionate use of investigational medications and trial enrollment. We suggest the development of protocols by individual ICUs for the off-label use of investigational agents. (See 'Nebulized medication' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)●For patients with COVID-19 who develop ARDS, the prognosis is poor with mortality ranging from 52 to 67 percent. The highest rates of death occur in those ≥64 years. (See 'Prognosis' above.)●A greater level of anxiety and trauma among patients and families should be anticipated and combatted with clear communication strategies and early palliative care involvement. Precautions should continue if the patient continues to test positive for COVID-19 before discharge to a long term acute care facility. (See 'End of life issues' above and 'Discharge and long term care' above.)●Several measures should be adopted to accommodate a surge in COVID-19 cases including included expanding ICU care into non-ICU spaces, utilizing non-critical care trained staff to participate in delivering critical care, and innovative approaches to obtain, conserve, and increase the efficiency of physical equipment (eg, personal protective equipment and mechanical ventilators).

Information about COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, and interim guidance by multiple organizations is constantly being updated and expanded. This topic will discuss issues related to COVID-19 during pregnancy and delivery.VIROLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY — General issues regarding the virology, geographic distribution, route of transmission, period of infectivity, and immunity of SARS-CoV-2 are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)Vertical transmission is addressed below. (See 'Vertical transmission' below.)PREVENTION — Pregnant women should follow the same recommendations as nonpregnant persons for avoiding exposure to the virus (eg, social distancing, hand hygiene, disinfecting surfaces, wearing a mask in public). Women with epidemiologic history of contact should be monitored. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Personal preventive measures'.)Pregnant women with children should exercise caution. COVID-19 in children is often mild and may be asymptomatic, although severe cases have been reported. Given the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or presymptomatic individuals within the incubation period) [1-7], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that children not have playdates with children from other households; that they remain ≥6 feet from people from other households when playing outside; and that they wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain [8]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Should play dates and playgrounds be avoided?'.) Pregnant health care workers have additional concerns, and there is no standard occupational guidance for them regarding work restrictions [9,10].Pregnant workers in occupations other than health care may continue to work until they deliver, but risk mitigation (reassignment at term to roles with reduced risk of exposure or self-quarantine) can be considered to reduce the individual's risk of being infected peripartum, when maternal infection has broader implications (eg, exposure of health care workers, infant exposure) [9]. The patient's comorbidities and individual work situation should guide the clinician's response to requests for medical leave.CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS — All pregnant women should be monitored for development of symptoms and signs of COVID-19, particularly if they have had close contact with a confirmed case or persons under investigation. In a systematic review including 356 cases in pregnant women (33 studies), the most frequent symptoms were fever (67 percent), cough (66 percent), dyspnea (7 percent), sore throat (7 percent), fatigue (7 percent), and myalgia (6 percent) [11]. Rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, headache, and possibly abnormalities in smell and/or taste have also been reported. Laboratory findings included lymphopenia (14 percent), modest increase in liver enzymes (5 percent), and thrombocytopenia (1 percent) [11]. These clinical manifestations are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)Complications of infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shock. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)Classification of disease severity — In the United States, the National Institutes of Health have categorized disease severity as [12]:●Asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection – Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 but no symptoms.●Mild illness – Any signs and symptoms (eg, fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain) without shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging.●Moderate illness – Evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) >93 percent on room air at sea level.●Severe illness – Respiratory frequency >30 breaths per minute, SaO2 ≤93 percent on room air at sea level, ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300, or lung infiltrates >50 percent.●Critical illness – Respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.Disease severity has also been categorized as (Wu classification) [13]:●Mild – No or mild symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough, and/or less common features of COVID-19).●Severe – Tachypnea (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute), hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤93 percent on room air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg), or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging).●Critical (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Defining disease severity'.)COURSE IN PREGNANCYMaternal course — Available data from multiple small series and case reports generally suggest that pregnancy and childbirth do not increase the risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, do not worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 compared with nonpregnant individuals of the same age, and most infected mothers recover without undergoing delivery [13-28]. The population most commonly affected by severe disease is older adults, particularly those with comorbidities, and most pregnant women are younger than middle age; however, they may have comorbid conditions that increase their risk (eg, obesity). It is known that some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response (similar to cytokine release syndrome), which has been associated with critical and fatal illnesses. Whether the normal immunologic changes of pregnancy affect the occurrence and course of this response is unknown. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications'.)In pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia, early data show approximately the same rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions as in the nonpregnant population but an increased risk of preterm and cesarean delivery. (See 'Pregnancy complications' below.)●In a systematic review including 295 pregnant patients, 4.7 percent were admitted to an ICU [27]. ●In an initial United States experience from New York City including 43 pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19, the disease course was mild in 37 (86 percent), severe in 4 (9.3 percent), and critical in 2 (4.7 percent) [14]. ●In a larger cohort of 147 pregnant patients in the WHO-China Joint Mission Report and a separate report of 118 pregnant patients in Wuhan, the illness was severe in 8 percent and critical in 1 percent [17]. These percentages are similar to those of nonpregnant, reproductive-age adults [13,29].Severe sequelae of maternal infection include prolonged ventilatory support and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [30,31].Several maternal deaths from cardiopulmonary complications, sometimes with multiorgan failure, have been reported in the medical literature [32-34]. Most of these women were generally healthy prior to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.It is important to note that in one report from New York City, 10 of 14 patients (71 percent) who were asymptomatic on admission for an obstetric indication and found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive on universal screening went on to develop symptoms during their delivery admission or postpartum [14]. Of the 14 initially asymptomatic patients, 4 remained asymptomatic, 8 developed mild symptoms, and 2 developed severe/critical disease.While the course of the infection in pregnant persons is similar to that in nonpregnant persons, there are added issues during pregnancy, such as timing of prenatal care visits and screening tests in uninfected women and, in infected women, potential pregnancy complications, timing and management of labor and delivery, and postpartum care (mother-newborn separation, breastfeeding, infant care, postpartum depression risk). These issues are reviewed below.Pregnancy complications — Preterm birth and cesarean delivery rates are increased. A systematic review including 252 pregnant COVID-19 patients reported that 15 percent delivered before 37 weeks and 70 percent were delivered by cesarean [11]. It is important to emphasize that available data are generally of low quality, reflecting small numbers of cases and a disproportionate number of patients intubated with COVID-19 pneumonia. Fever and hypoxemia from severe pneumonia may increase the risks for preterm labor, prelabor rupture of membranes, and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, but preterm deliveries also occurred in patients without severe respiratory disease. It appears that many of the initial third-trimester cases were electively delivered by cesarean because of a bias to intervene catalyzed by the belief that management of severe maternal respiratory disease would be improved by delivery; however, this hypothesis is unproven.The frequency of spontaneous abortion does not appear to be increased, but data on first-trimester infections are limited [11,27,35]. At least five critically ill women had fetal deaths: four of these women died, and the other was on ECMO [30,32,33]. Over 95 percent of newborns have been in good condition at birth; neonatal complications have largely been related to preterm birth and to adverse uterine environments resulting from critical maternal disease [11,33,36].Hyperthermia, which is common in COVID-19, is a theoretical concern as elevation of maternal core temperature from a febrile illness during organogenesis in the first trimester may be associated with an increased risk of congenital anomalies, especially neural tube defects, or miscarriage; however, an increased incidence of these outcomes has not been observed. Use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, including in the first trimester, has been shown overall to be safe and may attenuate the pregnancy risks associated with fever exposure. (See ""Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management"", section on 'Fever/hyperthermia'.)Vertical transmission — Vertical transmission had not been proven, but the possibility of transmission cannot be excluded. Standards for neonatal evaluation at delivery of an infected mother and criteria for vertical transmission have not been developed. Assessing the immunoglobulin M (IgM) level for the virus in cord blood and sampling the neonatal nasopharynx, amnion-chorion interface, and placental tissue using aseptic technique immediately after delivery have been suggested. Amniotic fluid obtained at cesarean delivery could also be tested.In women who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx, vaginal and amniotic fluid specimens have been negative to date [35,37,38]. Viremia rates in patients with COVID-19 appear to be low (1 percent in one study [39]) and transient, suggesting placental seeding and vertical transmission are unlikely. Few placentas have been studied, and almost all had no evidence of infection. One exception is a case report of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 who had second-trimester miscarriage in which samples taken from a placental cotyledon and submembrane were positive for SARS-CoV-2; all fetal, amniotic fluid, cord blood, and maternal blood and vaginal samples were negative [40]. Another report described one positive placental swab from the amniotic surface and two positive membrane swabs from between the amnion and chorion after manual separation of the membranes in women with severe or critical COVID-19 illness delivered by cesarean; none of the infants were positive for SARS-CoV-2 [41].The extent and clinical significance of vertical transmission remain unclear. A few possible cases of vertical transmission based on newborn laboratory and/or clinical findings have been reported [20,42-45], but SARS-CoV-2 testing on fetal blood, amniotic fluid, and placenta was either negative or not performed. Many of these infants were delivered by cesarean and had positive nasopharyngeal cultures for SARS-CoV-2 on days 1 or 2 of life, an elevated IgM level, and/or pneumonia. Positive IgM results are not definitive evidence of in utero infection (false positives and cross reactivity occur), and, in many of these cases, early infant infection may have been due to postnatal contact with infected parents or caregivers [46].APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS — The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered in patients with new-onset fever/chills and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea). It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Residing in or travel to a location where there is community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the past 14 days should heighten suspicion. Patients who meet the testing criteria should undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen, ideally in addition to testing for other respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus). Criteria for testing and diagnostic issues are discussed in detail separately (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'). In areas where the infection is active, we believe testing all patients upon presentation to labor and delivery (or the day before if a scheduled admission) with a rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 is reasonable, if testing is available. (See 'Infection control precautions' below.) This testing should occur in a location designed to reduce the risk of passing the infection to uninfected persons, such as at dedicated ""walk-in"" or ""drive-in"" testing locations from which results can be made readily available to the obstetric providers. A positive RT-PCR generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although occasional false-positive tests occur [47]. False-negative tests on initial testing appear to be common, especially in the four days preceding symptoms and the first day of symptoms [48], and have been reported in pregnant women [49]. Sensitivity depends on several factors: the specific RT-PCR assay, the type of specimen obtained (nasopharyngeal specimens have higher sensitivity than oropharyngeal or nasal specimens), the quality of the specimen, and the duration of illness at the time of testing [47]. If the initial nasopharyngeal test is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, the test should be repeated in 24 hours to a few days. Infection control precautions for COVID-19 should continue while repeat evaluation is being performed. Two subsequent negative samples generally rule out the infection [50]. If there is high suspicion of COVID-19 infection and diagnosis is required for management, lower respiratory tract specimens (eg, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) can be tested as they have higher sensitivity [51]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings'.)A chest radiograph is sufficient for initial evaluation of pulmonary complications in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A single chest radiograph carries a very low fetal radiation dose of 0.0005 to 0.01 mGy. Computed tomography (CT) should be performed, if indicated, as the fetal radiation dose for a routine chest CT (table 1) is also low and not associated with an increased risk of fetal anomalies or pregnancy loss. Some authorities have advocated pulmonary ultrasound, possibly at the same time as the obstetric scan, for quick diagnosis of pneumonia in pregnant women, which in certain locations would be the quickest way to ascertain high suspicion of maternal COVID-19 infection [52,53]. A detailed description of performance of lung ultrasound can be found elsewhere [52]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Evaluation' and ""Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and nursing women"".)PRENATAL CAREPreventing exposure in the community — Social distancing and hygienic measures are recommended but may be difficult for pregnant women who are homeless, living in a shelter, living in multigenerational dense housing, or living in multiple places in a short time. Social distancing and hygienic measures are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Personal preventive measures'.)Patients with potential exposure — Pregnant patients with an epidemiologic history of contact with a person with confirmed, probable, or suspected COVID-19 should self-isolate and be monitored for symptoms. The incubation period is up to 14 days. Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on test availability. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Managing asymptomatic individuals with potential exposure'.)Further evaluation and management of patients who become symptomatic depend on illness severity, underlying comorbidities, and clinical status. Those with at least moderate illness are typically hospitalized. These issues and timing of discontinuation of precautions are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Routine prenatal care in uninfected women — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine have issued guidance regarding prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic (available at acog.org and SMFM.org) [54,55]. It includes general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19, algorithms, and suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits. These modifications, which should be tailored for low- versus high-risk patients (eg, multiple gestation, hypertension, diabetes), include telehealth, reducing the number of in-person visits, timing of visits, grouping tests (eg, aneuploidy, diabetes, infection screening) to minimize maternal contact with others, restricting visitors during visits and tests, timing of indicated obstetric ultrasound examinations (eg, gestational age, fetal anomaly, fetal growth, placental attachment), and timing and frequency of use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles. There are many ways to reduce the time patients, including patients with high-risk pregnancies, are in the office [56]. For example, the clinician can order a 75 gram two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) instead of a glucose challenge test and 100 gram three-hour GTT (in women with positive results); cell-free DNA screening can be used (at >10 weeks) for Down syndrome screening rather than the combined test (ie, nuchal translucency on ultrasound and serum analytes). Ideally, every woman should have telehealth capabilities and a means for measuring blood pressure at home. In the author's practice, during the pandemic, most low-risk pregnant women come to the office only for in-person prenatal visits at approximately 12, 20, 28, and 36 weeks of gestation (ie, at gestational ages when ultrasound and/or laboratory tests can also be performed) to minimize person-to-person contacts. Some practices are encouraging that even these visits occur by telehealth, and others include a visit at approximately 32 weeks [50]. When an outpatient office visit occurs, all patients and health care workers wear at least a surgical mask; no partner is allowed, but video communication is encouraged.The psychological impact of COVID-19 should also be recognized and support offered. In one study, approximately one-third of respondents reported moderate to severe anxiety [57].Medical management of pregnant women with COVID-19Home care — Most pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19 have mild disease (no shortness of breath) that does not warrant hospital-level care in the absence of obstetric problems (eg, preterm labor). Patient instructions and other aspects of home care are similar to that in nonpregnant persons, except pregnant women in the third trimester should perform fetal kick counts and report decreased fetal movement [50]. Patients experiencing homelessness should be provided resources such as dedicated housing units, where available. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting' and ""Decreased fetal movement: Diagnosis, evaluation, and management"".) The US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its approval for use of noninvasive fetal and maternal monitoring devices in the home in patients who require fetal and/or maternal monitoring for conditions unrelated to COVID-19 [58]. This can help reduce patient and health care provider contact and potential exposure to COVID-19 during the pandemic.Medical and obstetric care of hospitalized patients — Pregnant women with mild disease plus comorbidities or moderate to critical disease are hospitalized. Pregnant hospitalized patients with severe disease, an oxygen requirement plus comorbidities, or critical disease should be cared for by a multispecialty team at a level III or IV hospital with obstetric services and an adult intensive care unit (ICU) [9,50]. COVID-19 status alone is not necessarily a reason to transfer noncritically ill pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. (See 'Classification of disease severity' above.)Guidelines for management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, including evaluation and care of critically ill patients, are reviewed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Fetal monitoring — A specific management issue in pregnant patients is fetal monitoring in those who are at a viable gestational age. The need for and frequency of fetal testing depend upon gestational age, stability of maternal vital signs, other maternal comorbidities, and discussions with the patient and her family that consider the possibly increased risks of stillbirth and perinatal morbidities in the absence of testing. For hospitalized patients, a Bluetooth-enabled external fetal monitor can transmit the fetal heart rate tracing to the obstetric provider. The monitor can be used continuously in unstable hospitalized patients in whom emergency cesarean delivery would be performed for a persistent nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. An abnormal tracing might also help guide maternal oxygen therapy. In patients with stable oxygen saturation (SaO2), a nonstress test can be performed once or twice daily, as one option. Monitoring for preterm labor — Monitoring pregnant patients for signs and symptoms of preterm labor is a routine component of obstetric care and should be a component of maternal monitoring of pregnant patients hospitalized in nonobstetric settings. (See ""Preterm labor: Clinical findings, diagnostic evaluation, and initial treatment"".)Maternal oxygenation level — Among critically ill COVID-19 patients, profound acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the dominant finding. General supportive care of the critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is similar to that in patients with ARDS due to other causes. Common complications of COVID-19-related ARDS include acute kidney injury, elevated liver enzymes, and cardiac injury (eg, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death). During pregnancy, maternal peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) should be maintained at ≥95 percent, which is in excess of the oxygen delivery needs of the mother. If SpO2 falls below 95 percent, an arterial blood gas is obtained to measure the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): Maternal PaO2 greater than 70 mmHg is desirable to maintain a favorable oxygen diffusion gradient from the maternal to the fetal side of the placenta.In the ICU, severely ill patients with COVID-19 are often managed in the prone position. Some ICUs have extended this approach to pregnant women, although even a semi-prone position can be a difficult position in which to place a pregnant woman in the last half of pregnancy. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"" and ""Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period"", section on 'Supportive care' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)Use and type of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis — Direct data on thromboembolic risk with COVID-19 are limited but suggest an increased risk. The American Society of Hematology, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, and the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis [59-61] recommend routine pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 unless there is a contraindication (eg, bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia). We initiate prophylaxis in all pregnant/postpartum women with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital for management of an antepartum or postpartum obstetric or medical disorder or because of the severity of COVID-19 alone. For antepartum prophylaxis in women who are not severely or critically ill and who may deliver within a few days, unfractionated heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 12 hours is a reasonable dose. Dosing in other inpatient clinical scenarios is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and 'Postpartum care' below.)Unfractionated heparin is generally preferred in pregnant women who might be proximate to delivery because it is more readily reversed than low molecular weight heparin. Low molecular weight heparin is reasonable in women unlikely to be delivered within several days and those who are postpartum. Dosing is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)Safety of antiviral drug therapy — Several agents are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Although some of these agents are clinically available for other indications, their use for COVID-19 remains investigational. ●Remdesivir – At some hospitals, pregnant women with severe COVID-19 are being offered remdesivir in a compassionate-use protocol. Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [62] and related coronaviruses (including severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) both in vitro and in animal studies [63]. It has been used without reported fetal toxicity in some pregnant women with Ebola and Marburg virus disease [64] and is being used to treat, on a compassionate-use basis, pregnant patients with severe COVID-19. Randomized trials of the drug during the COVID-19 pandemic have excluded pregnant and breastfeeding women. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)●Other drugs – Data from early randomized trials generally suggest no benefit from administration of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Furthermore, adverse maternal effects include abnormal heart rhythms (QT interval prolongation and ventricular tachycardia), especially in patients taking other drugs associated with QTc prolongation. Therefore, these drugs should not be used for treatment of COVID-19 outside of ongoing randomized trials. Hydroxychloroquine crosses the placenta. Accumulation in fetal ocular tissue has been observed in animal studies, but an increased risk of fetal ocular abnormalities has not been observed in humans, which is reassuring given that the drug has been used by pregnant women for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus or for prevention of malaria. Available data are limited, however, and a risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out when used at different doses for other indications [65]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' and ""Malaria in pregnancy: Prevention and treatment"", section on 'Safety of antimalarials in pregnancy' and ""Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus"", section on 'Medications'.)Several other drugs are being used in research studies. One such drug is lopinavir-ritonavir, which is primarily used for treatment of HIV infection, including during pregnancy. It crosses the placenta and may increase the risk for preterm delivery, but an increased risk of teratogenic effects has not been observed in humans. Investigational drugs for COVID-19 that are known to be teratogenic include ribavirin and baricitinib. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications●Antenatal betamethasone – For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because they have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with MERS-CoV infection. However, the CDC has not addressed use of antenatal glucocorticoids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from preterm birth in pregnant COVID-19-positive patients.Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at high risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 [66]. However, for pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation and at risk of preterm birth within seven days, the benefits to the neonate are less clear, and ACOG has advised not administering a course of betamethasone to such patients. However, these decisions may need to be individualized, weighing the neonatal benefits with the risks of potential harm to the pregnant patient. (See ""Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery"", section on 'Gestational age at administration'.)●Low-dose aspirin – For pregnant women without COVID-19, ACOG has stated that low-dose aspirin should continue to be offered as medically indicated (eg, prevention of preeclampsia) [67]. For those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for whom low-dose aspirin would be indicated, the decision to continue the drug should be individualized. For example, continuing preeclampsia prophylaxis is likely not worthwhile in severely or critically ill patients or near term. A panel from the National Institutes of Health has stated that persons with COVID-19 who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for a comorbid condition should continue therapy as previously directed by their health care provider [12].Concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [68,69]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients when clinically indicated [70,71]. ●Tocolysis – In women with known or suspected COVID-19, our preferred tocolytic is nifedipine. It is a suitable alterative to indomethacin, which is subject to the concerns discussed above, and to beta sympathomimetics, which can further increase the maternal heart rate. Follow-up of women who recover from COVID-19 — Development of fetal growth restriction is a theoretic concern and has been described with other SARS infections [72,73]. In the absence of robust data, authorities have suggested that pregnant women with confirmed infection should be monitored with serial ultrasound assessments of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume [74] beginning 14 days after symptom resolution [75]. For those with first- or early second-trimester infection, a detailed fetal morphology scan at 18 to 23 weeks of gestation is also indicated. Very limited COVID-19-specific data on fetal growth are available [18]. Suboptimal fetal growth due to placental insufficiency is plausible because maternal COVID-19 has been associated with focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels in the chorionic plate and stem villi [76]. These lesions could be caused by COVID-19-related coagulopathy or placental hypoxia during the acute maternal illness, or both. Timing delivery in infected women — For most women with preterm COVID-19 and nonsevere illness who have no medical/obstetric indications for prompt delivery, delivery is not indicated and ideally will occur sometime after a negative testing result is obtained or isolation status is lifted, thereby minimizing the risk of postnatal transmission to the neonate [77].In women with severe illness, there are multiple issues to consider, and timing of delivery needs to be individualized [50,78]. Whether the mother's respiratory disease will be improved by delivery and the risk of postnatal transmission in the delivery room when maternal symptoms are acute are both unclear. It should also be noted that maternal antibody production and, in turn, passive newborn immunity may not have had time to develop. On the other hand, increased oxygen consumption and reduced functional residual capacity, which are normal in pregnancy, may facilitate maternal deterioration in patients with pneumonia [79]. Excessive uterine distension from multiple gestation or severe polyhydramnios in the third trimester may further compromise pulmonary function.For the hospitalized patient with COVID-19 with pneumonia but not intubated, some authorities have advocated consideration of delivery in pregnancies >32 to 34 weeks. The rationale is that delivery is performed before the pulmonary situation worsens and ongoing maternal hypoxemia places the fetus at risk of compromise. Most authorities do not advocate delivery prior to 32 weeks, even though the maternal situation may worsen in the second week, given the known morbidity and mortality of very preterm infants.Timing of delivery of the hospitalized pregnant woman intubated and critically ill with COVID-19 is challenging. After 32 to 34 weeks, some have advocated delivery if the patient is stable, but this could exacerbate the maternal condition. Between viability and <32 weeks, continuing maternal support with fetal monitoring is usually suggested for perinatal benefit as long as the maternal situation remains stable or improving. In some situations, maternal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be necessary [80]. MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND DELIVERY — Although many asymptomatic patients are concerned about leaving their home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) continues to recommend following existing evidence-based guidance regarding home birth [67]. (See ""Planned home birth"".)Infection control precautions●Prehospital notification of possible infection – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that pregnant patients who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 notify the obstetric unit before arrival so that the facility can make appropriate infection control preparations [81]. The obstetric unit should ensure that their infection control practices for these patients are consistent with CDC guidelines. ●Evaluation of all patients presenting to the hospital – All patients should be screened for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as whether they have had close contact with a confirmed case or persons under investigation, before entering the hospital for admission to the labor and delivery unit [82]. Screening can include checking temperature and asking about fever and/or new cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle aches, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, and smell and taste abnormalities. The CDC advises prioritizing the testing of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 at admission or who develop symptoms of COVID-19 during admission [81]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)Asymptomatic patients and presymptomatic patients may present to the labor and delivery unit, which has implications for the health care staff and management of the newborn. For this reason, in areas where infection in the community is widespread, we believe testing all patients upon presentation to labor and delivery (or the day before if a scheduled admission) with a rapid SARS-CoV-2 test is reasonable, if testing is available. We believe this information is useful to inform infection control precautions both intrapartum and postpartum, including newborn care [14,83,84]. During the New York City pandemic, 215 pregnant women admitted to two New York City hospitals for delivery were screened for COVID-19, and 33 (15 percent) were SARS-CoV-2-positive [21]. Of the 33 women, 4 were symptomatic and 29 were asymptomatic; thus, 13.5 percent of asymptomatic patients admitted for delivery tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the asymptomatic women who tested positive, 3/29 developed a postpartum fever, and at least one of these patients was presumed to have COVID-19. One additional patient who tested negative on admission became symptomatic postpartum, and repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing was positive. However, these findings are likely not generalizable to areas where the prevalence of COVID-19 is low.The evaluation and diagnosis of women admitted to labor and delivery with suspected COVID-19 are similar to that of other patients admitted to the hospital with suspected disease. The CDC advises prioritizing the testing of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 at admission or who develop symptoms of COVID-19 during admission [81]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)●Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) on labor and delivery – Health care workers should use appropriate PPE when caring for patients with COVID-19. In addition, all patients and any visitors should be given face coverings upon entry into the health care setting (medical or cloth masks) for universal source control. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)During active labor, in particular, there are concerns of viral dissemination when the patient is forcefully exhaling [85]. Forceful exhalation may reduce the effectiveness of a mask for containing respiratory droplets and preventing the spread of the virus. ●Care of COVID-19-positive inpatients – Ideally, pregnant COVID-19 inpatients should be cared for in specially equipped (eg, negative-pressure) rooms in antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum COVID-19-only units, similar to other adult COVID-19 inpatients who are usually placed in dedicated COVID-19-only units, halls, or hospitals. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are normally instructed to wear a face mask, including during labor and delivery, which may be difficult during active pushing [85]. Infection control precautions regarding pregnant patients with confirmed or suspected infection are similar to those for other hospitalized patients and are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●Support persons on labor and delivery – Perhaps the most controversial issue regarding infection control for women in labor and delivery units is whether to allow a support person. Most facilities recognize that a support person is important to many laboring women and permit one support person who must remain with the laboring woman (may not leave her room and then return). A doula is considered a type of health care personnel by some facilities and a visitor by others. (See ""Continuous labor support by a doula"".)The support person should be screened for fever and other symptoms before entering the building and in accordance with hospital policies. Those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. If screening is negative, we require that the support person wear a cloth face covering, at a minimum, consistent with CDC guidance [82]. If the support person arrives at the health care facility without a cloth face covering, a face mask should be issued if supplies are available.A support person who screens positive should not be permitted in the hospital. In such cases and when additional support persons are desired, they can be a part of the patient's labor and delivery via video. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)Route of delivery — COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery [16,54]. Cesarean delivery is performed for standard obstetric indications. Even if vertical transmission is confirmed as additional data are reported, this would not be an indication for cesarean delivery since it would increase maternal risk and would be unlikely to improve newborn outcome. Reports of COVID-19 infection in the neonate have generally described mild disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)Screening patients scheduled for induction or cesarean delivery — Patients should be screened for COVID-19 and can undergo pre-induction/pre-cesarean laboratory testing the day before a planned induction or cesarean delivery. We evaluate symptomatic patients to determine whether it is feasible to reschedule until results of COVID-19 testing are available. This requires balancing the risks of continuing the pregnancy in the setting of a positive or negative test result. In particular, if the result is positive, the patient may become more severely ill over time since symptoms are often more severe in the second week of the illness.In asymptomatic women, inductions of labor and cesarean deliveries with appropriate medical indications should not be postponed or rescheduled; this includes 39-week inductions or cesarean deliveries after patient counseling. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications'.)Analgesia and anesthesia — In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, neuraxial anesthetic is not contraindicated and has several advantages in laboring patients: it provides good analgesia and thus reduces cardiopulmonary stress from pain and anxiety and, in turn, the chance of viral dissemination, and it is available in case an emergency cesarean is required, thus obviating the need for general anesthesia. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology suggests considering suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in these patients because of insufficient data about cleaning, filtering, and potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems [86]. They also urge consideration of limiting use of intravenous, patient-controlled analgesia because of the risk of respiratory depression. General anesthesia (intubation and extubation) is considered an aerosolizing procedure, so special PPE (ie, N-95 masks, etc) should be worn by all involved health care providers during such a cesarean delivery. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)Magnesium sulfate — In women with respiratory compromise, the use of magnesium sulfate for maternal seizure prophylaxis and/or neonatal neuroprotection should be decided on a case-by-case basis since the drug may further depress respirations. Consultation with maternal-fetal medicine and pulmonary/critical care specialists is advised.Labor management — Generally, management of labor is not altered in women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic or in women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 that is asymptomatic or mild [85]. Person-to-person contact and time in the labor unit and hospital should be limited, as safely feasible. For patients who require cervical ripening, outpatient mechanical ripening with a balloon catheter is an option. For inpatient cervical ripening, using two methods (eg, mechanical and misoprostol or mechanical and oxytocin) decreases the time from induction to delivery, compared with using one agent only. (See ""Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction"", section on 'Outpatient cervical ripening' and ""Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction"", section on 'Balloon catheter combined with prostaglandins'.)Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended in women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; an increased frequency of nonreassuring tracings has been reported, but these case series typically had a high proportion of women with pneumonia. Intake and output of fluids should be carefully monitored in these women, and aggressive hydration should be avoided since it can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen maternal oxygenation that may already be compromised [79]. In nonpregnant patients with severe COVID-19, conservative fluid management is recommended, as long as hypotension and organ hypoperfusion can be avoided. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Fluid management'.)SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in vaginal secretions or amniotic fluid, so rupture of fetal membranes and internal fetal heart rate monitoring may be performed for usual indications, but data are limited [19]. It should be noted that labor, and particularly pushing, often causes loss of feces, which can contain the virus and spread the infection [39,87].We believe that use of interventions that can increase risk of infection and have not been proven beneficial, for example the use of the birth ball or peanut ball, should be limited. As intrapartum oxygen has no proven fetal benefit, the practice of oxygen therapy for fetal resuscitation should be abandoned; the nasal cannula and face mask used are in contact with the maternal respiratory tract and secretions, so handling of such equipment increases contamination/exposure between patient and provider. Lastly, we advocate not delaying pushing in the second stage, although others have suggested minimizing the duration of active pushing because deep breathing and maternal expulsive efforts may increase exposure to the patient's respiratory secretions [79]. (See ""Intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings: Management"", section on 'In utero resuscitation' and ""Nonpharmacologic approaches to management of labor pain"", section on 'Birth ball' and ""Management of normal labor and delivery"", section on 'Pushing position and technique'.)Delivery procedures — For women with known or suspected infection, ACOG has stated that delayed umbilical cord clamping is highly unlikely to increase the risk of transmitting pathogens from an infected mother to the fetus [54]; however, some institutions have chosen to prohibit this practice in term infants, in whom the benefits are modest, to minimize newborn exposure to any virus in the immediate environment and reduce the chances that the newborn will require phototherapy for jaundice. Some institutions also prohibit skin-to-skin contact in these cases [88], although the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics has not advised against this [16,89]. One expert group suggested leaving the vernix caseosa in place for 24 hours after birth since it contains antimicrobial peptides [90], whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics advised bathing newborns as soon as reasonably possible after birth to remove virus potentially present on skin surfaces [91].Umbilical cord blood banking can be performed if planned; the risk of COVID-19 transmission by blood products has not been documented and is unclear at present [54].Procedures for testing for vertical transmission are described above. (See 'Vertical transmission' above.)Intrapartum and postpartum fever — COVID-19 infection should be part of the differential diagnosis of intrapartum and postpartum fever, particularly when accompanied by respiratory symptoms and reduced oxygenation. Such patients should be tested for the virus, along with evaluation for common causes of intrapartum and postpartum infection (eg, chorioamnionitis, endometritis) [14]. (See ""Intrapartum fever"" and ""Postpartum endometritis"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)POSTPARTUM CAREVenous thromboembolism prophylaxis — Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be considered in postpartum women with COVID-19, with the decision based on individual risk assessment. There is wide variation in practice. For patients who did not receive antepartum pharmacologic prophylaxis because of COVID-19, we would not administer postpartum prophylaxis if they remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and have an uncomplicated delivery, with no standard indications for postpartum VTE prophylaxis. For patients who received antepartum prophylaxis because of COVID-19, some authorities recommend discontinuing prophylaxis upon discharge in the absence of ongoing risk factors for VTE (eg, immobilization, recent surgery), whereas others continue prophylaxis for 7 to 14 days (and up to six weeks) in patients who had moderate/severe/critical disease or in those with mild disease and other VTE risk factors [50,79,92]. These issues are discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)Maternal monitoring●For patients with known or suspected COVID-19 who are asymptomatic, postpartum maternal monitoring is routine. ●For patients with mild illness (see 'Classification of disease severity' above), we check vital signs and monitor intake and output every 4 hours for 24 hours after vaginal delivery and 48 hours after cesarean delivery. ●For patients with moderate illness, we perform continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for the first 24 hours or until improvement in signs and symptoms, whichever takes longer. The type and frequency of follow-up laboratory studies and chest imaging (initial or repeat) are guided by the patient's course. Several institutional protocols are available. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)●For patients with severe or critical illness, very close maternal monitoring and care on the labor and delivery unit or intensive care unit are indicated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Infant evaluation — The infants of mothers with COVID-19 are considered COVID-19 suspects, and they should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 [81]. Where testing capacity is available, neonates should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as possible and within the first 24 hours of age using available molecular assays [91]. Repeat testing should be performed at approximately 48 hours of age if the infant is still at the birth facility. Both the throat and nasopharynx should be sampled, but one swab may be used to conserve swabs and polymerase chain reaction testing reagents. A separate rectal swab can be obtained if such testing is available at their center. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)Mother-baby contact — Temporary separation of mothers with known or suspected COVID-19 from their newborns has been proposed to reduce the risk of mother-baby transmission, but may also have adverse consequences [93]. For example, not rooming-in and avoiding skin-to-skin contact can be stressful for mothers; disrupt breastfeeding; and have negative effects on newborn stress, feeding, and bonding.The World Health Organization (WHO) has opined that mothers who have suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 virus infection should be enabled to remain together and practice skin-to-skin contact [16]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise determining whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant on a case-by-case basis, using shared decision making between the mother and the clinical team [81]. Factors to consider include:●The mother's and infant's clinical conditions.●Whether the mother's infection is suspected (no SARS-CoV-2 test result) or confirmed, and the infant's SARS-CoV-2 testing result (separation is not necessary if the infant has a positive test).●The mother's desire to breastfeed.●The facility's ability to accommodate mother-baby separation or colocation.●The mother's ability to maintain separation when she goes home, if she has not met criteria to discontinue temporary separation.●Other risks and benefits of temporary separation of a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant.If mother-baby separation is implemented, the following should be considered:●Infant COVID-19 suspects should be isolated from other healthy infants and cared for according to the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.●If another healthy family member is providing infant care (eg, diapering, bathing, feeding), they should use appropriate personal protective equipment (healthy family members should wear a gown, gloves, face mask, and eye protection).If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, other measures may be utilized to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission and include:●Physical barriers (eg, a curtain between the mother and newborn) can be constructed, and the newborn can be kept in a temperature controlled isolette ≥6 feet away from the mother.●The mother can wear a face mask and practice hand hygiene when in close contact with her infant, particularly when feeding.●If another healthy adult is in the room, they can care for the newborn.After hospital discharge — After hospital discharge [91,94]:●A mother with symptomatic COVID-19 infection should maintain a distance of at least six feet from the newborn and use a face mask and hand hygiene for newborn care until (1) at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications plus improvement in respiratory symptoms [cough, shortness of breath]) and (2) at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.●For mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have never been symptomatic, transmission precautions can be discontinued when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test.These are symptom- and time-based strategies for discontinuing transmission precautions. Test-based strategies also exist and are discussed in detail separately. A disadvantage of test-based strategies is that a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result reflects presence of viral RNA but does not necessarily mean that viable virus is present and can be transmitted [47]. Data regarding postinfection risk of transmission and personal immunity are limited [95]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk of transmission' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Breastfeeding and formula feeding — The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from ingestion of breast milk is unclear. Although several small series reported that all samples of breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 tested negative [11,96], other investigators subsequently reported identifying samples of breast milk positive for the virus [97,98]. More data are needed to assess any potential risk of viral transmission from ingesting breast milk.There is general consensus that breastfeeding should be encouraged because of its many maternal and infant benefits. In the setting of maternal COVID-19 infection, the infant may receive passive antibody protection from the virus since breast milk is a source of antibodies and other anti-infective factors. (See ""Infant benefits of breastfeeding"" and ""Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding"".)If mother and baby separation has been implemented, ideally, the infant is fed expressed breast milk by another healthy caregiver until the mother has recovered or has been proven uninfected, provided that the other caregiver is healthy and follows hygiene precautions [81]. Expressing breast milk is important to support establishment of the maternal milk supply.Before pumping, ideally with a dedicated breast pump, the mother should wear a mask and thoroughly clean her hands and breasts with soap and water and clean pump parts, bottles, and artificial nipples [99]. The CDC has issued guidance about cleaning breast pumps and breastfeeding. If possible, the pumping equipment should be thoroughly cleaned by a healthy person. If feeding by a healthy caregiver is not possible, mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or symptomatic mothers with suspected COVID-19 should take precautions to prevent transmission to the infant during breastfeeding (wear a mask, hand and breast hygiene, disinfect shared surfaces that the symptomatic mother has contacted). However, it should be noted that the value of precautions, such as cleansing the breast prior to breastfeeding/milk expression or disinfecting external surfaces of milk collection devices (eg, bottles, milk bags) for reducing potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2, has not been formally studied [100].Ideally, women who choose to formula feed should have another healthy caregiver feed the infant. If this is not possible or desired, such women must also take appropriate infection control precautions, as described above, to prevent transmission through close contact when feeding.Analgesia — Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for treatment of postpartum pain. As discussed above, concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs in patients with COVID-19 was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [68,69]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and WHO do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs when clinically indicated [70,71]. Given the uncertainty, we suggest using acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Permanent and reversible contraception — Permanent contraception (tubal sterilization) does not add significant additional time or risk when performed at an uncomplicated cesarean birth and thus should be performed if planned. Permanent contraception after a vaginal birth is more of an elective procedure, so such decisions should be made on a local level, based upon available resources. If not performed or if a reversible contraceptive method is desired, an alternative form of contraception should be provided (eg, immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) as long as the patient desires one of these methods. This avoids additional outpatient postpartum visits. (See ""Overview of female permanent contraception"" and ""Postpartum permanent contraception: Procedures"" and ""Postpartum contraception: Counseling and methods"".)Discharge from hospital — We suggest early discharge postpartum, such as one day after vaginal delivery and a maximum of two days after cesarean delivery, to limit the patient's personal risk in the hospital environment [85].Candidates for mother-infant separation after discharge and criteria for discontinuation of separation are discussed above. (See 'After hospital discharge' above.)Postpartum office visit — Modifying or reducing postpartum outpatient care is appropriate to reduce the risk of inadvertent exposure. For example, it may be possible to perform early postpartum assessments, including wound and blood pressure checks, with telehealth. A comprehensive postpartum visit may still be important by 12 weeks, especially in patients with comorbidities and in patients who lose insurance coverage at that time.All postpartum patients should still be screened for postpartum depression four to eight weeks after delivery. The most widely used instrument is the self-report, 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (figure 1A-B), which can be completed in less than five minutes [101], but alternatives are available. As discussed above, the psychological impact of COVID-19, which may include moderate to severe anxiety, should also be recognized and support offered. (See ""Postpartum unipolar major depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Assessment'.)PREGNANCY REGISTRIES — Registries are being developed to collect data of how COVID-19 affects pregnancy and newborns. For example:●Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY (PRIORITY) is the official United States registry led by the University of California, San Francisco.●International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP) is another registry led by an international group of investigators.SELECTED RESOURCES — In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued guidance regarding prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care during the COVID-19 pandemic [54,56]. This includes general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19 and suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits, obstetric ultrasound examinations, use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles, planned induction or cesarean delivery, and contact with the infant.●American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists COVID-19 information●Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine●World Health Organization●Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:•Pregnancy and Breastfeeding•Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings●International Society of Infectious Disease in Obstetrics and Gynecology Recommendations Concerning COVID-19 and Pregnancy [50].●A dedicated website (www.pregnancycovid19.com) with several helpful pregnancy-specific links and information, including information for patients.PREGNANCY REGISTRY — Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY (PRIORITY) is a nationwide United States study of pregnant or recently pregnant women who are either under investigation or who have been confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Providers and patients can send information via priority.ucsf.edu.SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Pregnant women should follow the same recommendations as nonpregnant persons for avoiding exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). (See 'Prevention' above.)●Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant women are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals. A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although false-positive and false-negative tests are possible. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)●Pregnancy does not appear to increase susceptibility to infection or worsen the clinical course, and most infected mothers recover without undergoing delivery. However, severe disease necessitating maternal intensive care unit admission and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can occur, and maternal deaths have been reported. (See 'Maternal course' above.) ●Infected women, especially those who develop pneumonia, appear to have an increased frequency of preterm birth and cesarean delivery. These complications are likely related to severe maternal illness as intrauterine infection does not appear to occur, but this is still under investigation. A few possible early newborn infections and one possible placental infection have been reported. (See 'Pregnancy complications' above and 'Vertical transmission' above.)●The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) have issued guidance regarding prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic (available at acog.org and SMFM.org), including general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19, suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal and postnatal visits and hospital discharge, and algorithms for assessment and management. These modifications are tailored for low- versus high-risk pregnancies. (See 'Prenatal care' above and 'Discharge from hospital' above and 'Postpartum office visit' above.)●For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because of the potential for adverse effects on the course of the disease. Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. (See 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications' above.)●For most women with preterm COVID-19 and nonsevere illness who have no medical/obstetric indications for prompt delivery, delivery is not indicated and ideally will occur sometime after a negative testing result is obtained or isolation status is lifted, thereby minimizing the risk of postnatal transmission to the neonate. Severely ill patients at least 32 to 34 weeks of gestation with COVID-19 pneumonia may benefit from early delivery. (See 'Timing delivery in infected women' above.)●In areas where the infection is active, we believe testing all patients upon presentation to labor and delivery (or the day before if a scheduled admission) is reasonable, if testing is available. In a city with a high infection prevalence, a high proportion of asymptomatic patients (13.5 percent in one study) admitted for delivery tested positive, which has clinical implications for triage, staff, and newborn care. (See 'Infection control precautions' above.)●Generally, management of labor is not altered in women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic or in women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in vaginal secretions or amniotic fluid, so rupture of fetal membranes and internal fetal heart rate monitoring may be performed for usual indications, but data are limited. COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery. The partner/support person should be screened in accordance with hospital policies and those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. (See 'Management of labor and delivery' above.)●In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, neuraxial anesthetic is not contraindicated and has several advantages in laboring patients. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology suggests suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in these patients because of insufficient data about potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems. (See 'Analgesia and anesthesia' above.)●At delivery of patients with known or suspected COVID-19, some institutions have chosen to avoid delayed cord clamping in term infants, in whom the benefits are modest, to minimize newborn exposure to any virus in the immediate environment and reduce the chances that the newborn will require phototherapy for jaundice. (See 'Delivery procedures' above.)●Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for treatment of postpartum pain; however, there are anecdotal reports of possible negative effects of NSAIDs in patients with COVID-19. Given the uncertainty, we use acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used. (See 'Analgesia and anesthesia' above.)●Infants born to mothers with known COVID-19 are COVID-19 suspects and should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See 'Infant evaluation' above.) ●Whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant is determined on a case-by-case basis. If the infant tests positive, separation is unnecessary. If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, other measures may be utilized to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission, including physical barriers and ≥6 feet separation, personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, and utilization of other healthy adults for infant care (feeding, diapering, bathing). (See 'Mother-baby contact' above.)●The virus has been found in some samples of breast milk, but data are limited and risk of transmission to the infant from ingestion of breast milk is unclear. Droplet transmission to the newborn could occur through close contact during feeding. In mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or symptomatic mothers with suspected COVID-19, to minimize direct contact, ideally, the infant is fed expressed breast milk by another caregiver until the mother has recovered or been proven uninfected, provided that the other caregiver is healthy and follows hygiene precautions. In such cases, the mother should wear a mask and thoroughly clean her hands and breasts before pumping; the pump parts, bottles, and artificial nipples should be cleaned as well. If she breastfeeds the infant directly, similar personal hygienic precautions should be taken. (See 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding' above.)●Several agents are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir is the most promising and has been used without reported fetal toxicity in some severely ill pregnant women.

Subsequently, the infection rapidly spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. The coronavirus is now designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness it causes is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The spectrum of COVID-19 in adults ranges from asymptomatic infection to mild respiratory tract symptoms to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction. Our understanding of the spectrum of disease as well as optimal management strategies continues to evolve.This topic will address the management of adult patients with COVID-19 (presumed and confirmed) in the outpatient setting, including self-care advice, telehealth, outpatient clinic management, and emergency department (ED) referral. It is important to note that there are limited data informing outpatient management strategies, and the approach described here is based upon our clinical experience; clinicians should take into the account the individual patient's clinical and social circumstances as well as the available resources.General management strategies, including infection control measures, care for hospitalized patients, and specific COVID-19 complications, are discussed in detail elsewhere, as are considerations for special populations:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Psychiatric symptoms and disorders"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to gastrointestinal disease in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Care of patients with systemic rheumatic disease during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)GENERAL PRINCIPLESContinuum of care — When possible, we favor managing all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 within an outpatient continuum of care management program that includes:●Self-assessment tools. (See 'Patient self-assessment tools' below.)●Initial telephone triage. (See 'Initial telephone triage' below.)●Coordinated outreach and management approach based upon individual patient risk, severity of symptoms, and time course of disease. (See 'Risk stratification' below and 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below and 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)●Clinician telehealth (telephone call or video platform-based) visits (initial evaluation and follow-up visits) [1]. (See 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)●COVID-19 testing. (See 'Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing' below.)●A separate outpatient respiratory clinic or dedicated space within an ambulatory clinic appropriated for the care of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory problems. Strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by staff and other patients should be employed [2]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)In addition, the outpatient clinic should have a close, coordinated relationship with the local emergency department (ED) and function in partnership within the continuum of care program. (See 'Rationale for outpatient management and remote care' below.)●A close working relationship with local public health officials and community leaders.In such a system, patients could enter the ambulatory COVID-19 care program by contacting their primary health care provider or following discharge from the ED or an inpatient hospital stay.In addition, during the course of illness and recovery, patients would be able to transition to different sites of care for follow-up as dictated by clinical need (eg, from home self-care management, to outpatient clinic or ED evaluation, to telehealth follow-up, and back to self-care management).Rationale for outpatient management and remote care — Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients with COVID-19; in approximately 80 percent of patients, illness is mild and does not warrant medical intervention or hospitalization [3]. In addition, remote (telehealth) management is preferred for the majority of patients for the following reasons:●Remote management can prevent unnecessary in-person medical visits, including visits to urgent care facilities and EDs. It thus avoids additional, unnecessary strain on an already overburdened and overwhelmed health care system (including utilization of limited resources, especially personal protective equipment [PPE]).●In-person health care provider visits require the patient to leave their home, traveling via public, private, or emergency transport and potentially exposing others to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, upon arrival at a health care facility, patients may expose other patients and health care workers to the virus.Creating a comprehensive, coordinated outpatient care program that incorporates these components may allow more patients to receive supportive care at home and, if necessary, in the ambulatory clinic setting, further reducing ED and hospital resource utilization.Telehealth has been used for patient management during previous disease outbreaks, including SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza A H1N1 [4]. However, remote evaluation has not been studied in the setting of a global pandemic nor in caring for patients with COVID-19; thus, evidence that demonstrates improved outcomes with home management of COVID-19 is lacking.Telehealth evaluation for COVID-19 during the pandemic can be performed by telephone call, video-based telemedicine platform, or commercial video chat platform; the format chosen should be compliant with applicable patient privacy regulations [5].Flexibility in approach to care — High-quality data supporting the superiority of any single outpatient management strategy are lacking, and treatment protocols are being developed and modified as understanding of the disease evolves.Our approach is based upon our clinical experience of treating patients with COVID-19 and places additional emphasis on avoiding infection transmission, preserving limited resources (including tests and PPE), and reducing the burden on overwhelmed health care systems.The intensity (frequency and duration) of outpatient follow-up will vary according to a patient's risk for developing severe disease (table 1), will vary by institution, region, and resource availability, and will likely change with the burden of disease in a given location. As an example, some institutions have been able to establish dedicated respiratory clinics devoted to managing COVID-19 patients, with available in-person and remote management options; in many other locations, these patients are being managed by primary care clinicians, often in consultation with a team of specially trained clinicians.Additionally, institutions may need to revise protocols, even over a several-week period, in response to surges in the number of patients with suspected infection they are managing [6].INITIAL EVALUATION — Most patients who have concerns about COVID-19, even those with mild symptoms, will likely initiate contact with the health care system. For those patients, self-assessment tools, or remote (telehealth) evaluation are the preferred initial management approaches [7-9].Patient self-assessment tools — Patient education materials, including self-assessment tools, can help patients determine if medical evaluation is necessary, and proactive dissemination of these materials may increase awareness and encourage their use. Various online self-assessment tools published by medical institutions and governmental health agencies can guide patients through questions and suggest when to seek medical care; by following the guidance, many patients with mild illness may be able to recover at home on their own without needing to come in direct contact with a health care provider. Before recommending a specific assessment tool, however, clinicians should vet the options carefully, as they may exceed the abilities of patients with limited health literacy or can become quickly out-of-date based upon rapidly changing guidelines.In one study, use of a self-assessment tool embedded into the electronic health record allowed 40 percent of symptomatic patients to be appropriately triaged to self-care [9]. This study, however, was conducted in the setting of relatively low community prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and might not be representative of settings with widespread community transmission.Initial telephone triage — In addition to self-assessment tools, an initial triage call by clinic staff can often determine which patients are appropriate for self-care at home, which patients warrant a timely clinician telehealth visit (televisit), and which patients warrant an outpatient clinic visit or urgent emergency department (ED) evaluation [10]. (See 'Risk stratification' below.) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)Any patient with symptoms suggestive of respiratory compromise or hypoxia (eg, significant dyspnea at rest or mental confusion) should be referred for urgent in-person evaluation; the appropriate site of care depends upon the severity of symptoms and is discussed elsewhere. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing — During a pandemic, patients who live in regions with widespread community transmission and have compatible symptoms are generally managed presumptively as having COVID-19, even if they have not been tested or have an initial negative test result.Patients with COVID-19 typically first experience a viral-type illness with symptoms ranging from a mild upper respiratory tract infection (eg, pharyngitis, rhinorrhea) to a lower respiratory tract infection (eg, cough, fever), influenza-like symptoms (eg, fever, chills, headache, myalgias), or gastroenteritis (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) (table 2) [11,12]. Loss of smell and taste may also occur, with olfactory loss typically reported early in the course of illness [13]. Dyspnea, if it develops, tends to occur in most patients between four to eight days after the onset of symptoms, although it can occur after 10 days [11]. In patients with less typical symptoms such as isolated rhinorrhea or headache, the likelihood of illness due to COVID-19 should take into account the local prevalence of disease. However, during a pandemic, COVID-19 cannot be ruled out based upon clinical history. Further, even in locations with a high prevalence of COVID-19, the possibility of other etiologies of symptoms should be considered. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Initial presentation' and 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' below.)Availability of testing for SARS-CoV-2 varies widely across regions. If testing capacity and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies allow, we favor widespread use of testing, including drive-through testing, which is important for epidemiologic purposes. However, when resources are limited, SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatients with mild disease may be neither readily available nor appropriate; in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have proposed priorities for testing (table 3). Specific criteria for testing vary by location, institution, and will change over time. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'COVID-19 testing not readily available'.)In patients who are able to undergo testing, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirms COVID-19. However, given sampling variability, viral load variation, and potential false-negative results, a single negative test does not exclude infection and should not guide management [14,15]. Antibody detection has less utility for diagnosis in the acute outpatient setting and should not be used as the sole test to exclude or diagnose COVID-19. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Risk stratification — Our patient-centered continuum of care management approach is based on stratification by risk for developing severe disease and close monitoring for respiratory decompensation. Patients without severe initial symptoms, who are deemed stable enough to not require immediate in-person evaluation, are risk stratified to determine the intensity (frequency and duration) of follow-up.Assess risk for severe disease — Older age and certain chronic medical conditions have been associated with more severe illness and higher mortality with COVID-19 (table 1). We categorize patients as being high, moderate, and low risk for severe disease:●High risk•Age ≥65 years •Residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility•Immunocompromising condition•Chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma•Cardiovascular disease (including hypertension)•Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40 kg/m2)•Diabetes mellitus•Chronic kidney disease (undergoing dialysis)•Cerebrovascular disease•Chronic liver disease•Tobacco use disorder●Moderate risk•Age 20 to 64 years, without any of the specific comorbidities listed above•Age <20 years, with underlying medical conditions other than those listed above●Low risk•Age <20 years, without underlying medical conditionsThese categories are based upon CDC guidance as well as data from published cohort studies, in which older age and many of these underlying conditions were associated with severe disease and death [16-19].Additionally, in the United States, black and Hispanic patients have represented a disproportionately high percentage of hospitalizations and deaths [17,18,20]. The reasons for this finding are unclear but may be related to inequalities in the social determinants of health (eg, access to health care, economic stability, living environment, community experience, education) that predispose to disease. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)It is important to note that although patients who are ≥65 years of age or have poorly controlled chronic medical conditions have a higher risk for hospitalization and death, infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause catastrophic illness in any patient, even among moderate-risk or, less frequently, low-risk patients. In addition, although the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild disease [21,22], infants and children with underlying medical conditions warrant close monitoring; severe disease is most likely to occur in children with underlying medical conditions [23]. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that has been reported in children and adolescents in association with current or recent COVID-19 infection or exposure [24-28]. It shares clinical features with Kawasaki disease (KD), KD shock, and toxic shock syndrome. The evaluation and management of children with COVID-19 exposure and infection are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".) Assess symptom duration and severityTime course and development of dyspnea — For any patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, we establish the illness timeline: the first day symptoms began, the presence of dyspnea, and the day of dyspnea onset. While mild dyspnea is common, worsening dyspnea, particularly dyspnea at rest, and more severe chest discomfort/tightness, are concerning symptoms and suggest the development or progression of pulmonary involvement. The trajectory of dyspnea over the days following its onset is particularly important, as significant worsening and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can manifest soon after the onset of dyspnea; in studies among patients who develop ARDS, progression to ARDS occurred a median of 2.5 days after onset of dyspnea [29-33]. In patients at moderate and high risk for severe illness (table 1), outreach efforts should be focused particularly on the days following the onset of dyspnea to assess for any worsening of respiratory status.It is unclear what percentage of patients with COVID-19 develop dyspnea, as available reports are likely not representative of all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, of patients with symptomatic infection, dyspnea likely develops in only a subgroup of patients. As examples, dyspnea developed in 19 percent of approximately 1000 COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China [34]. However, in a CDC study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the United States, 43 percent of symptomatic adults and 13 percent of symptomatic children developed dyspnea [23]. Among patients who develop dyspnea, it typically begins at least several days after the onset of illness. In one study of 41 hospitalized patients in China, dyspnea developed, on average, eight days after the onset of symptoms [35]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)Dyspnea assessment — Remote assessment of dyspnea should focus on the patient's subjective symptoms, as well as an objective assessment of breathing, including deterioration in respiratory function [36]. We begin by asking if patients have developed any difficulty with their breathing, other than that associated with coughing. If yes, we ask the patient to describe the difficulty in their own words and assess the ease and comfort of their speech (eg, if they can speak comfortably in complete sentences).In addition, we ask questions that provide a more objective assessment of changes in respiratory status, including [36]:●“What activities that you could previously do without difficulty are now causing you to be out of breath?”●""Has this gotten worse over the last one, two, or three days?""●“Are you breathing harder or faster than usual when sitting still?”●“Can you no longer do your usual household activities due to shortness of breath?”●“Does walking cause you to feel dizzy?”We use this assessment to categorize dyspnea by severity:●Mild dyspnea – Dyspnea that does not interfere with daily activities (eg, mild shortness of breath with activities such as climbing one to two flights of stairs or walking briskly).●Moderate dyspnea – Dyspnea that creates limitations to activities of daily living (eg, shortness of breath that limits the ability to walk up one flight of stairs without needing to rest, or interferes with meal preparation and light housekeeping tasks).●Severe dyspnea – Dyspnea that causes shortness of breath at rest, renders the patient unable to speak in complete sentences, and interferes with basic activities such as toileting and dressing.If available, telemedicine consultation with video capability may allow an even better evaluation of respiratory status, by allowing the clinician to observe the patient's respiratory pattern, including the use of accessory muscles of respiration [7].The presence of dyspnea, along with risk factors for developing severe disease (table 1), can be used to guide clinicians in determining whether a patient requires in-person evaluation. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below.)Oxygenation assessment — If a patient with COVID-19 has access to a reliable pulse oximeter at home, and can adequately measure and report the results to the clinician, measurement of oxygen saturation can be used as an additional piece of information to assess their clinical status. Patients are advised to use their pulse oximeter on warm fingers, as readings obtained on cold digits may not be as accurate [37]. In the outpatient setting, we instruct patients to check their oximetry twice daily and inform us if the value drops below 95 percent.●For any patient with an oxygen saturation of ≤94 percent on room air, in-person evaluation is warranted. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)●For patients who have an oxygen saturation of ≥95 percent on room air, the decision on in-person evaluation depends on other clinical features such as severity of dyspnea, risk for severe disease, and assessment of overall acuity. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below.)Oximetry should only be considered within the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation; a normal oxygen saturation level cannot be used to exclude clinically significant respiratory involvement in a patient with concerning symptoms such as progressive or severe dyspnea or high overall acuity level (see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' below). In addition, although normal oximetry can be reassuring, there is no guarantee that respiratory status will not deteriorate as illness progresses.Of note, we do not consider oxygen saturation readings obtained through an application (""app"") on a mobile telephone accurate enough to depend upon for clinical use [38].As with dyspnea, the availability of telemedicine with video capability may allow the indirect assessment of hypoxia by the observation of cyanosis, if present [7].Assessment of overall acuity level — In addition to evaluation of respiratory status, we assess the patient's overall acuity level by asking questions regarding orthostasis, dizziness, falls, hypotension (if home blood pressure measurement is available), mental status change (eg, lethargy, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing), observed cyanosis, and urine output. While mild orthostasis symptoms may be addressed with instruction to increase fluids, mental status changes, falls, cyanosis, hypotension, anuria, and chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are concerning and warrant in-person evaluation. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)Assess home setting and social factors — We assess the ability of patients to monitor their symptoms and to understand the importance of seeking medical guidance should symptoms progress. Patients who lack the ability to self-monitor and self-report may need more intensive staff outreach in order to be adequately managed at home.In addition, in accordance with interim CDC guidelines on home management, we assess if the patient's residential setting is appropriate for home management and recovery [39]; patients managed at home should be capable of adhering to appropriate infection control and isolation precautions for the duration of illness and recovery (including using a separate bedroom if not living alone). Other important home resources include an available caregiver, adequate access to food, and assistance with activities of daily living if necessary. Whether the patient has any household members who are at high risk for severe disease is another consideration (table 1). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.)DETERMINE IF IN-PERSON EVALUATION WARRANTED — Based upon the above assessment, in particular the risk for developing severe disease, dyspnea and oxygenation, and overall acuity level, we determine the urgency and appropriate setting (in-person evaluation versus scheduled telehealth follow-up or self-care) for further management. For those patients who warrant in-person evaluation, we decide if outpatient clinic or emergency department (ED) evaluation is appropriate. (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)While we use the following general criteria to determine the most appropriate clinical setting for in-person evaluation, these criteria are not fixed and will vary by institution, region, and even over time with changing resource availability.In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level — All patients with moderate or severe dyspnea, an initial oxygen saturation <95 percent on room air, or symptoms consistent with higher acuity level warrant in-person evaluation, either in the ED or in an outpatient clinic, depending upon the severity of findings.Criteria for evaluation in ED — We typically refer patients with one or more of the following features to the ED for further management:●Severe dyspnea (dyspnea at rest, and interfering with the inability to speak in complete sentences) (see 'Dyspnea assessment' above)●Oxygen saturation on room air of ≤90 percent, regardless of severity of dyspnea (see 'Oxygenation assessment' above)●Concerning alterations in mentation (eg, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing) or other signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion or hypoxia (eg, falls, hypotension, cyanosis, anuria, chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome)(see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above)Patients meeting the above criteria will typically be admitted to the hospital for inpatient evaluation and management. However, there are no fixed criteria for inpatient hospital admission with COVID-19; criteria vary by country and region. Further, in areas of high infection prevalence, the criteria may also vary with the availability of hospital resources. A lower threshold for hospitalization may be feasible in settings where the burden of disease does not exceed resource availability; in the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel suggests hospitalization for most patients with moderate to severe disease (eg, evidence of lower respiratory tract infection with or without hypoxia) [40]. As our inpatient hospital resources are outpaced by patient volume in the setting of a surge of COVID-19 cases, we have established an outpatient system to closely follow-up and monitor such patients who do not get admitted. However, this approach may not be appropriate in settings with more limited outpatient resources. (See 'Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic' below.)Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic — Patients with one of more of the following features are typically appropriate for evaluation in an outpatient clinic (ideally a dedicated respiratory/COVID-19 clinic if available), provided they do not meet any of the above criteria for evaluation in the ED:●Mild dyspnea in a patient with an oxygen saturation on room air between 91 to 94 percent (see 'Dyspnea assessment' above) ●Mild dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease (table 1) (see 'Assess risk for severe disease' above and 'Dyspnea assessment' above)●Moderate dyspnea in any patient●Symptoms concerning enough to warrant in-person evaluation (eg, mild orthostasis) but not severe enough to require ED referral (see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above)Clinic evaluation — For patients evaluated in an outpatient clinic (if feasible, a respiratory/COVID-19 clinic), we assess the patient's respiratory and circulatory status, and we evaluate for other potentially treatable causes of symptoms [11]. (See 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' below.)Based upon a careful clinical history and physical exam, including vital signs as well as measurements of oxygen saturation at rest and with ambulation, we then determine if the patient is appropriate for self-care, home management with telehealth follow-up, or transfer to the ED. Of note, we have found chest imaging to be of limited utility in the evaluation of most patients with COVID-19 in the outpatient clinic; the patient's clinical presentation is a more important consideration in our management decision. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.)The capability to manage patients in an ambulatory setting (eg, the ability to administer intravenous fluids and medications and to arrange for outpatient follow-up) will vary between institutions and by region and thus influence this decision. In addition, we also consider the patient's home setting and social factors in determining the appropriateness of continued outpatient (clinic and teleheath) management.Home oxygen therapy with oximetry for some patients — For some patients with COVID-19, stable dyspnea, and mild hypoxia, we consider providing home oxygen therapy with home oximetry monitoring if such services are available.In order to consider patients for home oxygen therapy with home oximetry for management of COVID-19, we use the following criteria:●The patient has nonsevere (mild or moderate) dyspnea, with stable, nonprogressive symptoms over several days.●Oxygen saturation is 91 to 93 percent and increases to ≥95 percent with administration of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 liters/minute; we do not titrate to a saturation above 96 percent.●The patient is likely to be adherent with therapy and recommended follow-up.Initiation of home oxygen therapy is not appropriate for patients with new onset of dyspnea and hypoxia early in the onset of illness. Severe pulmonary involvement may develop even among patients at low risk for severe disease, and the need for supplemental oxygen early in the course of illness suggests the need for hospital admission and close monitoring. In addition, in any patient with an increasing oxygen requirement at any point during the course of illness, hospitalization is often indicated.Patients sent home on oxygen therapy require close follow-up; daily clinician telehealth visits are scheduled, and patients are instructed to check oximetry three times daily. Patients receiving home oxygen should contact a clinician if:●Oxygen saturation levels are declining on the established flow rate. In such cases, remote clinician evaluation is performed to determine if in-person reevaluation is warranted. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' above.)●The oxygen saturation level drops below 91 percent, in which case ED evaluation is indicated. (See 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above.)●Worsening dyspnea develops, in which case in-person reevaluation is warranted independent of oximetry results. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' above.)Guidelines on managing critically ill patients with COVID-19 suggest initiating supplemental oxygen when the oxygenation saturation is <90 percent [41]. However, there are no data that inform outcomes using home oxygen and oximetry monitoring in outpatients with COVID-19 or that address optimal oxygen titration in such patients. Additionally, some guidelines suggest that COVID-19 patients with an oxygen saturation of ≤93 percent on room air be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management [40]. Nevertheless, our approach is based upon our clinical experience managing patients with COVID-19 in a setting where inpatient hospital resources are limited due to surging patient volume, and we have established a system to closely follow-up and monitor these patients in the outpatient setting. This approach may not be appropriate in settings with more limited outpatient resources. Ideally, home oxygen therapy and monitoring should be evaluated in the setting of a clinical trial or a rapid-cycle quality improvement project to determine if such an intervention can decrease the use of health care facilities (eg, clinic visits, hospitalizations) without negatively impacting health outcomes.In addition, health insurance coverage restrictions may limit the use of home oxygen therapy for these patients, and out-of-pocket costs may be prohibitive for some patients without health insurance.Some patients warrant transfer from clinic to ED — After initial evaluation in the outpatient clinic, some patients may require more intensive management in the ED. In particular, some patients may require ED management if they have an increased work of breathing or a history of a rapid decline in respiratory function. Additional criteria for ED evaluation are reviewed elsewhere. (See 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above.)Home management without in-person evaluation for others — The majority of patients without moderate or severe dyspnea or hypoxia can remain at home for management without in-person evaluation, if they can reliably report worsened symptoms and can self-isolate for the anticipated duration of illness.The components of home management and counseling for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are discussed elsewhere. (See 'Management and counseling for all outpatients' below.)Whether such patients warrant telehealth follow-up depends upon their risk for severe disease and the extent of dyspnea (table 1):●Patients who are not at high risk for severe disease, and have no dyspnea are discharged to self-care at home; they do not need in-person evaluation or scheduled follow-up telehealth visits. They receive instructions to contact their clinician with any worsening symptoms.●Patients who are not at high risk for severe disease, and who have mild dyspnea, do not need in-person evaluation but are scheduled for telehealth follow-up visits.●Patients who are high risk for severe disease, and with no dyspnea, are scheduled for telehealth follow-up visits.The frequency and content of follow-up telehealth evaluation is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)Supervised residential care to facilitate isolation — Patients who would be appropriate for home care (with or without telehealth follow-up) but are unable to be adequately managed in their usual residential setting are candidates for temporary shelter in supervised residential care facilities, if available [42].In particular, patients who may be unable to adequately self-isolate (eg, patients living in multigenerational households, patients living with other high-risk individuals (table 1), patients experiencing homelessness) should be provided resources such as dedicated housing units, where available. Disruption of families should be minimized as much as possible. Every attempt should be made to avoid hospitalization simply for the purpose of facilitating self-isolation, as this option is typically not realistically available in regions with widespread disease.Unfortunately, dedicated residential care facilities for COVID-19 patients are not widely available in many countries and regions, and community-based solutions to self-isolation should be explored.MANAGEMENT AND COUNSELING FOR ALL OUTPATIENTS — When clinically appropriate, it is generally preferable to manage patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 remotely via telehealth visits. (See 'Rationale for outpatient management and remote care' above.)Interim recommendations on the outpatient management of patients with COVID-19 are provided by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, and several academic medical centers [43-46]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)Infection control — With all patients, we reinforce the importance of infection control and self-isolation and provide instructions on the anticipated duration of isolation. These are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.)Symptom management — Symptomatic treatment includes antipyretics and analgesics for myalgias and headaches and maintenance of oral fluid intake. We generally prefer acetaminophen; however, we inform patients that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use is acceptable if symptoms do not respond to acetaminophen. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Some patients with cough or dyspnea may experience symptomatic improvement with self-proning (resting in the prone rather than the supine position) [47]. However, patients are cautioned that progressive respiratory symptoms, particularly worsening dyspnea, should prompt contact with their clinician for further evaluation. (See 'Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea' below.)Managing other potential causes of symptoms — Since symptoms of COVID-19 can overlap with those of many common conditions, it is important to consider other possible etiologies of symptoms including other respiratory infections (eg, influenza, streptococcal pharyngitis, community-acquired pneumonia [CAP]), congestive heart failure, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and even anxiety (table 2) [11].For conditions that can be treated remotely, such as possible streptococcal pharyngitis, mild asthma exacerbations, or mild exacerbations of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), we will often treat without an in-person evaluation but with scheduled daily follow-up telehealth visits. Management of specific medical conditions is discussed in the relevant UpToDate topic reviews.The prevalence of other diseases should also be considered. As an example, in regions where COVID-19 is prevalent and seasonal influenza activity remains high, patients who have symptoms consistent with both conditions should be treated empirically for influenza.We also consider the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community in our determination whether to evaluate the patient in-person; clinical judgement, however, remains the most important consideration in this decision. As an example, in regions where COVID-19 prevalence is high, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize in-person evaluations if possible; remote evaluation and management of mild dyspnea, if clinically appropriate, is preferred. (See 'Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea' below and 'Consider additional causes of worsening dyspnea' below.)Limited role for COVID-19 specific therapy — A number of therapies are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, but none have proven efficacy. Some of these, such as hydroxychloroquine, are available for other indications but remain investigational for COVID-19. Medications for COVID-19 specific therapy should not be prescribed in the ambulatory setting outside of a clinical trial [48]; data are extremely limited, and there are concerns for potential toxicity in an unmonitored setting [49].A catalog of clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org; the list of trials can be filtered by setting (eg, outpatient versus inpatient).Therapies under evaluation for treatment COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Medication management — In general, the patient’s usual home medication regimen is not adjusted, although some changes may be needed. We advise patients who use nebulized medications to avoid their use in the presence of others and to use a metered dose inhaler preparation instead, when possible, to avoid potential aerosolization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Avoiding nebulized medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)'.)If patients already use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) device for management of obstructive sleep apnea, they may continue to use their machine; as with nebulizers, they are advised to use the device only when isolated from others.For patients taking an immunomodulating medication, we consult with the prescribing clinician about the relative risks and benefits of temporarily discontinuing it, which depend upon its indication and the severity of the underlying condition. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Adjusting immunosuppression' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Care of patients with systemic rheumatic disease during the pandemic"", section on 'Medication management with documented or presumptive COVID-19'.)Thromboprophylaxis may be appropriate for certain patients, such as those at high risk of venous thromboembolism. This is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis'.)Management of medications is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Managing chronic medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Avoiding nebulized medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Immunomodulatory agents' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis'.)Counseling on warning symptoms — We counsel all patients on the warning symptoms that should prompt reevaluation by telehealth visit and in-person, including emergency department (ED) evaluations. These include new onset of dyspnea, worsening dyspnea, dizziness, and mental status changes such as confusion. Patients are educated about the time course of symptoms and the possible development of respiratory decline that may occur, on average, one week after the onset of illness. In addition, we assess the availability of support at home, ensure that they know who to call should they need assistance, and reinforce when and how to access emergency medical services.Patients with obstructive lung disease (eg, COPD or asthma) are specifically advised to closely monitor their respiratory status, and are cautioned not to presume that any worsening shortness of breath is due to an exacerbation of their underlying lung disease.Addressing goals of care — Given the potential severity of COVID-19, all patients should have updated health care proxy and advance directive information in their electronic health record.For patients with significant underlying medical comorbidities and poor health status, COVID-19 may cause catastrophic illness including respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among such patients, those who develop life-threatening complications are likely to have a poor outcome despite the use of aggressive measures such as mechanical ventilation. For patients who are at highest risk of complications and who have the lowest likelihood of survival, the appropriateness of hospitalization and ventilator assistance should be discussed in advance of significant deterioration in clinical condition. For these patients, it may be appropriate to address home palliative care strategies in anticipation of need. Many institutions have palliative care and hospice programs to provide skilled nursing and social work support for patients and families. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Surge capacity and scarce resource allocation' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'End of life issues' and ""Advance care planning and advance directives"", section on 'COVID-19 resources'.)Convalescent plasma donation — We encourage all eligible patients to donate convalescent plasma after their recovery from COVID-19. To be eligible for plasma donation, patients must meet general criteria for blood donation (which were revised by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] in April, 2020 to increase the potential blood donor pool) and specific COVID-19 recovery guidelines [50]. (See ""Blood donor screening: Medical history"", section on 'COVID-19 pandemic revised deferral criteria' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)TELEHEALTH FOLLOW-UPFrequency of follow-up — For patients with COVID-19 determined to be appropriate for home management with telehealth follow-up, the frequency of telehealth visits is determined by their risk for severe disease (table 1), severity of respiratory symptoms, and our comfort level with their ability to self-report worsening symptoms. (See 'Home management without in-person evaluation for others' above.)●For most patients, telehealth visits are scheduled on days 4, 7, and 10 (following the onset of clinical illness).●However, for patients in whom we have the highest level of concern, we generally schedule the first follow-up telehealth visit within 24 hours. These include:•Patients aged ≥65 years who have one or more additional risk factors for severe disease (table 1)•Any patient with moderate dyspnea at the time of initial evaluation•Patients who we feel may not reliably report a deterioration in symptomsFor these patients, the frequency of subsequent telehealth visits can be reduced to every other day if the patient remains clinically stable.Repeat assessment of dyspnea and hypoxia — At each telehealth visit, we evaluate a patient's respiratory status, focusing on assessing for new or worsening dyspnea and hypoxia, as these are the most likely indications requiring in-person clinical reevaluation and potential hospitalization. In addition, we assess overall acuity level, ensuring that the patient remains clinically stable enough for remote management. (See 'Dyspnea assessment' above and 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above.)Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea — All patients who develop worsening or more severe dyspnea require further evaluation and management. We use the same criteria for determining whether a patient needs to be evaluated in-person as in our initial evaluation. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' above.)For patients who do not meet criteria for in-person evaluation, and who have potentially treatable causes of dyspnea by clinical history (eg, anxiety, mild exacerbation of congestive heart failure, mild asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations), we typically treat these conditions remotely. However, these patients are closely followed with daily telehealth visits for at least the next several days or until they are improving. The frequency and duration of subsequent follow-up is determined by their clinical course.Dyspnea severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living or cause difficulty with speaking requires an in-person evaluation. Further, new dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease should prompt an in-person evaluation (table 1). The in-person evaluation should occur in the most appropriate clinical setting, depending upon the severity of dyspnea, and may vary by health care system. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' above.)Consider additional causes of worsening dyspnea — In addition, even though some patients with worsening symptoms may be managed remotely, we perform an in-person evaluation if they have complaints suggestive of serious conditions or complications that are not amenable to telehealth management, such as severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; eg, new productive cough, pleuritic chest discomfort), asthma or COPD exacerbation (eg, cough, increasing wheezing), pulmonary embolism (eg, worsening dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis), heart failure (increasing dyspnea, edema, orthopnea) or acute pericarditis (eg, chest pain). This evaluation can take place in a respiratory (COVID-19) clinic or appropriate clinical care setting. Discussion of the evaluation and management of these conditions can be found in the relevant UpToDate topics.In particular, patients with suspected COVID-19 and dyspnea who have underlying obstructive lung disease (including COPD and asthma) present unique management challenges. For such patients, dyspnea may be simply due to an exacerbation of obstruction, and it is not possible to differentiate clinically between an isolated exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease and an exacerbation related to COVID-19. In such cases, a presumptive asthma or COPD exacerbation should be treated with a short course of oral corticosteroids and increased use of short-acting beta agonists. Patients on home oxygen at baseline should be evaluated for increased oxygen requirements. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"".)OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT FOLLOWING INPATIENT OR ED DISCHARGE — After discharge from the inpatient hospital setting or the emergency department (ED), clinician follow-up is warranted, either in outpatient clinic or via telehealth visit. At each encounter after hospital or ED discharge, we reinforce the importance of infection control and provide counseling on the warning symptoms which should prompt reevaluation. (See 'Infection control' above and 'Counseling on warning symptoms' above.)In some cases, patients are discharged home or to supervised residential care from the inpatient hospital setting on low flow oxygen therapy, with oximetry monitoring by telehealth (preferred if available) or visiting nurse. The practice of sending patients home on supplemental oxygen is widely variable, however, and if done warrants close patient monitoring. (See 'Home oxygen therapy with oximetry for some patients' above.)Patients discharged home●Most patients discharged from the inpatient setting require a follow-up clinician visit within one to two days following discharge; depending on their unique clinical and social situation, telehealth visit or in-person outpatient visit may be appropriate.●For those patients evaluated and discharged from the ED and who are felt to need follow-up care, telehealth visits may also be appropriate. The timing of such visits, however, would vary depending upon patient acuity and indication.Patients discharged to supervised residential care for recovery — As part of the continuum of care of patients with COVID-19, temporary housing in supervised residential care facilities may also be appropriate for managing patients discharged from the inpatient hospital setting, as well as those evaluated and discharged from the ED. (See 'Supervised residential care to facilitate isolation' above.)Depending upon the type of facility, the patient's medical acuity, and available resources, telehealth follow-up may be appropriate; the intensity of telehealth follow-up will vary depending upon the indication for housing (eg, solely the need for isolation versus isolation with more acute medical need).SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Our understanding of the spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as optimal management strategies continues to evolve. There are limited data informing outpatient management strategies, and the approach described here is based upon our clinical experience; clinicians should take into account the individual patient's clinical and social circumstances as well as the available resources. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. When possible, we favor a coordinated care management program that includes initial risk stratification, clinician telehealth visits (telephone call or video platform-based), a dedicated outpatient respiratory clinic, and a close relationship with a local emergency department (ED). (See 'General principles' above.)●Patients who live in regions with widespread community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have compatible symptoms are generally managed presumptively as having COVID-19, even if they have not been tested or have an initial negative test result (table 2). (See 'Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing' above.)●On initial evaluation, we assess risk factors for severe disease (table 1), dyspnea severity and duration (and oxygenation status of those with dyspnea), overall level of acuity, and the patient’s home setting to determine who warrants an in-person evaluation at an outpatient clinic or in the ED. The additional criteria we use to make this determination are not fixed and will vary by institution, region, and over time as resource availability evolves. (See 'Risk stratification' above.) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)We typically refer patients with one or more of the following features to the ED for further management (see 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above):•Severe dyspnea (dyspnea at rest, and interfering with the inability to speak in complete sentences)•Oxygen saturation on room air of ≤90 percent, regardless of severity of dyspnea•Concerning alterations in mentation (eg, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing) or other signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion or hypoxia (eg, falls, hypotension, cyanosis, anuria, chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome)We refer patients for evaluation in an outpatient clinic if they have one or more of the following features without any of the preceding features (see 'Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic' above):•Mild dyspnea in a patient with an oxygen saturation on room air between 91 to 94 percent•Mild dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease (table 1)•Moderate dyspnea in any patient•Symptoms concerning enough to warrant in-person evaluation (eg, mild orthostasis) but not severe enough to require ED referralOther patients can generally remain at home for management without in-person evaluation if they can reliably report worsened symptoms and can self-isolate for the anticipated duration of illness. Whether such patients warrant telehealth follow-up depends upon their risk for severe disease and the extent of dyspnea. (See 'Home management without in-person evaluation for others' above.)●When managing outpatients with COVID-19 (see 'Management and counseling for all outpatients' above):•We reinforce the importance of infection control and self-isolation. Instructions for home isolation (including the duration) is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.)•Symptoms of COVID-19 can overlap with those of many common conditions, so it is important to consider other possible etiologies of symptoms including other respiratory infections, congestive heart failure, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and even anxiety. For conditions that can be treated remotely, we will often treat without an in-person evaluation but with scheduled daily follow-up telehealth visits. (See 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' above.)•A number of therapies are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, but none have proven efficacy. None of these treatments should be prescribed in the ambulatory setting outside of a clinical trial; data are extremely limited, and there are concerns for potential toxicity in an unmonitored setting. (See 'Limited role for COVID-19 specific therapy' above.)•In general, the patient’s usual home medication regimen is not adjusted. However, we advise patients who use nebulized medications to avoid their use in the presence of others. (See 'Medication management' above.)•We counsel all patients on the warning symptoms that should prompt reevaluation by telehealth visit and in-person, including ED evaluations. (See 'Counseling on warning symptoms' above.)•All patients should have updated health care proxy and advance directive information in their electronic health record. (See 'Addressing goals of care' above.)•We encourage all eligible patients to donate convalescent plasma after their recovery from COVID-19. (See 'Convalescent plasma donation' above.)●On follow-up (eg, by telehealth visit), we evaluate a patient's respiratory status, focusing on assessing for new or worsening dyspnea. We use the same criteria for determining whether a patient needs to be evaluated in-person as in our initial evaluation. (See 'Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea' above and 'Consider additional causes of worsening dyspnea' above.)●Most patients discharged from the inpatient setting warrant clinician follow-up within one to two days following discharge; whether a telehealth or in-person outpatient visit is most appropriate depends on their unique clinical and social situation. Temporary housing in supervised residential care facilities, when available, may also be appropriate for some patients discharged from the inpatient hospital setting. (See 'Outpatient management following inpatient or ED discharge' above.)", severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness it causes is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [2]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV. The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [3].Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the WHO and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [4,5]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)This topic will discuss aspects of COVID-19 that are specific to children. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; more general aspects of the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19; management of COVID-19 adults; and other coronaviruses are discussed separately.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronaviruses"".)●(See ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"".)●(See ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The epidemiology of COVID-19 is discussed in detail separately. This section focuses on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in children. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Epidemiology'.) Can children get COVID-19? — Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less commonly than adults [6-11]. In a systematic literature review (from January 1 through March 18, 2020), children accounted for 1 to 5 percent of diagnosed COVID-19 cases [12]. Although surveillance definitions and criteria for testing have changed over time and geographically, the proportion of cases that have occurred in children from various countries (eg, China, South Korea, Italy, and the United States) are typically within this range [9,13-16].As of April 2, 2020, among the 149,760 laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 1.7 percent were in children <18 years; approximately 70 percent of these cases were from New York City, the rest of New York state, and New Jersey [9]. Approximately 90 percent of cases were associated with household or community exposure, and 10 percent were associated with travel.Although health care-associated outbreaks have been reported in children [17,18], most cases in children result from household exposure [9]. In retrospective studies of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from China, the household secondary attack rate among pediatric contacts has ranged from 4 to 7 percent [19,20]. In a review of cases from New York state (excluding New York City), the secondary attack rate among children <18 years was 27 percent [21]. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)The age distribution of cases in the United States was as follows [9]:●<1 year – 15 percent●1 to 4 years – 11 percent●5 to 9 years – 15 percent●10 to 14 years – 27 percent●15 to 17 years – 32 percentAlthough infants <1 year of age accounted for 15 percent of confirmed cases, the proportion of all cases that have occurred in infants (0.27 percent) is less than the proportion of the United States population that is <1 year of age [9].Among adult patients with COVID-19 in the United States, emerging data suggest that COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minority groups, perhaps related to underlying health conditions and economic and social conditions (eg, poverty, multigenerational households, employment in essential industries, lack of paid sick leave, limited access to medical care) [22-25]. The CDC's COVID-NET provides race/ethnicity information for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in children [26].Additional information related to COVID-19 activity in the United States (eg, outpatient visits, hospitalization) is available through the CDC's COVIDView. Can SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted through breast milk or during infant feeding? — It is unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk. The only report of testing found no virus in the maternal milk of six patients [27]. However, droplet transmission could occur through close contact during feeding (breastfeeding or bottle feeding). Strategies to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during infant feeding are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)Can SARS-CoV-2 be acquired in utero? — Issues related to COVID-19 in pregnancy, including in utero transmission, are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSAre the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than adults? — The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults, but fewer children than adults with documented infection report symptoms [9,10]. COVID-19 appears to be milder in children than in adults, although severe cases have been reported [28]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?' below.)Among 2572 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children <18 years reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by April 2, 2020, the median age was 11 years (range 0 to 17 years); 57 percent of cases were in boys [9]. In case series from China, the median age of affected children was approximately 7 years (range 1 day to 18 years); boys were affected slightly more often than girls (57 to 60 percent of cases) [6,7].In young infants, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause fever without an on obvious source and minimal respiratory symptoms [29,30]. In a case series of three infants from a single institution, all of the infants presented with fever and difficulty feeding; lymphopenia and thrombocytosis were consistent laboratory findings [30]. Fever and cough are the most common reported symptoms in children [7,9,31,32]. In the case series from the United States, complete information about symptoms was available for 291 children; 56 percent had fever, 54 percent had cough, and 13 percent has shortness of breath; 73 percent of children had at least one of these symptoms [9]. In another series of 1391 children evaluated for COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital, 171 (12 percent) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (via identification of RNA) [7]. Approximately 16 percent of children with confirmed infection were asymptomatic, 19 percent had upper respiratory infection, and 65 percent had pneumonia. Fever occurred at some point of illness in approximately 42 percent. Other common symptoms in this case series included cough (49 percent) and pharyngeal erythema (46 percent). Less common symptoms included fatigue, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, diarrhea, and vomiting. Similar clinical manifestations have been reported in smaller case series from China and Italy [31,33]. Some children presented with only gastrointestinal symptoms [6]. Additional symptoms that have been reported in adults include chills or shaking chills, myalgia, headache, and new loss of taste or smell [34]. Cutaneous findings have been reported infrequently and are not well characterized; they include maculopapular, urticarial, and vesicular eruptions and transient livedo reticularis [31,35-37]. Reddish-purple nodules on the distal digits (sometimes called ""COVID toes"") similar in appearance to pernio (chilblains) are described predominantly in children and young adults, although an association with COVID-19 has not been clearly established [35,38-41].Laboratory findings in children with confirmed infection from Wuhan were variable. Approximately one-quarter had white blood cell count <5.5 x 109/L (5500/microL) and 3.5 percent had lymphocyte count <1.2 x 109/L (1200/microL) [7]. Procalcitonin was elevated (>46 pg/mL) in 64 percent and C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated (>10 mg/L) in 20 percent. In adult patients, lymphopenia (specifically CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes [42]), elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, CRP, ferritin) have been associated with increased severity or worse outcomes. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)Chest radiographs may be unremarkable or demonstrate bilateral consolidation [43,44]. In a series of 171 children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, findings on chest computed tomography included ground glass opacity in 33 percent, local patchy shadowing in 19 percent, bilateral patchy shadowing in 12 percent, and interstitial abnormalities in 1 percent [7]. Radiographic findings may be present before symptoms [45,46]. In a study of eight Italian children hospitalized with documented COVID-19, findings on lung ultrasonography included subpleural consolidations and individual or confluent B lines [47]. These findings were concordant with radiographic findings in seven of the eight patients. They are similar to findings in adult patients with COVID-19. (See ""Bedside pleural ultrasonography: Equipment, technique, and the identification of pleural effusion and pneumothorax"", section on 'B lines and lung consolidation' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Clinical features and complications'.)Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?Frequency of severe disease in children — Although severe cases of COVID-19 in children, including fatal cases, have been reported, most children appear to have asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease and recover within one to two weeks of disease onset [6-9,28,33,48-57].In a series of 2135 children from China that included 728 children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease, approximately 55 percent of all cases were mild or asymptomatic, 40 percent of cases were moderate (eg, clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia without hypoxemia), 5 percent of cases were severe (eg, dyspnea, central cyanosis, hypoxemia), and <1 percent were critical (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock) [6]. Among the 376 infants <1 year of age with available information, approximately 11 percent had severe or critical disease. These findings should be interpreted with caution; many of the severe and critical cases were not laboratory confirmed and may have been caused by other respiratory infections. Potential risk factors for severe disease — Infants <1 year of age and children with certain serious underlying conditions appear to be at greater risk for severe disease [9,58]. The CDC's COVID-NET provides information about underlying medical conditions according to age [26], although robust evidence associating underlying conditions with severe illness in children is lacking [59]. Among 345 children from the United States with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and complete information about underlying conditions, 23 percent had an underlying condition. The most commonly reported underlying conditions were [9]:●Chronic pulmonary disease (including moderate to severe asthma)●Cardiovascular disease●Immunosuppression (eg, related to cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplant, high doses of glucocorticoids)In a cross-sectional study of 48 children admitted to pediatric intensive care units in North America, 40 children had underlying conditions [57]. The most common underlying conditions were medical complexity (defined as dependence on technological support in association with developmental delay and/or genetic anomalies) in 19, immune suppression or malignancy in 11, and obesity in 7. Although immunosuppression has been reported as an underlying condition in children with severe COVID-19 disease in some case series, the relationship between immune compromise and severe COVID-19 disease has not been well established. In a review of 178 children with cancer from a single institution in New York City, 20 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and only one required admission (noncritical) for symptoms related to COVID-19 [60]. COVID-19 was similarly mild in small surveys of children who developed COVID-19 while receiving immunosuppressive medications for kidney disease or inflammatory bowel disease [61,62].Other medical conditions that may increase the risk of severe disease in children based on data from adults include [55,58,63,64]:●Chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis●Chronic liver disease (eg, chronic hepatitis)●Endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus)●Severe obesity (body mass index ≥120 percent of the 95th percentile values; (figure 1A-B)) (see ""Definition, epidemiology, and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents"")Why COVID-19 appears to be less common and severe in children than in adults is unclear. Some considerations are a less intense immune response to the virus in children versus adults; cytokine release syndrome is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infections [65,66]. Another explanation is that viral interference in the respiratory tract of young children leads to a lower viral load in children. Finally, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, which may be expressed differently in the respiratory tract of children compared with adults [6,12,67,68].Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children — Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 that has been reported in children from Europe and North America. The clinical features of MIS-C are similar to those of Kawasaki disease, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and toxic shock syndrome. They include persistent fever, hypotension, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, myocarditis, and laboratory findings associated with increased inflammation; respiratory symptoms may be lacking (table 1). MIS-C is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)How often do children with COVID-19 require hospitalization? — A minority of children with COVID-19 require hospitalization, and very few require intensive care [7,9,69]. In case series, hospitalization and intensive care admission were more common among children with underlying conditions and infants <1 year of age, although hospitalization of infants may not reflect severity of illness. (See 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?' above.)Among 2572 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children <18 years reported to the CDC by April 2, 2020, the estimated rate of hospitalization ranged from 6 to 20 percent, and the estimated rate of intensive care ranged from 0.58 to 2 percent [9]. In another series of 171 children from China with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, three children required intensive care and mechanical ventilation; all had coexisting conditions (one each with hydronephrosis, leukemia, and intussusception) [7]. By March 8, 2020, 87 percent of children had been discharged from the hospital, and one child died four weeks after admission (a 10-month old with concomitant intussusception who developed multiorgan failure). In a study from the Lombardy region of Italy, only 4 of 1591 patients (<1 percent) admitted to intensive care units with COVID-19 were younger than 20 years [69]. Additional information regarding hospitalization of children in the United States is available through the CDC's COVIDView.How should I evaluate a child with pharyngitis during the pandemic? — Given concerns SARS-CoV-2 may be spread from the upper airway of symptomatic or asymptomatic children [70], the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests avoidance of examination of the oropharynx unless it is essential [71]. When examination of the oropharynx is necessary (including obtaining oropharyngeal swabs), personal protective equipment should be worn, whether or not the child has symptoms compatible with COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)APPROACH TO DIAGNOSISWhat are the criteria for testing for COVID-19 in children? — Criteria for testing for COVID-19 vary geographically. In the United States, guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Infectious Diseases Society of America (table 2) may be adapted by state and local health departments depending upon test availability [72-74].Testing criteria suggested by the World Health Organization can be found in its technical guidance online. These are the same criteria used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Guidance for testing in other countries is discussed separately. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Outpatient testing criteria — The approach to testing varies according to test availability and other resources (eg, some communities have begun to offer COVID-19 testing to residents regardless of symptoms or previous testing).Given limited testing resources, our institutions perform targeted testing in the outpatient setting.For children who are evaluated for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (eg, fever, persistent cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea) in the emergency department or urgent care setting, we perform testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) if the child has:●An underlying condition that may increase the risk for severe disease; examples include:•An immune-compromising condition (eg, recipients of antineoplastic chemotherapy, recent hematopoietic cell transplantation, solid organ transplant recipients, primary immunodeficiency, HIV infection with CD4 count <15 percent)•Chronic cardiac disease (eg, cardiomyopathy, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, single ventricle physiology)•Chronic pulmonary disease (eg, requirement for supplemental oxygenation or noninvasive ventilation, severe persistent asthma)•Former preterm infants•Neuromuscular disease with impaired airway clearance•Poorly controlled type I diabetes mellitus•Severe obesity (body mass index ≥120 percent of the 95th percentile values; (figure 1A-B))●Known in-person exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 14 days●Presentation with severe illness (eg, new requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline, new or increased need for ventilation [invasive or noninvasive] [59])One of the authors' institutions has instituted a ""drive-thru"" assessment center for symptomatic patients (eg, fever, persistent cough) who are otherwise stable but have either:●Underlying conditions (eg, immune compromise, chronic cardiac or pulmonary disease)●Known in-person exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 14 daysThis assessment center also provides COVID-19 screening assessment before scheduled procedures (eg, cardiac catheterization, endoscopy).Inpatient testing criteria — Our institutions perform universal testing of hospitalized patients at the time of presentation, regardless of clinical symptoms or signs of COVID-19; infants born in the institution to a mother who tested negative for COVID-19 and are admitted to the nursery or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are an exception. This strategy was implemented to reduce hospital-associated transmission, given the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in children.For hospitalized children whose initial test results are negative and are scheduled for procedures (eg, endoscopy), we retest within 48 hours of the scheduled procedure.For patients with suspected nosocomial acquisition of a respiratory virus, we test for common respiratory pathogens (eg, via multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) as well as COVID-19.Laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 — Laboratory tests for COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Detection of other respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in nasopharyngeal specimens does not exclude COVID-19 [32,55,66,75-78]. In one study, 8 of 20 children positive for SARS-CoV-2 were also positive for other common respiratory pathogens [79].MANAGEMENTShould NSAIDs be avoided? — The uncertainty about the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Assessment of severity — We use the definitions of severity provided in the multicenter initial guidance on the use of antivirals for children with COVID-19 [59]:●Mild or moderate disease – No new or increased supplemental oxygen requirement●Severe disease – New requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline without new or increased need for ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive)●Critical disease – New or increased need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, sepsis, multiorgan failure, or rapidly worsening clinical trajectoryInpatient management of children with COVID-19 — Children with COVID-19 and severe or critical lower respiratory tract disease generally require hospital admission. Children with nonsevere COVID-19 may require hospital admission if they are at risk for severe disease due to underlying conditions (eg, immune compromise).Supportive care for all patients — We provide supportive care for all pediatric patients with COVID-19 as recommended by various national committees [59,80,81]. Supportive care is the mainstay of therapy for children with severe or critical COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 improve with supportive care, even those with severe disease [59,82]. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Routine supportive care measures includes:●Provision of respiratory support, including supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive); respiratory status may change suddenly after approximately one week of symptoms [83].●Provision of fluid and electrolyte support. (See ""Fluid and electrolyte therapy in newborns"" and ""Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children"" and ""Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children"".)●Provision of empiric antibiotics as indicated for community-acquired or health care-associated pneumonia; continuation of empiric antibiotics should be determined by cultures and other microbial tests and clinical condition. Bacterial coinfections appear to be infrequent [84]. (See ""Pneumonia in children: Inpatient treatment"".)●Monitoring for cytokine release syndrome by monitoring blood pressure for hypotension, oxygen saturation for worsening hypoxemia, and biomarkers. We obtain baseline C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). We monitor CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, and LDH two or three times per week or if there is concern for worsening disease. IL-6 is performed offsite; we repeat it twice per week if it is elevated at baseline or if there is concern for worsening disease.For children receiving immunosuppressive therapy, we discuss the benefits and risks of reducing immunosuppressive therapy with the prescribing specialist (eg, oncologist, transplant clinician, rheumatologist) [85]. Although the relationship between immune compromise and severe COVID-19 disease has not been well established in children [61,62], management of viral infections in immunocompromised hosts typically includes reduction of baseline immunosuppression, if reduction is possible [86,87]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Adjusting immunosuppression'.)Antiviral therapy for select patients — Given the lack of data from controlled trials supporting the efficacy of antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19 in children, we agree with recommendations from the multicenter initial guidance on the use of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 and other experts that antiviral therapy for COVID-19 should occur in the context of a clinical trial [59,88]. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from ClinicalTrials.gov.Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 generally should be reserved for children with documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection if testing is available [59].●Potential indications – Decisions to use antiviral therapy should be individualized according to disease severity, clinical trajectory, and underlying conditions that may increase the risk for progression. Studies of the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapy have predominantly been performed in adults with severe lower respiratory tract disease [89,90]; these studies are discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Specific treatments'.)Children with COVID-19 in whom the risks of unproven antiviral therapy may be warranted include those with severe or critical disease and those with mild or moderate disease and an underlying condition that may increase the risk of severe disease.●Choice of agent/regimen•Remdesivir – When a decision is made to use antiviral therapy, we agree with the multicenter panel that remdesivir is preferred to other agents. Although data regarding the benefits of remdesivir for children with COVID-19 are lacking, it is preferred to other antiviral agents because emerging data from comparative, randomized trials and case series in adult patients suggest that it may be beneficial and appears to be well tolerated [59,91,92]. Studies of remdesivir in adult patients with COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Remdesivir'.)Remdesivir is dosed according to weight as follows: -≥3.5 to <40 kg: 5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) loading dose on day 1, followed by 2.5 mg/kg IV every 24 hours for 5 to 10 days (5 days for those with a rapid clinical response)-≥40 kg: 200 mg IV loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV every 24 hours for 5 to 10 days (5 days for those with a rapid clinical response)Remdesivir is a prodrug of a nucleotide analog that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and has activity against coronaviruses [93-95]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for hospitalized children and adults with severe COVID-19 (ie, oxygen saturation ≤94 percent on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) [96].Reported adverse effects of remdesivir include nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations.•Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine – The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Although hydroxychloroquine is being investigated as a treatment for COVID-19, it is not licensed for this indication [97]. It is ideally used only in hospitalized patients in the context of a clinical trial [98].Hydroxychloroquine (without azithromycin) is an alternative to remdesivir for children who warrant antiviral therapy who are not candidates for remdesivir or if remdesivir is unavailable [59]. Given the lack of proven benefit and potential risks, we use it only in the context of a clinical trial. Hydroxychloroquine should be avoided in children with underlying QTc abnormalities and those who require other medications with potential for serious drug interaction with hydroxychloroquine. Before initiating hydroxychloroquine, specific interactions with other medications should be checked by use of a drug interactions program, such as the Lexicomp drug interactions tool provided by UpToDate.The multicenter panel suggests either of the following regimens for hydroxychloroquine in children [59]:-13 mg/kg (maximum: 800 mg) orally, followed by 6.5 mg/kg (maximum: 400 mg) at 6, 24, and 48 hours after the initial dose (the duration can be extended for up to five days on a case-by-case basis)-6.5 mg/kg per dose (maximum: 400 mg per dose) orally twice per day on day 1, followed by 3.25 mg/kg (maximum: 200 mg/dose) orally twice per day for up to five daysHydroxychloroquine is thought to alter endosomal and lysosomal pH, inhibiting viral replication and propagation, although the exact mechanism of antiviral activity remains uncertain [99]. In the United States, the FDA has issued an emergency use authorization to allow the use of these agents in adolescents or adults hospitalized for COVID-19 when participation in clinical trials is not feasible [100].Clinical studies of hydroxychloroquine have been limited by small sample size and have included predominantly adult patients. They are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine'.)Given the uncertain efficacy and potential cardiac toxicity, we avoid chloroquine and the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 in children [101].•Lopinavir-ritonavir – We do not recommend routine use of lopinavir-ritonavir given the absence of efficacy and unfavorable pharmacodynamics [90].Adjunctive therapy — We make decisions about the use of adjunctive therapies for immune-mediated complications of COVID-19 on a case-by-case basis according to disease severity. We do not routinely use immune modulators (eg, glucocorticoids, IL-6 inhibitors [eg, tocilizumab], interferon-beta 1b, convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients) in the treatment of children with COVID-19, except in the context of a clinical trial. The benefits and risks are uncertain [102].Although there is no available data on the use of vitamin A for the treatment of COVID-19, vitamin A has long been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of measles, and its use has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality from measles-associated pneumonia [103]. Vitamin A deficiency may be associated with impairment of humoral and cell-mediated immunity, and even mild vitamin A deficiency may lead to increased morbidity from measles and other viral respiratory infections [103]. (See ""Measles: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention"", section on 'Vitamin A'.)Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from ClinicalTrials.gov. Outpatient management of children with COVID-19Telephone triage for children — The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides guidance for telephone triage of children with possible COVID-19. How should children be managed at home? — Children with documented or suspected COVID-19 and mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, pharyngitis, other respiratory symptoms) generally should be managed at home unless they have a chronic condition that increases their risk of severe disease.Management is focused on prevention of transmission to others (ie, isolation), monitoring for clinical deterioration, and supportive care. Although the role of children in transmission is not clear [104], some evidence from a report of a cluster of cases in France suggests the possibility that children may not transmit SARS-CoV-2 as efficiently as other age groups, perhaps related to viral interference [105]. The CDC and World Health Organization provide additional guidance on what to do if you (or your child) is sick [106,107]. (See 'Prevention of transmission' below.)●Monitoring for clinical deterioration – Caregivers of children who are managed at home should be counseled about symptoms of clinical deterioration, which may occur suddenly after approximately one week of symptoms and should prompt urgent re-evaluation [83]. These include [106-109]:•Severe respiratory distress, difficulty breathing (for infants: grunting, central cyanosis, inability to breastfeed)•Chest pain or pressure•Blue lips or face•Findings associated with shock (eg, cold, clammy, mottled skin; new confusion; difficulty arousing; substantially reduced urine output)●Symptomatic and supportive care – Symptomatic care for COVID-19 in the outpatient setting is similar to that for other upper respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical syndromes:•Upper respiratory tract infection (see ""The common cold in children: Management and prevention"", section on 'Symptomatic therapy') •Pharyngitis (see ""Acute pharyngitis in children and adolescents: Symptomatic treatment"", section on 'Symptomatic treatment')•Acute gastroenteritis (see ""Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Management and prevention"", section on 'Management')The management of fever in children, including indications for treatment, are discussed separately. (See ""Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management"", section on 'Management of fever'.)When can home isolation be discontinued? — The optimal duration of home isolation is uncertain. How long a person remains infectious is uncertain. The duration of viral shedding is variable; there appears to be a wide range, which may depend on severity of illness. Among 110 children at Wuhan Children's Hospital, the median duration of viral shedding was 15 days from onset of illness (interquartile range 11 to 20 days); the duration was longer for symptomatic than asymptomatic children (17 versus 11 days) [110]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.)The CDC has issued recommendations on discontinuation of home isolation, which include both test-based and nontest-based strategies [111-113]. The choice of strategy depends upon the patient population (eg, immunocompromised versus nonimmunocompromised), the availability of testing supplies, and access to testing.Avoidance of unproven interventions — Hydroxychloroquine and other investigational agents should be used only under the supervision of a health care provider, as described above; misuse of nonpharmaceutical forms of the investigational agents (eg, chloroquine phosphate, which is used in home aquariums; ivermectin intended for animals) may lead to severe toxicity, including death [98,114,115]. (See 'Inpatient management of children with COVID-19' above.)PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSIONFrom infected mother to newborn — Prevention of transmission from infected mother to newborn after delivery is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Postpartum care'.)From children with documented or suspected COVID-19During cardiopulmonary resuscitation — Modifications to algorithms for pediatric basic and advanced life support to prevent transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are discussed separately. (See ""Pediatric basic life support for health care providers"", section on 'COVID-19 patients (suspected or confirmed)' and ""Pediatric advanced life support (PALS)"", section on 'COVID-19 patients (suspected or confirmed)'.)Hygiene and social distancing — Prevention of transmission focuses on hygiene and social distancing. This includes [106,107,116]:●Having friends or family members bring necessary items to the home (to be retrieved outside).●Having the child (and other sick family members) wear a mask if leaving the home cannot be avoided. At the time of discharge, if supplies allow, providing patients with a pair of gloves and several masks may help to prevent transmission to household contacts. In addition, for patients without access to private transportation, arranging medical transportation, if possible, is preferable to the use of public transportation or ride-sharing services to minimize exposure to the public. ●As much as possible, keeping ill family members ≥6 feet away from other people, especially family members who are ≥65 years of age or have serious medical conditions.If such separation is not possible, have the ill family member wear a face mask when they are in the same room or vehicle as other people.●Keeping ill family members separated from pets in the household.●Having family members who have fever or cough sleep in separate rooms and use separate bathrooms.●Avoiding sharing items (eg, pillows, blankets, utensils, cups).Additional information about how to care for people with documented, suspected, or possible COVID-19 at home is available from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization [106,107].Disinfection — Disinfection of frequently touched surfaces is also important, as discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Environmental disinfection'.)For asymptomatic childrenShould routine health supervision appointments be rescheduled? — During the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefits of well-visits should be balanced with the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and other communicable illnesses, within the context of patient population and office environment [117-119]. When clinicians or practices are unable to provide well-child visits to all of the patients in their practice, the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) encourage prioritization of newborn care and vaccination of children through 24 months of age [119,120]. Disruption of immunization services increases the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses [121]. Adherence to recommendations for infants born to women who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or whose HBsAg status is unknown is particularly important for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus, especially if the delivery occurs at an unplanned facility or is attended by staff who are not knowledgeable about managing infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive [122]. (See ""Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview"", section on 'Benefits of vaccines' and ""Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents"", section on 'Routine infant immunization'.)Scheduling home visits, telemedicine, office space, and/or office locations can be used to keep well children and children who are ill or possibly ill separated (eg, scheduling well-visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon, seeing children for sick visits in a different part of the clinic, designated examination rooms, or at a different office site [or practice] than children for well-visits) [117,123-125].The AAP provides information and resources about telemedicine, including information about state-by-state payer policies.Use of cloth face masks — The CDC recommends that individuals ≥2 years of age wear a cloth face covering (eg, homemade masks or bandanas) when they are in public settings where social distancing may be difficult to achieve (eg, grocery stores, clinician offices), especially in areas with substantial community transmission [126]. Cloth masks are not recommended for children <2 years of age, because of concerns about suffocation [127]. The AAP provides additional information about cloth masks for children, including tips for increasing proper wearing and use. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Personal preventive measures'.)Should play dates and playgrounds be avoided? — Given the possibility of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from asymptomatic individuals (or presymptomatic individuals within the incubation period) [6,45,128-135], the CDC recommends that children not have play dates with children from other households and that when playing outside, they remain ≥6 feet from people from other households [136]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.)The CDC provides information about how to safely remain physically active at parks and recreational facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.Hand sanitizer safety — Although washing hands with soap and water, when available, is preferred for hand hygiene, alcohol-based hand sanitizer is safe for use in children when the sanitizer is used according to the information on the Drug Facts label; there is no cause for concern if children eat or lick their hands after the hand sanitizer has fully dried [137]. However, because ingestion of even a small amount of liquid hand sanitizer can cause alcohol poisoning in children (including hypoglycemia), children younger than six years should be supervised when using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be kept out of the reach and sight of children [138]. (See ""Ethanol intoxication in children: Epidemiology, estimation of toxicity, and toxic effects"" and ""Ethanol intoxication in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and management"".)SPECIAL POPULATIONSChildren with asthma — Considerations related to COVID-19 in children with asthma include the safety of glucocorticoid and nebulized medications. These considerations are discussed separately. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic'.)Children with special health care needs — The American Academy of Pediatrics provides information about how to keep children with special health care needs safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — The European attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guidelines group provides guidance for management of ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance for starting stimulants or atomoxetine in children who did not have an in-person cardiovascular assessment before the pandemic [139,140].OTHER ISSUES●What type of infant formula can be substituted if the usual formula is not available? – The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) provides advice for providers and families if infant formula is not available.●What are the effects of prolonged home confinement? – Although prolonged home confinement may provide an opportunity to enhance parent-child relationships, it may adversely affect children's physical and mental health [141-150]. They may be less physically active, spend more time with electronic devices, and eat a poorer quality diet. Mental health stressors include fear of infection, boredom, and social isolation. In a survey of primary school students from Hubei province in China after being restricted to home for a mean of 35 days, the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety (approximately 20 percent for each) was greater than that in other surveys [148]. School closures related to health emergencies have been associated with increased risk of violence and vulnerability [144,151]. Vulnerable children and adolescents (eg, those who are homeless or in foster care, have a history of maltreatment, are sexual or gender minorities) are at particular risk for violence and adverse mental health effects [149]. Adverse mental and physical health effects can be mitigated and parent-child relations enhanced through parental role-modeling of healthy behaviors, involving children in family activities, promotion of self-discipline and self-sufficiency skills, and having direct, developmentally appropriate conversations with children about the pandemic [141,146,152-154].Clinicians should consider the potential for violence and look for signs of parental stress, irritability, depression, and/or harsh responses to child behaviors during each clinical encounter [151]. They should ask about parent stress levels, methods to manage stress, social supports, and substance use. Clinicians can offer coping strategies (eg, deep breathing, calling a friend or family member), resources, and/or referrals to mental health providers to families who may benefit from these interventions. •Resources related to child care and prevention of violence during the COVID-19 pandemic include:-Child Care Aware of America-Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children-The National Child Traumatic Stress Network•Resources for talking with children about COVID-19 are available from multiple professional groups and others, including:-The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry-The AAP: Talking to children about COVID-19-Coronavirus: A book for children (written by Elizabeth Jenner, Kate Wilson, and Nia Roberts; illustrated by Axel Scheffler)-COVIBOOK for children younger than seven years-The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-The National Association of School Psychologists-The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Inter-Agency Standing Committee (a children's book for children approximately 6 to 11 years of age)●What resources are available for home schooling children and keeping them occupied during the pandemic? – Several national organizations provide educational resources for children, including, among others [123,144]:•AAP:-Working and learning from home during the COVID-19 outbreak-Getting children outside while social distancing for COVID-19-Teens and COVID-19: Challenges and opportunities during the outbreak•National Association for the Education of Young Children•National Head Start Association Resources for Parents•Opening Doors/Abriendo Puertas•Sesame Workshop•United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)•The World Health Organization•Zero to ThreeSOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or email these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient education"" and the keyword[s] of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (See 'Introduction' above.)●Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less frequently than adults. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●COVID-19 in children is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported, including cases with clinical features similar to toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease (table 1). In case series of children with COVID-19, the most common symptoms in children are fever and cough. Other symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, diarrhea, and vomiting. Additional symptoms that have been reported in adults include chills or shaking chills, myalgia, headache, and new loss of taste or smell. Laboratory findings are often normal but may include leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and elevated procalcitonin or C-reactive protein. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)●Criteria for testing for COVID-19 vary geographically. In the United States, guidance provided by the CDC and Infectious Diseases Society of America (table 2) may be adapted by state and local health departments depending upon test availability. (See 'What are the criteria for testing for COVID-19 in children?' above.)•Given limited testing resources, our institutions perform targeted testing in the outpatient setting. For children who are evaluated for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in the emergency department or urgent care setting, we perform testing for SARS-CoV-2 if the child has an underlying condition that may increase the risk for severe disease, known in-person exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 14 days, or presentation with severe illness. (See 'Outpatient testing criteria' above.)•We perform universal testing of hospitalized patients at the time of presentation, regardless of clinical symptoms or signs of COVID-19; infants born in the institution to a mother who tested negative for COVID-19 and are admitted to the nursery or neonatal intensive care unit are an exception. (See 'Inpatient testing criteria' above.) ●Children with COVID-19 and severe or critical lower respiratory tract disease generally require hospital admission. Severe disease is defined by a new requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline without new or increased need for ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive). Critical disease is defined by new or increased need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, sepsis, multiorgan failure, or rapidly worsening clinical trajectory. (See 'Assessment of severity' above.)●Supportive care (eg, respiratory support, fluid and electrolyte support, monitoring for cytokine release syndrome) is the mainstay of therapy for children with severe or critical COVID-19. (See 'Supportive care for all patients' above.)●We agree with recommendations from the multicenter initial guidance on the use of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 and other experts that antiviral therapy for COVID-19 should occur in the context of a clinical trial. (See 'Antiviral therapy for select patients' above.)•Decisions regarding antiviral therapy should be individualized according to disease severity, clinical trajectory, and underlying conditions that may increase the risk for progression.•When a decision is made to use antiviral therapy, we prefer remdesivir to other agents. Hydroxychloroquine (without azithromycin) is an alternative for children who are not candidates for remdesivir or if remdesivir is unavailable. ●Children with documented or suspected COVID-19 and mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, pharyngitis, other respiratory symptoms) generally should be managed at home unless they have a chronic condition that increases their risk of severe disease. Management is focused on prevention of transmission to others (ie, isolation), monitoring for clinical deterioration (eg, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, symptoms of shock), and supportive care. (See 'How should children be managed at home?' above.)●Symptomatic care for COVID-19 in the outpatient setting is similar to that for other upper respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical syndromes. It is discussed separately.

The disease is associated with multiple psychiatric problems in clinicians who care for patients with COVID-19 or suspected illness [2,3]. In addition, COVID-19 may precipitate anxiety, depression, and sleep problems in patients with COVID-19 and may adversely affect patients with established psychiatric disorders. This topic addresses the epidemiology, clinical features, course of illness, and management of psychiatric issues that are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Other topics discuss COVID-19 per se and related issues arising in different specialties, such as cardiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and oncology.EPIDEMIOLOGY — A limited number of studies describe the prevalence of mental health sequelae associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Health care workers — Psychiatric symptoms and disorders can occur in clinicians exposed to COVID-19 [3]. As an example, one cross-sectional study used self-report instruments to assess hospital-based physicians and nurses (total n >1200) in China from January 29 to February 3, 2020 [2]. The prevalence of moderate to severe psychiatric symptoms was as follows:●Anxiety – 12 percent●Depression – 15 percent●Insomnia – 8 percent●Traumatic distress – 35 percentIn addition, roughly one-quarter to one-third of clinicians had mild symptoms. Another cross-sectional study assessed nearly 300 hospital-based physicians and nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in Singapore from February 19 to March 13, 2020, using self-report screening instruments [4]. Relatively few clinicians screened positive for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; approximately 5 to 10 percent), which the authors attributed to better preparedness of the clinicians based upon their previous experience with the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic.Risk factors and protective factors — A review of 59 studies of viral outbreaks such as the SARS epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic identified multiple risk factors and protective factors for psychiatric problems in health care workers [5]:●Risk factors – The most consistent risk factor across studies was increased contact with affected patients. Other consistent predictors were a prior history of psychiatric symptoms/disorders and/or general medical illnesses, spending a prolonged time in quarantine, perceived lack of organizational support, and perceived social stigma directed towards health care workers. ●Protective factors – Across studies, the factor that most consistently decreased the risk of adverse psychological outcomes in health care workers was access to personal protective equipment. Other consistent protective factors included having supportive peers, access to psychiatric interventions, and trust in the institution’s infection control measures, as well as receiving clear communication from supervisors and adequate time off from work. Patients with COVID-19 — Few data are available regarding psychiatric problems in patients with COVID-19. However, based upon studies conducted during the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong, we anticipate that many patients with COVID-19 will develop anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, PTSD, and substance use disorders [6,7]. As an example, at the peak of the 2003 epidemic, a prospective study enrolled 79 patients with SARS, including 30 infected health care workers (primarily nurses), and 145 healthy controls [8]. Self-reported stress was greater among the infected patients than controls, as were negative psychological effects such as dysphoria, impaired sleep, poor concentration, and impaired judgment. However, most patients and controls also reported positive psychological effects such as awareness of hygiene, physical state, and current affairs. In addition, COVID-19 appears to affect central nervous system function, which may indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are likely to occur in some patients. (See 'Pathogenesis' below.) Patients with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses — It appears that the psychological effects of COVID-19 are adversely affecting many patients with pre-existing mental disorders (ie, onset of the disorder occurred prior to the pandemic). As an example, approximately 20 to 25 percent think they are coping poorly and deteriorating:●A self-report, online survey of outpatients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders (n >1400), which was conducted in China from February to March 2020, found that deterioration related to the pandemic was reported by 21 percent [9]. Mental health problems included anxiety, depression, and insomnia, which were attributed to fear of infection, restrictions on transportation, and isolating at home.●In a self-report, online survey of individuals who self-identified as having a mental illness such as an anxiety disorder, unipolar major depression, or bipolar disorder (total n = 193), approximately twice as many were coping poorly compared with coping well (23 and 12 percent) [10]. The majority had specific concerns about the pandemic and their mental health, such as worsening of their illness (64 percent), inability to receive treatment (39 percent), and running out of medication (38 percent). Patients with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and individuals who are homeless are especially likely to suffer from the pandemic, being at risk not only for COVID-19 based upon their social circumstances, but also more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses that put them at risk for poorer health outcomes once infected [11,12]. In addition, their cognitive difficulties and marginalized social status may impair their ability to follow public health prescriptions intended to minimize spread of the infection.General population — The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, distress, and PTSD in the general population of adults and children, as described in the studies immediately below. However, it is not clear that the prevalence of adverse psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic exceeds the baseline prevalence:●A cross-sectional study of adults (n = 1060) in January and February 2020, using a self-report measure, found that clinically significant psychological distress was present in 12 percent [13]. Distress was greater in those who were aged 50 years and older, were divorced or widowed, and employed as health care workers.●A cross-sectional, self-report internet survey of adults (n = 285) in February 2020 found that clinically significant symptoms of PTSD (intrusion symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in mood and cognition, plus hyperarousal) were present in 7 percent [14]. Women and individuals with sleep problems reported more symptoms of PTSD.●Chinese students in grades 2 through 6, who were quarantined at home for an average of 34 days, completed a cross-sectional, online, self-report survey in February and March 2020 [15]. Anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were each reported by roughly 20 percent and almost two-thirds were worried about becoming infected. Older individuals (eg, ≥70 years), immunocompromised patients, and patients with chronic disease may also experience increased anxiety, depression, and worry [16,17]. PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms and disorders that arise during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may include biologic and psychosocial factors.COVID-19 may directly affect central nervous system function: ●A retrospective chart review of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 214) found that central nervous system manifestations (eg, dizziness, headache, or impaired consciousness) occurred in 25 percent [18]. ●A retrospective study of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19 (n = 58) found multiple neurologic and psychiatric features, such as agitation (69 percent), confusion (65 percent), and corticospinal tract signs (67 percent) [19]. At the time of discharge, one-third of patients had impaired neuropsychologic function, including inattention, disorientation, or poorly organized movements to command. However, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in seven patients was negative for the virus, suggesting that the neurologic findings may have resulted from encephalopathy secondary to critical illness, cytokines, or medications, rather than the direct effect of viral infection. These findings are consistent with a literature review that found past viral epidemics were associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as demyelination, encephalopathy, and neuromuscular dysfunction, as well as mood changes and psychosis [20]. The symptoms occurred during infection or following recovery from the infection in the ensuing weeks, months, or longer. Immunologic findings in patients with COVID-19 include elevated serum C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-6) and decreased total blood lymphocyte counts [20].Critical illness and resultant intensive care unit stays commonly expose patients to extreme physiological and psychological stressors that are life-threatening and frequently precipitate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The estimated of rate of PTSD in these settings varies widely, but least-biased study estimates suggest a rate of 25 to 45 percent [21].In addition, psychiatric illnesses that occur during the pandemic may stem from psychosocial factors such as [3,6,16,22,23]:●Frequency and extent of exposure to individuals infected with the virus●Fear of infecting family members●Lack of access to testing and medical care for COVID-19●Physical distancing, home confinement, and quarantining●Inconsistent messages and directives regarding public health measures such as wearing face masks●Increased workloads●Economic hardships and insecurity●Shortages of available resources (eg, foods, paper products, and personal protective equipment)●Diminished personal freedoms●Continuous media reporting about the pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding its eventual outcomeAmong outpatients with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses (ie, onset prior to the pandemic), deterioration may occur because routine visits with clinicians are not available [9]. Consequently, patients who are unable to obtain refills may be forced to reduce the dose of their medications or stop them altogether, and some patients may not have the opportunity to adjust the dose or switch medications if they are ineffective or causing adverse effects.CLINICAL FEATURES — The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may give rise to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Overview — The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with psychiatric symptoms that do not necessarily rise to the level of a psychiatric disorder, based upon studies of previous epidemics. As an example, a review of 24 studies examined the psychological impact of quarantine in 10 countries during infectious disease outbreaks such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory system epidemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak [23]. Adverse psychological outcomes included anger, anxiety, boredom, confusion, fear, depression, emotional exhaustion, frustration, irritability, and stress. Other adverse outcomes include avoidance behaviors (eg, avoiding crowded or public places), detachment from others, subthreshold symptoms of alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, excessive preoccupation with distressing somatic symptoms, and stigma, as well as domestic violence and suicidal ideation and behavior [16,23].The COVID-19 pandemic may also lead to full-blown anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder; these disorders are discussed separately: ●(See ""Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●(See ""Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●(See ""Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features"".)●(See ""Evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia in adults"", section on 'Clinical features'.)●(See ""Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, based upon studies that found previous viral epidemics were associated with increased rates of suicide deaths [24], including suicides that were reported as an adverse effect of quarantine [25]. Suicidality related to COVID-19 may be due to the hardships imposed by the pandemic, including economic privation, social isolation, reduced access to general medical and mental health care, and the stigma of having COVID-19 [9,16,22,24]. Health care workers — Studies of emerging viral outbreaks suggest that psychiatric symptoms and disorders are more likely to occur in health care workers who are at relatively high risk of exposure, compared with workers who are at low risk of exposure. As an example, a meta-analysis identified 25 studies (sample size not reported) of viral epidemics that examined psychiatric problems in health care workers who had direct contact with affected patients and health care workers who had little or no contact (controls) [5]. The analysis included 16 studies of the 2003 severe acute respiratory system epidemic and 5 of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary findings included the following:●Clinically significant psychological stress was more likely to occur in health care workers exposed to the virus than controls (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.0).●Clinically significant acute and/or posttraumatic distress was more likely to occur in workers exposed to the virus than controls (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.3).COURSE OF ILLNESS — Psychiatric problems related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may persist for at least three years beyond the pandemic, based upon retrospective studies of the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic. In these studies, individuals who were exposed to or survived SARS infection were assessed 2.5 to 3 years after the epidemic; moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were still present in roughly 20 to 30 percent. The risk for persistent psychiatric symptoms and disorders was higher in health care workers and individuals who were quarantined:●One year after the SARS epidemic, a study enrolled 96 individuals who survived SARS infection (including 33 health care workers) and 112 healthy controls [26]. Self-reported stress was greater among the SARS survivors than controls, and greater among health care worker SARS survivors than non-health care worker survivors. In addition, moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were present in approximately 33 percent of all survivors; anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were greater in females than males, and greater in health care worker SARS survivors than non-health care worker survivors.●In a study of hospital employees (n = 549) who were exposed to the SARS epidemic in Beijing, self-report assessments three years later indicated that moderate to severe depressive symptoms were present in 23 percent [27]. Perceived risk related to SARS during the epidemic and quarantining during the epidemic were each associated with higher levels of depression at follow-up.In addition, the assessments three years later found that among the 549 health care workers, at least one symptom of alcohol use disorder was present in approximately 19 percent [28]. Working in high risk locations (eg, SARS wards) during the epidemic and quarantining during the epidemic were each associated with symptoms of alcohol use disorder. ●A study interviewed 90 survivors of SARS infection approximately 2.5 years after hospitalization for the illness; a history of psychiatric disorders prior to infection was present in 7 percent [29]. At 2.5 years post-SARS, at least one psychiatric disorder was present in 33 percent of the survivors, including PTSD in 26 percent and depressive disorders in 16 percent. In addition, social and role functioning were each impaired in survivors.   ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS — Assessment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder are discussed separately: ●(See ""Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia in adults"".)●(See ""Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)Individuals with moderate to severe distress, anxiety, or depression should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behavior; one can use a screening tool or directly ask. (See ""Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"", section on 'Screening'.)MANAGEMENT — Psychiatric issues related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can occur in multiple populations, including clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 or suspected illness, patients with COVID-19, and patients with established psychiatric disorders prior to COVID-19. In addition, family members of clinicians and patients may develop psychiatric symptoms or disorders. General approach — For individuals who experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic, stepped care may be an efficacious and cost-effective approach to treatment [30]. According to this approach, monitoring mental health problems is paramount. Surveillance for domestic violence and child abuse, both of which are predicted to increase during mandated stay-at-home orders, is also critical [30]. Individuals with low levels of symptoms are provided with self-help materials pertinent to their symptoms and concerns and are eligible to speak with a mental health professional if they have additional or persistent concerns [9]. Other interventions that may help individuals cope with mild psychiatric symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic include limiting one’s intake of print and broadcast news about the pandemic, as well as maintaining routines and structured activities such as exercise, and staying connected to family and friends via phone and computer [16]. Health care workers in particular are likely to benefit from private, on-demand access to mental health professionals who can address sources of anxiety, distress, and other emotions related to caring for patients [5,31,32]. Individuals with moderate to severe symptoms can be treated by their primary care provider or referred to a mental health specialist.If feasible, psychiatric care should be administered by computer or telephone rather than face-to-face [9,11,33]. Patient contact through voice or voice plus video may be superior to text messages and emails [6]. Evidence supporting the use of remote care includes a small study of outpatient psychiatrists (n = 20) in the United States who transitioned to telemedicine with video visits and/or phone visits in March 2020 and were interviewed the following month [34]. The study found that the transition was relatively positive for both patients and clinicians. Patient preference usually dictated whether visits were conducted by video or phone. Advantages of telepsychiatry included improved access for patients, patients feeling more relaxed and thus being more forthcoming, and the opportunity to see the patient’s home. Disadvantages included difficulty observing nonverbal patient cues and hearing patients, technical disruptions such as frozen screens, as well as patients lacking privacy and problems with distractions. Techniques that improved the visits included starting each visit by asking whether patients had enough privacy; if not, suggestions were offered such as using the car or rescheduling the visit. For video visits, the psychiatrists suggested using the same place in the office or home to provide consistency and reassurance for patients.In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration offered guidance on April 14, 2020 regarding the COVID-19 public health emergency and use of digital health devices that pose a low risk for treating psychiatric disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia disorder, PTSD, and unipolar major depression [35]. The guidelines recommend that the devices be used only as adjunctive treatment. Functions that these devices may perform include reminders about physical activities, mindfulness activities, and behavioral techniques that patients can use when experiencing increased anxiety.   When face-to-face visits are necessary, personal protective equipment (eg, masks) should be used and care should ideally be administered to individuals rather than groups. In-person visits with masks may be experienced as less personal and leave patients feeling less connected to the clinician, compared with voice plus video meetings.Psychiatrists may be asked to consult on patients receiving pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 and should therefore be familiar with some of the medications currently being used. As an example, hydroxychloroquine, which is an antimalarial drug that is used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients (and undergoing clinical trials), is associated with psychiatric side effects such as mood and anxiety disturbances, insomnia, and more rarely, psychosis. Patients should be asked about any other prescribed medications or supplements they may be taking in the belief they might reduce vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Specific interactions of psychiatric medications with other medications may be determined using the Lexicomp drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. Specific medications that are being evaluated for COVID-19 are described separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Specific treatments'.)Physical distancing, which is widely encouraged to decelerate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within the general public and “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 cases, will result in loneliness for some individuals, particularly those living alone, including the elderly. This is likely to exacerbate the high rates of loneliness already experienced by the elderly, especially those who rely on social services rather than family for human contact and connection [17]. Digital technology may serve as a bridge for social connections and should be encouraged [6,36]. However, many individuals may lack access or the ability to take advantage of this.One resource that provides examples of how one can respond to patients or family members with different concerns or reactions is the COVID Ready Communication Playbook. This document guides clinicians on a range of topics specific to COVID-19, including helping patients and family members cope with a dire situation, as well as how clinicians can manage their own emotions.Family members of COVID-19 patients — In the context of physical distancing, most inpatient facilities have restricted or suspended visits by families and friends [37]. Family members of a loved one who is severely ill or dying will respond with grief. The treatment team should ask the family about thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to their loss, as well as provide grief counseling as warranted. (See ""Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features"" and ""Grief and bereavement in adults: Management"".)  Clinicians, patients with COVID-19, and their family should discuss end-of-life issues early in the course of management, especially if patients are elderly and suffering comorbidities. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'End of life issues'.) Health care workers — Health care workers who directly treat patients with COVID-19 are at risk for psychiatric symptoms and disorders (see 'Health care workers' above). In treating these problems, mental health professionals should address potential sources of anxiety and distress, including [5,24,31,32]:  ●Access to personal protective equipment●High transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and risk of self-exposure and infection●Risk of exposing family members and others to infection●Access to testing for oneself and family members●Enforcement of infection control procedures in the workplace●Access to up-to-date, accurate information about COVID-19●Unclear communication from supervisors●Access to childcare during school closures●Increased and taxing workloads●Moral dilemmas and moral injury arising from situations such as deciding how to allocate insufficient resources, inadvertently placing others in danger, and implementing clinical decisions by others that one thinks are contrary to best practices●Loss of control/vulnerability ●Availability and use of support from colleagues and managers●Dying patients and grief-stricken family membersBased upon a study of clinicians (n = 466) in public hospital emergency departments in Hong Kong during the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic [38], the most frequent coping strategies included accepting the reality of the stressor, taking action to circumvent the stressor, and viewing the situation in a more positive light and attempting to grow from the situation.A follow-up study of hospital employees who were exposed to the 2003 SARS epidemic in Beijing (n = 549) found that higher levels of altruistic acceptance of risk during the outbreak (eg, “I want to help the patients and accept the risk”) were associated with lower levels of self-reported depressive symptoms three years later [27]. Quarantine — A review of 24 studies that examined the adverse psychological impact of quarantine suggested the following steps to mitigate the negative effects [23]: ●Explain the purpose of quarantine and how to implement it.●Voluntary quarantine is associated with less distress than mandatory quarantine.●Emphasize the altruistic benefit of quarantine in keeping others safe.●Facilitate acquisition of general (eg, food and housing) and medical supplies (eg, prescriptions, thermometers, and face masks).Suicidality — Interventions for managing suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) include the following [24]:●Treatments specific for suicidality (see ""Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"", section on 'Management')●Treating underlying psychiatric disorders by telehealth or in-person, depending upon the severity of suicidality●Encouraging patients to maintain social contact by telephone or computer, as well as face-to-face encounters that maintain physical distancing●Referring patients to social work for help in accessing financial safety nets (eg, food, housing, unemployment support, and loans)Specific disorders — Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia disorder, and PTSD that are associated with COVID-19 should follow recommendations for treating the general population of patients with these disorders and are discussed separately: ●(See ""Approach to treating generalized anxiety disorder in adults"".)●(See ""Approach to treating panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults"".)●(See ""Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"".)●(See ""Overview of the treatment of insomnia in adults"".)●(See ""Approach to treating posttraumatic stress disorder in adults"".)Schizophrenia — Pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for acute symptoms of schizophrenia that are associated with COVID-19 should follow recommendations for treating the general population of patients with schizophrenia and are discussed separately. (See ""Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Acute and maintenance phase treatment"" and ""Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia"".)Home visits — For patients with schizophrenia who are acutely ill with mild to moderate symptoms, daily home visits by clinicians and 24-hour coverage may be a reasonable alternative to inpatient hospitalization [33,39]. This allows patients to maintain physical distancing and home confinement, and thus avoid exposure to COVID-19. For patients with schizophrenia who are stable, home visits may be suitable to promote adherence to treatment and prevent relapse.Clozapine bloodwork — Patients receiving clozapine for schizophrenia or other serious mental illness typically require blood tests every one to four weeks to monitor absolute neutrophil counts. However, patients and clinicians need to decide whether the risks of COVID-19 outweigh the benefits of obtaining blood work. (See ""Guidelines for prescribing clozapine in schizophrenia"", section on 'Required bloodwork and coronavirus disease 2019'.)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.●General guidance from public health authorities (eg, World Health Organization or United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) – (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)●More detailed guidance for specialty care, including psychiatry – (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Psychiatry'.) ●Resources for psychiatric patients and their families – (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".) INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, “The Basics” and “Beyond the Basics.” The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on “patient info” and the keyword(s) of interest.) ●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")Patient education material is also available through the United States National Institute of Mental Health and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.SUMMARY●In one study from China, clinicians treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) developed moderate to severe psychiatric symptoms, including:•Anxiety – 12 percent•Depression – 15 percent•Insomnia – 8 percent•Distress – 35 percent(See 'Health care workers' above.)●The pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms and disorders that arise during the COVID-19 pandemic may include biologic and psychosocial factors. (See 'Pathogenesis' above.)●The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with psychiatric symptoms that do not necessarily rise to the level of a psychiatric disorder. In addition, the pandemic may lead to full-blown psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). During viral epidemics, psychiatric symptoms and disorders are more likely to occur in health care workers who are at relatively high risk of exposure, compared with workers who are at low risk of exposure. (See 'Clinical features' above.) ●Psychiatric problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic may persist for at least three years beyond the pandemic. In studies of a prior epidemic that assessed individuals 2.5 to 3 years after the epidemic, moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and PTSD were present in roughly 20 to 30 percent of individuals. In addition, the risk for persistent psychiatric symptoms and disorders was higher in health care workers and individuals who quarantined. (See 'Course of illness' above.) ●For individuals who experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or PTSD, stepped care may be an efficacious and cost-effective approach; surveillance of mental health problems is paramount.

Practice Changing UpDates focus on changes that may have significant and broad impact on practice, and therefore do not represent all updates that affect practice. These Practice Changing UpDates, reflecting important changes to UpToDate over the past year, are presented chronologically, and are discussed in greater detail in the identified topic reviews.INFECTIOUS DISEASES (May 2020)Remdesivir in COVID-19●For hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, we recommend remdesivir, if available (Grade 1C).Remdesivir is an investigational antiviral agent under evaluation for COVID-19. Emerging data from randomized trials are limited and mixed. Interim analysis of an unpublished trial of >1000 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement suggested that remdesivir resulted in faster time to recovery (median 11 versus 15 days with placebo); a trend towards lower mortality was not statistically significant (8 versus 11.6 percent) [1]. In contrast, in a randomized trial from China of 237 patients with severe COVID-19, remdesivir and placebo had similar times to clinical improvement (median 21 versus 23 days) and mortality rates (14 versus 13 percent); however, confidence in the finding of no effect was reduced by use of concomitant therapies, differences in baseline comorbidities between the groups, and failure to meet the target enrollment [2]. Overall, if the preliminary results of the larger trial are confirmed, remdesivir likely has some clinical benefit, although the patient population most likely to benefit is uncertain. The United States Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19; if available, we recommend remdesivir for such patients and also refer them for trials of other agents, if concurrent remdesivir use is allowed. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Remdesivir'.)INFECTIOUS DISEASES (March 2020, Modified April 2020)One-time HCV screening for all adults ≥18 years●We suggest one-time screening for hepatitis C virus infection in all adults aged ≥18 years rather than selective screening (Grade 2C).In April 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that all adults ≥18 years be screened at least once for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [3]. The CDC recommendations differ from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations issued in March 2020, which included an upper age limit of 79 years for universal screening [4]. Previously, screening was recommended only for patients who had certain risk factors or were born during certain decades, but this approach results in many missed diagnoses. The improved efficacy, tolerability, and accessibility of antiviral treatment for HCV also support a broader screening strategy. We agree with the new CDC recommendation for broad one-time screening in all adults, and we continue to suggest repeat screening in individuals with ongoing risk factors (algorithm 1). (See ""Screening and diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"", section on 'Routine one-time screening for adults'.)ONCOLOGY (March 2020)Hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiation for treatment of brain metastases●For most patients undergoing whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for treatment of brain metastases, we suggest use of hippocampal avoidance intensity-modulated radiotherapy rather than conventional WBRT (Grade 2C). Patients with metastases within 5 mm of the hippocampi should receive conventional WBRT.For patients receiving whole brain radiation (WBRT) for brain metastases, neurocognitive decline is a feared complication that adversely impacts quality of life. Lowering the dose of radiation delivered to the hippocampi with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been suggested as a way to improve neurocognitive outcomes compared with conventional WBRT. In a randomized, unblinded trial in over 500 patients with brain metastases, the use of hippocampal avoidance IMRT (HA-IMRT) led to a 26 percent relative reduction in the risk of cognitive toxicity compared with conventional WBRT [5]. Patients in the HA-IMRT group reported less difficulty remembering things, less difficulty speaking, and greater improvement in fatigue at six months. Rates of brain control and overall survival were similar between groups, although confidence intervals were wide. All patients also received memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that was shown to reduce the risk of neurotoxicity in a previous trial. Based on these results, we now suggest HA-IMRT rather than conventional WBRT in most patients who require WBRT for treatment of brain metastases, and we administer memantine concurrently. (See ""Delayed complications of cranial irradiation"", section on 'Prevention'.)HEMATOLOGY (February 2020)Less chemoimmunotherapy for limited stage diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL) with no adverse features●For patients with limited stage (stage I or II) diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL) with no adverse features, we suggest four cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) rather than six or more cycles of R-CHOP, radiation therapy (RT) alone, or combined modality therapy (R-CHOP plus RT) (Grade 2C).Limited stage (stage I or II) diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL) without adverse risk factors (ie, no bulky disease, normal lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ECOG performance status 0-1) has an excellent prognosis when treated with the current standard approaches of either six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or three cycles of R-CHOP followed by radiation therapy (RT). To determine if less chemoimmunotherapy could achieve comparable outcomes with less toxicity, almost 600 patients ≤60 years with stage I-II DLBCL and no adverse risk factors were randomly assigned to four versus six cycles of R-CHOP [6]. With median follow-up greater than five years, there was less hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity with four cycles of R-CHOP, while three-year progression-free survival (PFS) and estimated five-year PFS and overall survival were similar compared with six cycles. We now suggest four cycles of R-CHOP for treatment of adults of any age with limited stage DLBCL and no adverse features. (See ""Initial treatment of limited stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma"", section on 'No adverse features'.)NEUROLOGY (December 2019)Tranexamic acid for adults with acute traumatic brain injury●For patients with moderate traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale greater than 8 and less than 13) presenting within three hours of injury, we recommend immediate administration of tranexamic acid (Grade 1B).Whether the antifibrolytic agent tranexamic acid benefits patients with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) was previously uncertain. In the CRASH-3 trial, which included over 9000 adults presenting within three hours of TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <13 or any evidence of intracranial bleeding on CT scan, those receiving tranexamic acid had a nonsignificantly lower rate of death related to head injury compared with placebo (18.5 versus 19.8 percent) [7]. However, this difference was statistically significant when patients with unreactive pupils were excluded (11.5 versus 13.2 percent) and in the subgroup of patients with mild to moderate TBI (5.8 versus 7.5 percent). Adverse events were similar between groups, including the rate of vaso-occlusive events. Based on these results, we now recommend tranexamic acid in patients with moderate TBI presenting within three hours of injury. Tranexamic acid may also be reasonable in other patient groups, such as those with severe TBI and reactive pupils or those with mild TBI (GCS >12) and intracranial bleeding, but a benefit is less certain in these patients. (See ""Management of acute moderate and severe traumatic brain injury"", section on 'Antifibrinolytic therapy'.)PEDIATRICS (November 2019)Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor for cystic fibrosis caused by the F508del variant●For patients age ≥12 years old with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the F508del variant, we suggest a triple therapy regimen (elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor) rather than dual therapy (tezacaftor-ivacaftor or lumacaftor-ivacaftor) (Grade 2B). For patients ≥12 years who have one F508del variant(heterozygotes), we suggest the triple therapy regimen rather than dual therapy or monotherapy with ivacaftor (Grade 2C).Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor is a combination cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulator designed to improve production and function of the defective CFTR protein in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by the F508del CFTR variant. Two recent studies evaluated this combination drug in differing populations:•In a randomized trial in >100 patients homozygous for the F508del variant, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor increased FEV1 at four weeks and improved respiratory symptoms compared with dual therapy (tezacaftor-ivacaftor) [8].•In a separate placebo-controlled randomized trial in >400 patients age ≥12 years who were heterozygous for the F508del variant and had a second minimal function variant (ie, producing no CFTR protein or a protein unresponsive to ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor), elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor increased the FEV1 after four weeks of treatment, decreased pulmonary exacerbations by >60 percent, improved respiratory symptoms, and reduced sweat chloride [9].The studies were the basis for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of this combination drug for patients ≥12 years with the F508del variant (homozygotes or heterozygotes with 508del and any other disease-causing CFTR variant). We now recommend CFTR modulator therapy for most patients with CF and suggest triple therapy for patients with who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del CFTR variant, representing almost 90 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis in the United States. (See ""Cystic fibrosis: Treatment with CFTR modulators"", section on 'Efficacy'.) HEMATOLOGY (November 2019)Lenalidomide for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma●For patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, we recommend treatment with single-agent lenalidomide or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone rather than observation (Grade 1B).Until recently, standard of care for patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) has been observation with systemic treatment deferred until progression to symptomatic disease. An earlier randomized trial demonstrated improved outcomes with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd), but concerns with the study design made extrapolation of the results difficult. In a second multicenter randomized trial of 182 patients with SMM, single-agent lenalidomide improved progression-free survival (PFS) and decreased end organ damage (eg, renal failure, bone lesions) when compared with observation [10]. Serious (grade 3/4) adverse events occurred in 41 percent of patients in the treatment arm; there was one treatment-related death in the phase II run-in and none in the randomized phase. On subgroup analysis, the PFS benefit was definitive in those with high-risk SMM but less clear in those with intermediate-risk disease. For patients with high-risk SMM by the Mayo 2018 20/2/20 criteria, we now recommend treatment with single-agent lenalidomide or Rd rather than observation (algorithm 2). More intensive regimens, or treatment for lower-risk SMM, should be reserved for patients enrolled in clinical trials. (See ""Smoldering multiple myeloma"", section on 'Management of high-risk SMM'.)CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE (October 2019)Dapagliflozin for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction●For patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who have persistent symptoms and an elevated serum natriuretic peptide level on optimal pharmacologic and device therapy, we recommend addition of dapagliflozin (versus no additional drug therapy) (Grade 1B).Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), but whether they improve outcomes for nondiabetic patients with HF has not been known. The DAPA-HF trial evaluated the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in nearly 5000 patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and an elevated natriuretic peptide level on optimal drug and device therapy [11]. Compared with placebo, all-cause mortality and the primary composite outcome (worsening HF or cardiovascular death) was reduced with dapagliflozin, with similar effects in patients with and without type 2 DM. The frequency of adverse effects was generally similar in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups. Given these findings, we now recommend dapagliflozin for patients with HFrEF with persistent symptoms and an elevated serum natriuretic peptide level despite optimal drug and device therapy (including a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and/or cardiac resynchronization therapy, if indicated). Dapagliflozin is contraindicated in patients with symptomatic hypotension or systolic blood pressure <95 mmHg, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, or rapidly declining renal function. (See ""Secondary pharmacologic therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in adults"", section on 'Evidence'.)OBSTETRICS, GYNECOLOGY AND WOMEN'S HEALTH (August 2019)New ACOG guidelines for preventing early-onset group B streptococcus infection in newborns●Universal screening of pregnant women for Group B streptococcal (GBS) colonization is now recommended at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation, rather than the previously recommended 35 to 37 weeks. Women with GBS bacteriuria any time in pregnancy or who had an infant with early-onset GBS infection in a previous pregnancy can be excluded from culture-based screening as they should routinely receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has released guidelines for prevention of early-onset group B streptococcus (GBS) infection in newborns, updating and replacing the obstetric portions of the 2010 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [12]. Among the revisions, a GBS rectovaginal screening culture is now recommended at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation rather than at 35 to 37 weeks. Cultures obtained more than five weeks before delivery are not predictive of GBS status at the time of birth, and the later screening window decreases the number of women who need to be recultured if they have not delivered by their due date. In addition, in selected women with unknown GBS status and a history of GBS colonization in a previous pregnancy, clinicians may offer intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics as part of a shared decision-making process rather than basing the decision to initiate antibiotics on intrapartum risk factors or results of rapid testing. (See ""Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: Prevention"", section on 'Culture-based approach'.)INFECTIOUS DISEASES (June 2019)Screening of US health care workers for latent tuberculosis infection●In US regions with a low incidence rate of tuberculosis (TB), health care workers in facilities where the tuberculin skin test conversion rate is low need not undergo routine serial TB testing following a baseline TB test. However, routine serial TB testing may be reasonable for those with increased risk for occupational exposure to TB (eg, pulmonologists, respiratory therapists, emergency department personnel), and institutional policies should be individualized.Annual screening of health care workers (HCWs) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has been a longstanding practice in the United States for prevention of tuberculosis (TB) transmission; however, the national incidence of TB has declined steadily over the past several decades, there is no evidence that annual screening reduces TB incidence, and testing has a number of limitations. Based on these factors, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) issued new guidelines in May 2019 stating that, following baseline screening, health care workers should not undergo routine annual screening [13]. We agree with this guidance, which serves as an update to the prior 2005 guidelines (table 1). Annual screening may be reasonable for HCWs at increased risk for occupational TB exposure (such as pulmonologists or respiratory therapists) or for HCWs in certain settings (such as emergency departments). Institutional policies should be individualized to incorporate these factors.

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for ""coronavirus disease 2019"" [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Society guideline links'.)This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of arrhythmias and conduction system disease in patients with COVID-19. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of other cardiac presentations (eg, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, etc) and noncardiac symptoms of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere: ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The prevalence of arrhythmias and conduction system disease (and cardiovascular disease in general) in patients with COVID-19 varies from population to population. In most available reports, the specific cause of palpitations or type of arrhythmia have not been specified. Hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities, both known to contribute to the development of acute arrhythmias, have been frequently reported in the acute phase of severe COVID-19 illness; therefore, the exact contribution of COVID-19 infection to the development of arrhythmias in asymptomatic, mildly ill, critically ill, and recovered patients is not known [4]. ●In a multinational cohort of 8910 patients from Asia, Europe, and North America, 304 patients (3.4 percent) had a history of arrhythmia [5]. A history of arrhythmias was more than twice as common in patients who died from COVID-19 (6.8 versus 3.2 percent among survivors). ●In 137 subjects from Hubei province, 10 patients (7.3 percent) noted palpitations as one of the initial symptoms [6]. ●In a study of 138 patients from Wuhan who were hospitalized with COVID-19-related pneumonia, arrhythmias were reported in 17 percent of the general cohort and in 44 percent of patients admitted to an intensive care unit [7]. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSSigns and symptoms — Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. The most common clinical features reported at the onset of illness include fever (99 percent), fatigue (70 percent), dry cough (59 percent), anorexia (40 percent), myalgias (35 percent), dyspnea (31 percent), and sputum production (27 percent) [7]. Noncardiac manifestations of COVID-19 are discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of arrhythmias or conduction system disease. Patients may be tachycardic (with or without palpitations) in the setting of other illness-related symptoms (eg, fever, shortness of breath, pain, etc). The following observations have been reported from various cohorts:●In the cohort from Hubei province, 7.3 percent reported palpitations as a presenting symptom [6,8]. ●Among 4250 patients with COVID-19 from a multicenter New York cohort, 260 (6.1 percent) had QTc >500 milliseconds at the time of admission [9]. However, in another study of 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the baseline QTc was 435 milliseconds before taking these medications [10]. ●Among 393 patients with COVID-19 from a different New York cohort, atrial arrhythmias were more common among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (17.7 versus 1.9 percent) [11].●Among 187 patients with COVID-19 from a Chinese cohort, 11 patients (5.9 percent) had ventricular tachyarrhythmias while hospitalized [12]. ●Epidemiologic data from the Lombardi region of Italy show a nearly 60 percent increase in the rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the peak of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic (when compared with the same time frame from 2019) [13]. This could be related to COVID-19 infections, stress related to the pandemic, or delays in seeking medical attention by those with cardiac symptoms. It does not appear that there was increase in shockable rhythms, even in those who were suspected of or diagnosed with COVID-19. Other patients in whom arrhythmias may be seen include:●Patients who present with other cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection, such as myocardial injury or myocardial ischemia. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".) ●Patients with hypoxia, shock (septic or cardiogenic), or evidence of widespread systemic inflammation [14]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●Patients with electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypokalemia) that predispose to the development of arrhythmias. (See ""Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults"", section on 'Cardiac arrhythmias and ECG abnormalities' and ""Hypomagnesemia: Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion"", section on 'Cardiovascular'.)●Patients who are receiving QT-prolonging therapies and who may develop polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). (See 'Patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes)' below.) ●Patients with fever, which can unmask cases of cardiac channelopathies such as Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome [15,16]. (See 'Brugada syndrome' below and ""Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations"".)Cardiovascular testingECG — Most patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected, and in particular patients with severe disease or in whom QT-prolonging medications will be used, should have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the time of entry into the health care system [17]. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single- or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring or multiple lead positions from a hand-held ECG device may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient [18]. This will allow for documenting baseline QRS-T morphology should the patient develop signs/symptoms suggestive of myocardial injury or an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the baseline ECG allows for documentation of the QT (and corrected QTc) interval. Importantly, QTc will need to be monitored if QT-prolonging therapies are initiated (eg, azithromycin, chloroquine, etc) to reduce the risk of acquired LQTS. (See ""Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"" and 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' below.)Continuous ECG monitoring — In the absence of documented cardiac arrhythmias, suspected myocardial ischemia, or other standard indications, continuous ECG monitoring is not required. However, as part of infection control mechanisms for patients with established or suspected COVID-19 infection, many hospitals are utilizing continuous ECG monitoring (in conjunction with automated blood pressure readings and oxygen saturation monitors) in lieu of standard vital sign checks by nursing staff. This practice reduces the number of clinical staff interacting with the patient, thereby reducing the risk to health care workers and preserving personal protective equipment. Transthoracic echocardiography — While some patients may develop cardiac manifestations, including myocardial injury, an initial transthoracic echocardiogram is not necessary for all patients. Providers may consider using a point-of-care ultrasound for a focused exam. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)DIAGNOSIS OF ARRHYTHMIAS — Arrhythmias are most commonly diagnosed from a combination of vital signs and review of the ECG, ideally a 12-lead ECG, but a rhythm strip can also be used. Tachycardias present with a pulse greater than 100 beats per minute, while most bradyarrhythmias present with a pulse less than 50 to 60 beats per minute. ●The most common arrhythmia overall in patients with COVID-19 is sinus tachycardia, but the most likely pathologic arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and monomorphic or polymorphic VT.●The differentiation between various tachycardias based on regularity (ie, regular or irregular) and QRS width (ie, narrow or wide QRS complex) requires only a surface ECG. (See ""Narrow QRS complex tachycardias: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to the diagnosis"".)●Bradyarrhythmias, including sinus pauses or high-grade heart block with slow escape rhythms, have not typically been seen but can be identified using a surface ECG if present. (See ""Sinus node dysfunction: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II"" and ""Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block"".)The diagnosis of acquired LQTS can be made in a patient with sufficient QT prolongation on the surface ECG in association with a medication or other clinical scenario (ie, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) known to cause QT prolongation. Ideally, the diagnosis is made following review of a full 12-lead ECG, but sometimes a single-lead rhythm strip is adequate if a full 12-lead ECG cannot be obtained. Acquired QT prolongation is typically reversible upon removal of the underlying etiology, such as discontinuation of an offending medication or correction of electrolyte derangements. (See 'Management' below.)Overall, the average QTc in healthy persons after puberty is 420±20 milliseconds. In general, the 99th percentile QTc values are 470 milliseconds in postpubertal males and 480 milliseconds in postpubertal females [19]. A QTc >500 milliseconds is considered highly abnormal for both men and women.MANAGEMENTPatients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes) — All patients with torsades de pointes (TdP) should have an immediate assessment of the symptoms, vital signs, and level of consciousness to determine if they are hemodynamically stable or unstable. Unstable patients — Patients with sustained TdP usually become hemodynamically unstable, severely symptomatic, or pulseless and should be treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms [20], including cardioversion/defibrillation (algorithm 1). Initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, with the exception of intravenous (IV) magnesium, is not indicated for hemodynamically unstable or pulseless patients. A full discussion of the standard approaches to basic life support and advanced cardiac life support is presented separately. (See ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"" and ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"".)Stable patients — Patients with TdP who are hemodynamically stable on presentation may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. As such, therapy should be promptly provided to most patients. A stable patient is one who typically shows no evidence of hemodynamic compromise but may have frequent, repetitive bursts of TdP. This patient should have continuous monitoring and frequent reevaluations due to the potential for rapid deterioration as long as the TdP persists. ●For patients with a single episode of TdP, treatment with IV magnesium along with correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements and/or removal of any inciting medications may be sufficient. The patient should be carefully monitored until electrolytes are normalized and the QT interval nearly normalizes.●For patients with multiple self-terminating episodes of TdP, the same therapies are utilized as in patients with a single episode (ie, IV magnesium, correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements, and/or removal of any inciting medications), along with additional interventions to increase the heart rate, which include overdrive pacing and/or IV isoproterenol infusion.Patients with other arrhythmias — The management of other arrhythmias in the setting of COVID-19 infection is no different from the routine management of these conditions without COVID-19 infection. Please refer to the following topics for management:Atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular tachycardias:●(See ""Overview of the acute management of tachyarrhythmias"".)●(See ""Overview of atrial fibrillation"".)●(See ""Overview of atrial flutter"".)●(See ""Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia"".)●(See ""Treatment of symptomatic arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome"".)●(See ""Focal atrial tachycardia"".) Monomorphic VT:●(See ""Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management"".)●(See ""Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: Treatment and prognosis"".)●(See ""Ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease"".) Conduction system disease:●(See ""Sinus node dysfunction: Treatment"".)●(See ""Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block"".)●(See ""Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II"".)●(See ""Temporary cardiac pacing"".)Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc) — While efficacy data are limited and generally inconclusive, many patients are being treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine [10,21,22], which are structurally similar to quinidine and have QT-prolonging effects by blocking activation of the potassium channel IKr (hERG/Kv11.1) [4,23,24]. Other medications with QT-prolonging effects may be tried for COVID-19 (table 1). In addition, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by CYP3A4, so other medications that inhibit this cytochrome could raise plasma levels [23]. The best available evidence highlights the potential for toxicity of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without an associated mortality benefit in patients with COVID-19. Among a multinational registry of 96,032 patients (from 671 hospitals on 6 continents) with COVID-19, 14,888 patients received treatment with chloroquine alone (n = 1868), chloroquine plus a macrolide (n = 3783), hydroxychloroquine alone (n = 3016), or hydroxychloroquine plus a macrolide (n = 6221), while 81,144 controls received none of these medications [22]. While there was no significant difference in the history of arrhythmia between any of the treatment groups and the control group (between 3.3 and 3.6 percent in all groups), de novo ventricular arrhythmia was rare in the control group (0.3 percent) but significantly more common in all treatment groups, as follows:●Chloroquine alone – 81 patients (4.3 percent; adjusted HR 3.6; adjusted HR 2.8-4.6)●Chloroquine plus macrolide – 246 patients (6.5 percent; adjusted HR 4.0; 95% CI 3.3-4.8)●Hydroxychloroquine alone – 184 patients (6.1 percent; adjusted HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.9-2.9)●Hydroxychloroquine plus macrolide – 502 patients (8.1 percent; adjusted HR 5.1; 95% CI 4.1-6.0)Monitoring for QT prolongation — The patient's baseline QTc value should be obtained prior to administering any drugs with the potential to prolong the QT interval [25]. The best method to obtain the QT interval is with a 12-lead ECG, but to reduce exposure to staff, this may not always be feasible. A single-lead ECG may underestimate the QT interval, and there should be an attempt to use a multiple-lead telemetry system to monitor the QT interval. There has been some outpatient use of hydroxychloroquine also, but there is no clear guidance regarding how to monitor these patients. Ambulatory ECG monitoring technologies, including the use of mobile or wearable technologies (eg, mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry), have been reported as reliable alternatives when the demand exceeds capacity for standard telemetry monitoring [26]. It is also important for patients being treated with QT-prolonging drugs to report promptly any new symptoms including palpitations, syncope, or near-syncope. They should also report clinical changes that could lead to hypokalemia, such as gastroenteritis or the initiation of diuretic therapy. In general, patients with the following QTc intervals are at low risk for significant QT prolongation and polymorphic VT:●QTc <460 milliseconds in prepubertal males/females●QTc <470 milliseconds in postpubertal males●QTc <480 milliseconds in postpubertal femalesPatients with baseline QTc interval ≥500 milliseconds (with a QRS ≤120 milliseconds) are at increased risk for significant QT prolongation and polymorphic VT [27]. In such patients, efforts should be made to correct any contributing electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and/or hypomagnesemia), with a goal potassium of close to 5 mEq/L. Even in those with a normal QT interval, there should be a review and discontinuation of any QT-prolonging medications that may not be essential to the immediate care of the patient (eg, proton pump inhibitors, etc) (table 1) [28]. In particular, when more than one QT-prolonging agent is being used simultaneously, we recommend one of the following approaches:●One protocol has been published from the Mayo Clinic, using the same QTc cutoffs as above [29]. If two to three hours after a dose of hydroxychloroquine or other QT-prolonging agent, the QTc increases to ≥500 milliseconds or if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds, there should be a reevaluation of the risk of TdP versus benefit of the medication, and the following steps should be taken:•Recognition that there is an increased risk of TdP.•Discontinuation of all other QT-prolonging medications.•Correction of all electrolyte abnormalities.•Place the patient on continuous telemetry, with consideration of a wearable defibrillator or placement of external defibrillator patches.•If TdP develops, then hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin or other medication should be stopped.●Another protocol proposes an ECG at baseline and again at four hours after hydroxychloroquine or other antiviral medication administration only if there is congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, patients are already taking other QT-prolonging medications, or patients have structural heart disease or bradycardia [23]. Another ECG can be completed one to three days later. For most others, an ECG or other QTc interval-monitoring method can be done 24 hours after starting the medication. If the QTc increases to ≥500 milliseconds, if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds, or if ventricular ectopy develops, this protocol recommends cardiology consultation. ●There has been a risk score developed in hospitalized patients for the prediction of QT interval prolongation, though not necessarily for the use of hydroxychloroquine [30,31]. It classifies patients as low, moderate, or high risk for TdP, which may allow for triaging whether continuous telemetry is needed while using the QT-prolonging medication, especially if there are limited resources and the patient could otherwise be followed as an outpatient. Signs of toxicity — There have also been anecdotal reports of toxicity associated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Doses of 5 gm of chloroquine will usually lead to death [32]. Symptoms typically occur in the first hour after ingestion, with seizures or cardiac arrest, as these medications are similar to quinidine, a sodium channel blocker. Cardiovascular toxicities include a widened QRS, prolonged QT interval, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, and hypotension. If ingestion is acute, activated charcoal may be used. In general, treatment involves epinephrine, high-dose diazepam, and repletion of potassium [33]. However, if too much potassium is given, there can be rebound hyperkalemia when there is intracellular shifting out of the cells. A bicarbonate IV infusion may be given, but there should be care in that it may lead to worsening hypokalemia. IV lipid emulsion has also been attempted in limited reports [34]. A local poison control center may be contacted for additional help. Brugada syndrome — Because there is an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of fever in those with Brugada syndrome, aggressive fever reduction with acetaminophen is imperative. High-risk patients, such as those with a spontaneous type 1 pattern ECG and prior syncope, might consider going to an emergency department if they have fever that cannot be promptly lowered with acetaminophen [23]. (See ""Brugada syndrome: Prognosis, management, and approach to screening"", section on 'Treatment'.)PROGNOSIS — Mortality rates appear to increase significantly with increasing age; case fatality rates <1 percent have been reported for those under 50 years of age, with rates approaching 15 percent for patients 80 years of age or older [35]. Similarly, mortality increases with disease severity, as there were no deaths reported among the mild or severe cases in the Chinese cohort, but mortality approached 50 percent among critically ill patients [35]. Underlying medical comorbidities appear to significantly impact COVID-19 severity and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and hypertension have been reported to have significantly high-case fatality rates compared with patients without these underlying comorbidities (10.5 and 6 percent mortality, respectively, compared with 0.9 percent mortality without underlying comorbidities) [35,36]. Similarly, patients in a multinational cohort who died from COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to have a history of cardiac arrhythmias [5].IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PROVIDERS CARING FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS — In addition to providing the best possible care for each patient, infection control to limit transmission is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 [4,37-41].Inpatient care and consultation — The approach to caring for hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 differs slightly, with the intent to reduce exposure to (and spread of) COVID-19 to health care providers. In general, the number of persons interacting directly with the patient and the time spent in the room should be minimized. Social distancing should be maintained, with both the patient and other members of the health care team. The following steps, when possible, will minimize exposure of personnel and limit the use of PPE:●For stable new admissions, the patient should be seen in person by the attending physician and at most one house officer or advanced practitioner (when applicable).●For stable patients on daily rounds, one person on the primary care team should enter the room to conduct the needed physical exam, with the rest of the team participating from outside the room via video chat or telephone.●Routine arrhythmia consultations, particularly in stable patients with ECG evidence documenting a specific arrhythmia or conduction disorder, can be completed without entering the patient's room by reviewing the available records and ECG monitoring data. ●Consider placing all patients on telemetry with concerns of arrhythmias, thereby reducing the need for in-room vital signs.●Utilize rooms with windows in the door to assist with monitoring patients from outside of the room. Patients can be contacted by telephone for routine matters without requiring entry into the room.Arrhythmia-related procedures — In order to maximize the available health care system resources to treat COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, while also minimizing the potential exposure of health care personnel to asymptomatic carriers of the virus, elective and nonurgent procedures should be postponed until a later date. A discussion of the reasoning behind the decision to postpone any procedure should be communicated to the patient and documented in the medical record. Conversely, urgent and semiurgent procedures should be performed when the perceived benefits of the procedure to the patient outweigh the risks of resource utilization and health care personnel exposure. Examples of the types of procedures in each category are as follows [4,37]: Urgent (substantial risk of decompensation, hospitalization, or death if the procedure is delayed):●VT ablation for medically uncontrolled electrical storm in a hemodynamically compromised patient.●Catheter ablation of incessant, hemodynamically significant, severely symptomatic tachycardia (supraventricular VT [SVT]/atrial fibrillation [AF]/atrial flutter) not responding to antiarrhythmic drugs, rate control, and/or cardioversion.●Catheter ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or preexcited AF with syncope or cardiac arrest.●Lead revision for malfunction in a pacemaker-dependent patient or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patient receiving inappropriate therapy.●Generator change in pacemaker-dependent patients who are at elective replacement indicator (ERI) or at device end of life. ●Pacemaker or ICD generator change with minimal battery remaining, depending on specific clinical situations.●Secondary prevention ICD.●Pacemaker implant for complete heart block, Mobitz II atrioventricular (AV) block, or high-grade AV block with symptoms or severe symptomatic sinus node dysfunction with long pauses.●Lead/device extraction for infection, including patients not responding to antibiotics for endocarditis, bacteremia, or pocket infection.●Cardiac resynchronization therapy in the setting of severe refractory heart failure in guideline-indicated patients.●Cardioversion for highly symptomatic atrial arrhythmias or rapid ventricular rates not controlled with medications.●Transesophageal echocardiogram for patients who need urgent cardioversion.Semiurgent (those procedures not deemed urgent but should be performed in a timely manner due to the clinical scenario): ●VT ablation for medically refractory recurrent VT. ●SVT ablation in patients with medically refractory SVT, resulting in emergency department visits. ●Cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) generator replacement for ERI battery status that is not urgent. ●Primary prevention ICD in patients at particularly high risk of life-threating ventricular arrhythmia. Nonurgent (those procedures that may be delayed for weeks or months):●Premature ventricular complex ablation. ●SVT ablation. ●AF and atrial flutter ablation in stable patients without heart failure, not at significant risk of getting hospitalized by delaying the procedure, or at high risk for procedure-related complications due to comorbidities. ●Electrophysiology testing to evaluate stable tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia. ●Primary prevention ICD that is not semiurgent. ●Cardiac resynchronization therapy in stable patients.●CIED upgrade. ●Pacemaker implant for sinus node dysfunction, Mobitz I AV block, other stable non-high-degree AV block, or tachy-brady syndrome in mildly symptomatic patients. ●Pacemaker or ICD generator replacements in patients with >6 weeks of battery remaining. ●Extraction of noninfected devices/leads unless device function is dependent on lead extraction and reimplant. ●Cardioversion for stable arrhythmias with well-tolerated symptoms. ●Left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in patients who can be on anticoagulation.●Transesophageal echocardiogram for routine assessment of valves or LAA closure devices and cardioversions that can be done after appropriate period of anticoagulation.●Implantable loop recorder implants.●Tilt-table testing.Perioperative cardiac implantable electrical device management — For patients with a CIED undergoing surgery or an endoscopic procedure, it is important to know if the patient is pacemaker dependent, if the patient has an ICD with therapies activated, and the likelihood of electromagnetic interference (EMI) during the procedure (eg, due to electrocautery, etc). In a patient with documented or suspected COVID-19 who is undergoing a procedure with a high likelihood of EMI that could result in pacemaker or ICD malfunction, application of a magnet may be used to suspend antitachyarrhythmia therapy in an ICD or to produce asynchronous pacing in a pacemaker [38]. This allows the patient to safely proceed with the necessary procedure without reprogramming the CIED before and after the procedure, thereby reducing the risk to health care personnel and preserving personal protective equipment (PPE).The standard approach to CIED management, which includes in-person reprogramming of the CIED before and after the procedure, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Perioperative management of patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"".)Cardiac implantable electrical device interrogations — For most patients, the majority of CIED follow-up device interrogations on modern-era devices can be done either in person or remotely. To maintain social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend remote CIED interrogations for the vast majority of stable patients [38].Certain situations remain, however, in which an in-person CIED interrogation may be the preferred option, including [4,38]:●Suspected CIED malfunction, including:•Inappropriate pacemaker pacing or sensing noted on ECG or telemetry monitoring.•Failure of ICD to deliver therapy during documented sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia.●Clinically actionable abnormality of CIED or suspicion of the device being at or near end of battery life, noted on remote monitoring, telemetry, or ambulatory monitoring.●ICD shocks, presyncope, or syncope concerning for an arrhythmic event to perform programming changes.●Untreated sustained ventricular arrhythmias in a patient with an ICD.●Evaluation of symptoms suspicious for arrhythmia or abnormal device function in patients who are not enrolled in remote monitoring.●Identified need for reprogramming of the CIED, or ICD patients whose device is delivering auditory or vibratory alerts.●Assessment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a patient with a stroke and no clear documentation of AF on ECG or telemetry monitoring.●For CIED patients requiring urgent or emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, consider performing a computed tomography scan instead if possible (to minimize the need for additional health care provider or device manufacturer representative contact); if not urgent, delay the MRI. ●Patients in the emergency department (or other setting) where remote monitoring is not available. Remote monitoring should be used wherever possible, including the option of asking family to bring the patient's home monitoring equipment to the hospital. After in-person CIED interrogation is performed, it is important to disinfect any parts of the programmer (eg, the programming wand and cord) that have been in contact with the patient. If available, disposable plastic wand coverings may be used to minimize contamination, and consideration should also be given to using a dedicated interrogation device in all settings with known or suspected COVID-19-positive patients. To reduce exposure of health care personnel to CIED patients, a doughnut magnet can be used as an alternative to a complete CIED interrogation or reprogramming [39]. When a hospitalized patient has a pacemaker that does not have remote monitoring capabilities, and proper function of the pacemaker is in question, temporary application of a doughnut magnet over the pacemaker is safe to quickly determine whether or not the pacemaker is capable of delivering pacing stimuli that can capture the heart. Magnet application will place the pacemaker in an asynchronous pacing mode. Depending on the manufacturer and programmed settings, this may include changes in the paced rate, which gives evidence of battery status (ie, elective replacement indicator) or whether there is pacemaker capture. In addition, demonstration of ventricular capture should provide basic reassurance that the pacemaker is functional and can avoid the need for a complete pacemaker interrogation. (See ""Perioperative management of patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"".)Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) — In general, basic life support and advanced cardiac life support for patients with COVID-19 should be administered in standard fashion, similar to patients without COVID-19, with the following exceptions [4,40] (see ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"", section on 'Resuscitation of patients with COVID-19'):●Any personnel caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate PPE before entering the room: gown, gloves, eye protection, and a respirator (eg, an N95 respirator). If supply of respirators is limited, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges that facemasks are an acceptable alternative (in addition to contact precautions and eye protection), but respirators should be worn during aerosol-generating procedures, which includes intubation. The appropriate PPE should all be donned prior to interacting with the patient, even if this leads to a delay in the provision of resuscitative care.●The number of people involved in the resuscitation should be kept to a minimum. This typically includes a team leader, anesthesiologist to manage the airway (if the patient is not already intubated), recorder/scribe, and persons to perform chest compressions, defibrillation, and administration of medications (often, these participants can rotate to allow for periods of rest after performing chest compressions).●In COVID-19 patients who are not yet intubated at the time of cardiac arrest, early intubation should be performed by the provider most likely to achieve success on the first pass, utilizing all readily available technology (eg, video laryngoscopy) to optimize first-pass success. Chest compression can be stopped during intubation, and intubation (with a cuffed endotracheal tube) can be performed prior to the standard two minutes of chest compressions and early defibrillation as a means of controlling the potential spread of airborne droplets.●If available, mechanical chest compression device may be used in place of manual compressions for adults and adolescents who meet minimum height and weight requirements.●For a critically ill patient who is already intubated and in the prone position at the time of arrest, CPR may be attempted with the patient prone by performing compressions with the hands over the T7/10 vertebral bodies. Defibrillation may be performed with the pads in the anterior-posterior position. The patient should be turned to the supine position for resuscitation only if able to do so without equipment disconnections that may lead to aerosolization of viral particles.●For out-of-hospital resuscitation efforts, lay rescuers should perform chest compression-only CPR while wearing a face mask or cloth covering. When available, an automated external defibrillator should be applied and used according to the usual protocol. (See ""Automated external defibrillators"" and ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"", section on 'Defibrillation'.)Initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, with the exception of IV magnesium, is not indicated for hemodynamically unstable or pulseless patients. A full discussion of the standard approaches to basic life support and advanced cardiac life support is presented separately. (See ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"" and ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of arrhythmias or conduction system disease. However, patients in whom arrhythmias may be seen include patients with myocardial injury, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, shock, electrolyte disturbances, or those receiving medications known to prolong the QT interval. (See 'Signs and symptoms' above.)●All patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected should have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the time of entry into the health care system. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single-lead or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient. Continuous ECG monitoring and echocardiography are not required in all patients but can be used in select situations. (See 'Cardiovascular testing' above.)●Patients with sustained torsades de pointes (TdP) usually become hemodynamically unstable, severely symptomatic, or pulseless and should be treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms, including cardioversion/defibrillation (algorithm 1). Patients with TdP who are hemodynamically stable on presentation may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. Treatment with intravenous (IV) magnesium along with correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements and/or removal of any inciting medications may be sufficient, although patients with frequent recurrent episodes may require additional interventions. (See 'Patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes)' above.)●Patients receiving QT-prolonging medications should have a baseline QTc value obtained prior to administering the drugs. If the QTc subsequently increases to ≥500 milliseconds or if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds from the baseline ECG, the risk versus benefit of continued treatment with the QT-prolonging medication should be reassessed, with consideration of dose adjustment or additional intervention. (See 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' above.)●The approach to caring for hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 differs slightly, with the intent to reduce exposure to (and spread of) COVID-19 to health care providers. In general, the number of persons interacting directly with the patient and the time spent in the room should be minimized. Social distancing should be maintained, with both the patient and other members of the health care team. (See 'Inpatient care and consultation' above and 'Arrhythmia-related procedures' above.)●The approaches to cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) interrogations and perioperative CIED management are summarized in the text. Strategies to avoid in-person device interrogations should be deployed. (See 'Cardiac implantable electrical device interrogations' above and 'Perioperative cardiac implantable electrical device management' above.)●In general, basic life support and advanced cardiac life support for patients with COVID-19 should be administered in standard fashion as for patients without COVID-19. However, any personnel caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (including gown, gloves, eye protection, and a respirator or face mask) before entering the room, the number of people involved in the resuscitation should be kept to a minimum, and early intubation should be performed for patients who are not yet intubated at the time of cardiac arrest.
