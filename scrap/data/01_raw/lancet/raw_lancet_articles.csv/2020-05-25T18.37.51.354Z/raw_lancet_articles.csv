Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19.MethodsWe did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).Findings96 032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital.

William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The absence of an effective treatment against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led clinicians to redirect drugs that are known to be effective for other medical conditions to the treatment of COVID-19. Key among these repurposed therapeutic agents are the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine, which is used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.1Principi N Esposito S Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of COVID-19.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online April 17.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30296-6Google Scholar,  2Perricone C Triggianese P Bartoloni E et al.The anti-viral facet of anti-rheumatic drugs: lessons from COVID-19.J Autoimmun. 2020;  (published online April 17.)DOI:10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102468Google Scholar These drugs have been shown in laboratory conditions to have antiviral properties as well as immunomodulatory effects.3Liu J Cao R Xu M et al.Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 16Google Scholar,  4Devaux CA Rolain JM Colson P Raoult D New insights on the antiviral effects of chloroquine against coronavirus: what to expect for COVID-19?.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 12.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938Google Scholar However, the use of this class of drugs for COVID-19 is based on a small number of anecdotal experiences that have shown variable responses in uncontrolled observational analyses, and small, open-label, randomised trials that have largely been inconclusive.5Tang W Cao Z Han M et al.Hydroxychloroquine in patients mainly with mild to moderate COVID-19: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online May 7.)

Moreover, we screened preprint servers, such as Medrxiv, for relevant articles and consulted the web pages of organisations such as the US National Institutes of Health and WHO. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (used with or without a macrolide) are widely advocated for treatment of COVID-19 based on in-vitro evidence of an antiviral effect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Their use is based on small uncontrolled studies and in the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials. Concerns have been raised that these drugs or their combination with macrolides could result in electrical instability and predispose patients to ventricular arrhythmias. Whether these drugs improve outcomes or are associated with harm in COVID-19 remains unknown.Added value of this studyIn the absence of reported randomised trials, there is an urgent need to evaluate real-world evidence related to outcomes with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (used with or without macrolides) in COVID-19. Using an international, observational registry across six continents, we assessed 96 032 patients with COVID-19, of whom 14 888 were treated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or their combination with a macrolide. After controlling for age, sex, race or ethnicity, underlying comorbidities, and disease severity at baseline, the use of all four regimens was associated with an increased hazard for de-novo ventricular arrythmia and death in hospital. This study provides real-world evidence on the use of these therapeutic regimens by including a large number of patients from across the world. Thus, to our knowledge, these findings provide the most comprehensive evidence of the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) for treatment of COVID-19.Implications of all the available evidenceWe found no evidence of benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used either alone or with a macrolide. Previous evidence was derived from either small anecdotal studies or inconclusive small randomised trials. Our study included a large number of patients across multiple geographic regions and provides the most robust real-world evidence to date on the usefulness of these treatment regimens. Although observational studies cannot fully account for unmeasured confounding factors, our findings suggest not only an absence of therapeutic benefit but also potential harm with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine drug regimens (with or without a macrolide) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

Although several multicentre randomised controlled trials are underway, there is a pressing need to provide accurate clinical guidance because the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine along with macrolides is widespread, often with little regard for potential risk. Some countries have stockpiled these drugs, resulting in a shortage of these medications for those that need them for approved clinical indications.10Peschken CA Possible consequences of a shortage of hydroxychloroquine for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus amid the COVID-19 pandemic.J Rheumatol. 2020;  (published online April 8.)DOI:10.3899/jrheum.200395Google Scholar The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19 using a large multinational registry to assess their real-world application. Principally, we sought to analyse the association between these treatment regimens and in-hospital death. Secondarily, we aimed to evaluate the occurrence of de-novo clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias. We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised 671 hospitals located in six continents (appendix p 3). The Surgical Outcomes Collaborative (Surgisphere Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA) consists of de-identified data obtained by automated data extraction from inpatient and outpatient electronic health records, supply chain databases, and financial records. The registry uses a cloud-based health-care data analytics platform that includes specific modules for data acquisition, data warehousing, data analytics, and data reporting. A manual data entry process is used for quality assurance and validation to ensure that key missing values are kept to a minimum. The Surgical Outcomes Collaborative (hereafter referred to as the Collaborative) ensures compliance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on real-world evidence. Real-world data are collected through automated data transfers that capture 100% of the data from each health-care entity at regular, predetermined intervals, thus reducing the impact of selection bias and missing values, and ensuring that the data are current, reliable, and relevant. Verifiable source documentation for the elements include electronic inpatient and outpatient medical records and, in accordance with the FDA guidance on relevance of real-world data, data acquisition is performed through use of a standardised Health Level Seven-compliant data dictionary, with data collected on a prospective ongoing basis. The validation procedure for the registry refers to the standard operating procedures in place for each of the four ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 27001:2013 certified features of the registry: data acquisition, data warehousing, data analytics, and data reporting. The standardised Health Level Seven-compliant data dictionary used by the Collaborative serves as the focal point for all data acquisition and warehousing. Once this data dictionary is harmonised with electronic health record data, data acquisition is completed using automated interfaces to expedite data transfer and improve data integrity. Collection of a 100% sample from each health-care entity is validated against financial records and external databases to minimise selection bias. To reduce the risk of inadvertent protected health information disclosures, all such information is stripped before storage in the cloud-based data warehouse. The Collaborative is intended to minimise the effects of information bias and selection bias by capturing all-comer data and consecutive patient enrolment by capturing 100% of the data within electronic systems, ensuring that the results remain generalisable to the larger population. The Collaborative is compliant with the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines for registries. With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, this registry was used to collect data from hospitals in the USA (that are selected to match the epidemiological characteristics of the US population) and internationally, to achieve representation from diverse populations across six continents. Data have been collected from a variety of urban and rural hospitals, academic or community hospitals, and for-profit and non-profit hospitals. The data collection and analyses are deemed exempt from ethics review. We included all patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, at hospitals participating in the registry and with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection, for whom a clinical outcome of either hospital discharge or death during hospitalisation was recorded. A positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assay of nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens, and this finding was used for classifying a patient as positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 was diagnosed, at each site, on the basis of WHO guidance.11WHOClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when novel COVID-19 disease is suspected: interim guidance.https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdfDate: March 13, 2020Date accessed: April 24, 2020Google Scholar Patients who did not have a record of testing in the database, or who had a negative test, were not included in the study. Only one positive test was necessary for the patient to be included in the analysis. Patients who received either hydroxychloroquine or a chloroquine analogue-based treatment (with or without a second-generation macrolide) were included in the treatment group. Patients who received treatment with these regimens starting more than 48 h after COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. We also excluded data from patients for whom treatment was initiated while they were on mechanical ventilation or if they were receiving therapy with the antiviral remdesivir. These specific exclusion criteria were established to avoid enrolment of patients in whom the treatment might have started at non-uniform times during the course of their COVID-19 illness and to exclude individuals for whom the drug regimen might have been used during a critical phase of illness, which could skew the interpretation of the results. Thus, we defined four distinct treatment groups, in which all patients started therapy within 48 h of an established COVID-19 diagnosis: chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide. All other included patients served as the control population. Patient demographics, including age, body-mass index (BMI), sex, race or ethnicity, and continent of origin were obtained. Underlying comorbidities (based on International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification codes) present in either the inpatient or outpatient electronic health record were collected, which included cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and history of a cardiac arrhythmia), current or previous history of smoking, history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and presence of an immunosuppressed condition (steroid use, pre-existing immunological condition, or current chemotherapy in individuals with cancer). We collected data on use of medications at baseline, including cardiac medications (angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins) or use of antiviral therapy other than the drug regimens being evaluated. The initiation of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine during hospital admission was recorded, including the time of initiation. The use of second-generation macrolides, specifically azithromycin and clarithromycin, was similarly recorded. A quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) was calculated for the start of therapy (including a scored calculation of the mental status, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) on room air was recorded, as measures of disease severity. The primary outcome of interest was the association between use of a treatment regimen containing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (with or without a second-generation macrolide) when initiated early after COVID-19 diagnosis with the endpoint of in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome of interest was the association between these treatment regimens and the occurrence of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (defined as the first occurrence of a non-sustained [at least 6 sec] or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) during hospitalisation. We also analysed the rates of progression to mechanical ventilation use and the total and intensive care unit lengths of stay (in days) for patients in each group. For the primary analysis of in-hospital mortality, we controlled for confounding factors, including demographic variables, comorbidities, disease severity at presentation, and other medication use (cardiac medications and other antiviral therapies). Categorical variables are shown as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as means with SDs. Comparison of continuous data between groups was done using the unpaired t-test and categorical data were compared using Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0·05 was considered significant. Multiple imputation for missing values was not possible because for disease and drug variables, there were no codes to indicate that data were missing; if the patient's electronic health record did not include information on a clinical characteristic, it was assumed that the characteristic was not present. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to evaluate the effect of age, sex, race or ethnicity (using white race as a reference group), comorbidities (BMI, presence of coronary artery disease, presence of congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, or COPD, current smoker, history of hypertension, immunocompromised state, and history of hyperlipidaemia), medications (cardiac medications, antivirals, and the treatment regimens of interest), and severity of illness scores (qSOFA <1 and SPO2 <94%) on the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia (using the time from admission to first occurrence, or if the event did not occur, to the time of discharge) and mortality (using the time from admission to inpatient mortality or discharge). Age and BMI were treated as continuous variables and all other data were treated as categorical variables in the model. From the model, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated for included variables to determine their effect on the risk of in-hospital mortality (primary endpoint) or subsequent mechanical ventilation or death (composite endpoint). Independence of survival times (or time to first arrhythmia for the ventricular arrhythmia analysis) was confirmed. Proportionality between the predictors and the hazard was validated through an evaluation of Schoenfeld residuals, which found p>0·05 and thus confirmed proportionality. To minimise the effect of confounding factors, a propensity score matching analysis was done individually for each of the four treatment groups compared with a control group that received no form of that therapy. For each treatment group, a separate matched control was identified using exact and propensity-score matched criteria with a calliper of 0·001. This method was used to provide a close approximation of demographics, comorbidities, disease severity, and baseline medications between patients. The propensity score was based on the following variables: age, BMI, gender, race or ethnicity, comorbidities, use of ACE inhibitors, use of statins, use of angiotensin receptor blockers, treatment with other antivirals, qSOFA score of less than 1, and SPO2 of less than 94% on room air. The patients were well matched, with standardised mean difference estimates of less than 10% for all matched parameters. Additional analyses were done to examine the robustness of the estimates initially obtained. Individual analyses by continent of origin and sex-adjusted analyses using Cox proportional hazards models were performed. A tipping-point analysis (an analysis that shows the effect size and prevalence of an unmeasured confounder that could shift the upper boundary of the CI towards null) was also done. All statistical analyses were done with R version 3.6.3 and SPSS version 26.

All included patients completed their hospital course (discharged or died) by April 21, 2020. Patients who were hospitalised during the study period without a completed course were unable to be analysed. The study cohort included 63 315 (65·9%) patients from North America, 16 574 (17·3%) from Europe, 7555 (7·9%) from Asia, 4402 (4·6%) from Africa, 3577 (3·7%) from South America, and 609 (0·6%) from Australia (details of the number of hospitals per continent are presented in the appendix, p 3). The mean age was 53·8 years (SD 17·6), 44 426 (46·3%) were women, mean BMI was 27·6 kg/m2 (SD 5·5; 29 510 [30·7%] were obese with BMI ≥30 kg/m2), 64 220 (66·9%) were white, 9054 (9·4%) were black, 5978 (6·2%) were Hispanic, and 13 519 (14·1%) were of Asian origin (appendix p 4). In terms of comorbidities, 30 198 (31·4%) had hyperlipidaemia, 25 810 (26·9%) had hypertension, 13 260 (13·8%) had diabetes, 3177 (3·3%) had COPD, 2868 (3·0%) had an underlying immunosuppressed condition, 16 553 (17·2%) were former smokers, and 9488 (9·9%) were current smokers. In terms of pre-existing cardiovascular disease, 12 137 (12·6%) had coronary artery disease, 2368 (2·5%) had a history of congestive heart failure, and 3381 (3·5%) had a history of arrhythmia. The mean length of stay in hospital was 9·1 days (SD 6·4), with an overall in-hospital mortality of 10 698 (11·1%) of 96 032. The use of other antivirals was recorded in 38 927 (40·5%) patients as treatment for COVID-19. The most common antivirals were lopinavir with ritonavir (12 304 [31·6%]), ribavirin (7904 [20·3%]), and oseltamivir (5101 [13·1%]). Combination therapy with more than one of these antiviral regimens was used for 6782 (17·4%) patients.Figure 1Study profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) The treatment groups included 1868 patients who were given chloroquine alone, 3016 given hydroxychloroquine alone, 3783 given chloroquine with a macrolide and 6221 given hydroxychloroquine and a macrolide. The median time from hospitalisation to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2 days (IQR 1–4). The mean daily dose and duration of the various drug regimens were as follows: chloroquine alone, 765 mg (SD 308) and 6·6 days (2·4); hydroxychloroquine alone, 596 mg (126) and 4·2 days (1·9); chloroquine with a macrolide, 790 mg (320) and 6·8 days (2·5); and hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, 597 mg (128) and 4·3 days (2·0). Additional details of the study cohort are provided in the appendix (pp 4–5). Demographic variables and comorbidities were compared among survivors and non-survivors (table 1). Non-survivors were older, more likely to be obese, more likely to be men, more likely to be black or Hispanic, and to have diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and a history of arrhythmias. Non-survivors were also more likely to have COPD and to have reported current smoking.Table 1Demographics and comorbidities of patients by survival or non-survival during hospitalisationSurvivors (n=85 334)Non-survivors (n=10 698)p valueAge, years53·1 (17·5)60·0 (17·6)<0·0001BMI, kg/m227·0 (5·1)31·8 (6·4)<0·0001Obese, BMI >30 kg/m222 992 (26·9%)6518 (60·9%)<0·0001SexFemale40 169 (47·1%)4257 (39·8%)<0·0001Male45 165 (52·9%)6441 (60·2%)<0·0001Race or ethnicityWhite57 503 (67·4%)6717 (62·8%)<0·0001Black7219 (8·5%)1835 (17·2%)<0·0001Hispanic4948 (5·8%)1030 (9·6%)<0·0001Asian12 657 (14·8%)862 (8·1%)<0·0001Native American1023 (1·2%)56 (0·5%)<0·0001Other1984 (2·3%)198 (1·9%)0·0019Comorbidities at baselineCoronary artery disease9777 (11·5%)2360 (22·1%)<0·0001Congestive heart failure1828 (2·1%)540 (5·0%)<0·0001Arrhythmia2700 (3·2%)681 (6·4%)<0·0001Diabetes10 963 (12·8%)2297 (21·5%)<0·0001Hypertension21 948 (25·7%)3862 (36·1%)<0·0001Hyperlipidaemia26 480 (31·0%)3718 (34·8%)<0·0001COPD2603 (3·1%)574 (5·4%)<0·0001Current smoker7972 (9·3%)1516 (14·2%)<0·0001Former smoker14 681 (17·2%)1872 (17·5%)0·45Immunocompromised2406 (2·8%)462 (4·3%)<0·0001MedicationsACE inhibitor7521 (8·8%)428 (4·0%)<0·0001Statin8506 (10·0%)739 (6·9%)<0·0001Angiotensin receptor blocker5190 (6·1%)659 (6·2%)0·75Antiviral35 189 (41·2%)3738 (34·9%)<0·0001Disease severityqSOFA <171 457 (83·7%)7911 (73·9%)<0·0001SPO2 <94%7188 (8·4%)2129 (19·9%)<0·0001Treatment groupChloroquine alone1561 (1·8%)307 (2·9%)<0·0001Chloroquine with macrolide** Macrolides include only azithromycin or clarithromycin.2944 (3·4%)839 (7·8%)<0·0001Hydroxychloroquine alone2473 (2·9%)543 (5·1%)<0·0001Hydroxychloroquine with macrolide** Macrolides include only azithromycin or clarithromycin.4742 (5·6%)1479 (13·8%)<0·0001OutcomesDe-novo ventricular arrhythmia839 (1·0%)400 (3·7%)<0·0001Non-ICU length of stay, days9·0 (6·2)9·8 (7·4)<0·0001ICU length of stay, days2·1 (3·7)9·4 (10·6)<0·0001Total length of stay, days11·1 (7·3)19·2 (14·4)<0·0001Mechanical ventilation4821 (5·6%)4533 (42·4%)<0·0001Data are mean (SD) or n (%).

Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality are shown in figure 2. Age, BMI, black race or Hispanic ethnicity (versus white race), coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, history of arrhythmia, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, COPD, being a current smoker, and immunosuppressed condition were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death. Female sex, ethnicity of Asian origin, use of ACE inhibitors (but not angiotensin receptor blockers), and use of statins was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality risk. Compared with the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine alone (18·0%; HR 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368–1·531), chloroquine alone (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218–1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273–1·469) were independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality.

Analyses using propensity score matching by treatment group are shown in the appendix (pp 15–18). The results indicated that the associations between the drug regimens and mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias were consistent with the primary analysis. A tipping point analysis was done to assess the effects of an unmeasured confounder on the findings of significance with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (appendix pp 19–20). For chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 50% in the exposed population would need to have an HR of 1·5 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. For a comparison with the observed confounders in this study, if congestive heart failure (which has an HR of 1·756) were left out of the model, it would need to have a prevalence of approximately 30% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis. Similarly, for hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 37% in the exposed population would need to have an HR of 2·0 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. Again, congestive heart failure (which has an HR of 1·756) would need to have a prevalence of approximately 50% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis, had it not been adjusted for in the Cox proportional hazards model. In this large multinational real-world analysis, we did not observe any benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (when used alone or in combination with a macrolide) on in-hospital outcomes, when initiated early after diagnosis of COVID-19. Each of the drug regimens of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide was associated with an increased hazard for clinically significant occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of in-hospital death with COVID-19. The use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in COVID-19 is based on widespread publicity of small, uncontrolled studies, which suggested that the combination of hydroxychloroquine with the macrolide azithromycin was successful in clearing viral replication.7Gautret P Lagier JC Parola P et al.Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 20.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949Google Scholar On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for these drugs in patients if clinical trial access was unavailable.12US Food and Drug AdministrationEmergency use authorization: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) EUA information.https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covidtherapeuticsDate accessed: May 15, 2020Google Scholar Other countries, such as China, have issued guidelines allowing for the use of chloroquine in COVID-19.13Gao J Tian Z Yang X Breakthrough: chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies.Biosci Trends. 2020; 14: 72-73Google Scholar Several countries have been stockpiling the drugs, and shortages of them for approved indications, such as for autoimmune disease and rheumatoid arthritis, have been encountered.10Peschken CA Possible consequences of a shortage of hydroxychloroquine for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus amid the COVID-19 pandemic.J Rheumatol. 2020;  (published online April 8.)DOI:10.3899/jrheum.200395Google Scholar A retrospective observational review of 368 men with COVID-19 treated at the US Veterans Affairs hospitals raised concerns that the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a greater hazard of death; however, the baseline characteristics among the groups analysed were dissimilar and the possibility of bias cannot be ruled out.14Magagnoli J Narendran S Pereira F et al.Outcomes of hydroxychloroquine usage in United States veterans hospitalized with COVID-19.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 23.)

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with concerns of cardiovascular toxicity, particularly because of their known relationship with electrical instability, characterised by QT interval prolongation (the time taken for ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation). This mechanism relates to blockade of the hERG potassium channel,16Traebert M Dumotier B Meister L Hoffmann P Dominguez-Estevez M Suter W Inhibition of hERG K+ currents by antimalarial drugs in stably transfected HEK293 cells.Eur J Pharmacol. 2004; 484: 41-48Google Scholar which lengthens ventricular repolarisation and the duration of ventricular action potentials. Under specific conditions, early after-depolarisations can trigger ventricular arrhythmias.9Giudicessi JR Noseworthy PA Friedman PA Ackerman MJ Urgent guidance for navigating and circumventing the QTc-prolonging and torsadogenic potential of possible pharmacotherapies for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).Mayo Clin Proc. 2020;  (published online April 7.)DOI:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.024Google Scholar Such propensity for arrhythmia provocation is more often seen in individuals with structural cardiovascular disease, and cardiac injury has been reported to occur with high frequency during COVID-19 illness.17Shi S Qin M Shen B et al.Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online March 25.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950Google Scholar,  18Guo T Fan Y Chen M et al.Cardiovascular implications of fatal outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online March 27.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017Google Scholar Furthermore, individuals with cardiovascular disease represent a vulnerable population that experience worse outcomes with COVID-19.19Bonow RO Fonarow GC O'Gara PT Yancy CW Association of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with myocardial injury and mortality.JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online March 27.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1105Google Scholar,  20Mehra MR Desai SS Kuy S Henry TD Patel AN Cardiovascular disease, drug therapy, and mortality in COVID-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online May 1.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621Google Scholar Pathological studies have pointed to derangements in the vascular endothelium and a diffuse endotheliitis noted across multiple organs in COVID-19.21Varga Z Flammer AJ Steiger P et al.Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1417-1418Google Scholar Whether patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and those that experience de-novo cardiovascular injury have a greater predilection to ventricular arrhythmias with chloroquine or its analogues remains uncertain but plausible.

Our study did not examine the QT interval but instead directly analysed the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrythmias. We showed an independent association of the use of either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias. We also note that the hazard of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias increased when the drugs were used in combination with a macrolide. In our analysis, which was dominated by patients from North America, we noted that higher BMI emerged as a risk marker for worse in-hospital survival. Obesity is a known risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.27Lavie CJ Arena R Alpert MA Milani RV Ventura HO Management of cardiovascular diseases in patients with obesity.Nat Rev Cardiol. 2018; 15: 45-56Google Scholar,  28Sanchis-Gomar F Lavie CJ Mehra MR Henry BM Lippi G Obesity and outcomes in COVID-19: when an epidemic and pandemic collide.Mayo Clin Proc. 2020;  (published online May 19.)DOI:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.05.006Google Scholar The most commonly reported arrhythmias are atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Although age, race, and BMI were predictive of an increased risk for death with COVID-19 in our analysis, they were not found to be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias on our multivariable regression analysis. The only variables found to be independently predictive of ventricular arrhythmias were the four treatment regimens, along with underlying cardiovascular disease and COPD. Thus, the presence of cardiovascular comorbidity in the study population could partially explain the observed risk of increased cardiovascular toxicity with the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, especially when used in combination with macrolides. In this investigation, consistent with our previous findings in a smaller cohort of 8910 patients,20Mehra MR Desai SS Kuy S Henry TD Patel AN Cardiovascular disease, drug therapy, and mortality in COVID-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online May 1.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621Google Scholar we found that women and patients being treated with ACE inhibitors (but not angiotensin receptor blockers) or statins had lower mortality with COVID-19. These findings imply that drugs that stabilise cardiovascular function and improve endothelial cell dysfunction might improve prognosis, independent of the use of cardiotoxic drug combinations.21Varga Z Flammer AJ Steiger P et al.Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1417-1418Google Scholar Our study has several limitations. The association of decreased survival with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment regimens should be interpreted cautiously. Due to the observational study design, we cannot exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors, although we have reassuringly noted consistency between the primary analysis and the propensity score matched analyses. Nevertheless, a cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred. These data do not apply to the use of any treatment regimen used in the ambulatory, out-of-hospital setting. Randomised clinical trials will be required before any conclusion can be reached regarding benefit or harm of these agents in COVID-19 patients. We also note that although we evaluated the relationship of the drug treatment regimens with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, we did not measure QT intervals, nor did we stratify the arrhythmia pattern (such as torsade de pointes). We also did not establish if the association of increased risk of in-hospital death with use of the drug regimens is linked directly to their cardiovascular risk, nor did we conduct a drug dose-response analysis of the observed risks. Even if these limitations suggest a conservative interpretation of the findings, we believe that the absence of any observed benefit could still represent a reasonable explanation. In summary, this multinational, observational, real-world study of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation found that the use of a regimen containing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) was associated with no evidence of benefit, but instead was associated with an increase in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and a greater hazard for in-hospital death with COVID-19. These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed.

The global community awaits the results of ongoing, well powered randomised controlled trials showing the effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 clinical outcomes. These drugs, however, might be associated with cardiac toxicity.

QTc prolongation can be associated with a specific ventricular arrhythmia called torsade de pointes, which, although often self-terminating, can degenerate into ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, leading to death. Torsade de pointes is a rare event, with an estimated annual crude incidence of 3·2 per million population; the incidence is almost doubled in women compared with men and increases with age.3Sarganas G Garbe E Klimpel A Hering RC Bronder E Haverkamp W Epidemiology of symptomatic drug-induced long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes in Germany.Europace. 2014; 16: 101-108Google Scholar Drug-induced torsade de pointes mostly occurs in the presence of several risk factors, including high drug concentration, simultaneous exposure to multiple QTc-prolonging drugs, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypokalaemia, bradycardia, or congenital long-QT syndrome, among others.4Vlachos K Georgopoulos S Efremidis M Sideris A Letsas KP An update on risk factors for drug-induced arrhythmias.Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2016; 9: 117-127Google Scholar In The Lancet, Mandeep Mehra and colleagues5Mehra MR Desai SS Ruschitzka F Patel AN Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis.Lancet. 2020;  (published online May 22.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31180-6Google Scholar report the largest observational study published to date on the effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, with or without a macrolide, in 96 032 hospitalised patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Verified data from an international registry comprising 671 hospitals in six continents were used to compare patients with COVID-19 who received chloroquine (n=1868), hydroxychloroquine (n=3016), chloroquine with a macrolide (n=3783), or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (n=6221) within 48 h of COVID-19 diagnosis, with 81 144 controls who did not receive these drugs. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was also analysed. A Cox proportional hazard model accounting for many confounding variables, including age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, other medications, and COVID-19 severity, showed a significant increase in the risk of in-hospital mortality with the four treatment regimens compared with the control group (hazard ratios [HRs] of 1·335 [95% CI 1·223–1·457] to 1·447 [1·368–1·531]). Analyses using propensity score matching by treatment group supported this result. The increased risk of in-hospital mortality was similar in men (1·293 [1·178–1·420] to 1·408 [1·309–1·513]) and women (1·338 [1·169–1·531] to 1·494 [1·334–1·672]). The incidence of repetitive ventricular arrhythmias ranged from 4·3% to 8·1% in patients treated with a 4-aminoquinoline, compared with 0·3% in the control group (p<0·0001). Despite limitations inherent to the observational nature of this study, Mehra and colleagues should be commended for providing results from a well designed and controlled study of the effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, with or without a macrolide, in a very large sample of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Their results indicate an absence of benefit of 4-aminoquinoline-based treatments in this population and suggest that they could even be harmful. It is tempting to attribute the increased risk of in-hospital deaths to the higher observed incidence of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias, given that these drugs are known to prolong QTc and provoke torsade de pointes. However, the relationship between death and ventricular tachycardia was not studied and causes of deaths (ie, arrhythmic vs non-arrhythmic) were not adjudicated. Although not all ventricular arrhythmias might have been detected, the number of deaths in the treatment groups was much greater than the number of patients who had ventricular arrhythmias. The risk of death associated with 4-aminoquinolines alone or combined with a macrolide was similar, whereas it would be expected that the combination of two QTc-prolonging drugs would increase their proarrhythmic potential.6Frommeyer G Fischer C Ellermann C et al.Additive proarrhythmic effect of combined treatment with QT-prolonging agents.Cardiovasc Toxicol. 2018; 18: 84-90Google Scholar The HRs for death were similar in men and women, whereas women have a higher sensitivity to drug-induced QTc prolongation7Darpo B Karnad DR Badilini F et al.Are women more susceptible than men to drug-induced QT prolongation?

The study therefore does not suggest that the increased risk of death with 4-aminoquinolines was due to a proarrhythmic mechanism. Another hypothesis to explain the increased risk of death with 4-aminoquinolines is that their antiviral and immunomodulatory properties could worsen COVID-19 severity in some patients. Nevertheless, the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is intriguing.

Several explanations have been advanced for this situation, from a panicking public hoarding masks to the offshoring of manufacturing and the disruption of global trade. The history of medicine suggests another factor could be considered: the progressive replacement of reusable face masks by disposable ones since the 1960s. Medicine has been transformed by consumer culture—what Life Magazine enthusiastically named “Throwaway Living” in 1955. The history of the medical mask illuminates how this vulnerability was created. Covering the nose and mouth had been part of traditional sanitary practices against contagious diseases in early modern Europe. This protection was primarily about neutralising so-called miasma in the air through perfumes and spices held under a mask, such as the plague doctors' bird-like masks. Such practices, however, had become marginal by the 18th century. Face masks, as they are used today in health care and in the community, can be largely traced back historically to a more recent period when a new understanding of contagion based on germ theory was applied to surgery. In 1867, the British surgeon Joseph Lister postulated that wound disease was caused by the germs of the microscopically small living entities that Louis Pasteur had recently described. Lister suggested eliminating germs through the use of antiseptic substances. But in the 1880s, a new generation of surgeons devised the strategy of asepsis that aimed to stop germs from entering wounds in the first place. This was a risky strategy. Hands, instruments, even the operator's exhalations were suspect now. Johann Mikulicz, head of the surgery department of the University of Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) started working with the local bacteriologist Carl Flügge, who had shown experimentally that respiratory droplets carried culturable bacteria. In response to these findings, Mikulicz started to wear a face mask in 1897, which he described as “a piece of gauze tied by two strings to the cap, and sweeping across the face so as to cover the nose and mouth and beard”. In Paris, the surgeon Paul Berger also began wearing a mask in the operating room the same year. The face mask stood for a strategy of infection control that focused on keeping all germs away, as opposed to killing them with chemicals. Such a narrowly targeted strategy was not uncontroversial. The physician Alexander Fraenkel in Berlin, for example, was sceptical about the “whole surgical costume with a bonnet, mouth mask and veil, devised under the slogan of total wound sterility”. However, masks became increasingly widespread. A study of more than 1000 photographs of surgeons in operating rooms in US and European hospitals between 1863 and 1969 indicated that by 1923 over two-thirds of them wore masks and by 1935 most of them were using masks. It was mainly the use of the mask to cover the mouth and nose (and beard) during the Manchurian plague of 1910–11 and the influenza pandemic of 1918–19 that turned the face mask into a means of protecting medical workers and patients from infectious diseases outside of the operating room. During the 1918–19 influenza pandemic, wearing a mask became mandatory for police forces, medical workers, and even residents in some US cities, although its use was often controversial. Yet in cities like San Francisco, the decline in deaths from influenza was partly attributed to the mandatory mask-wearing policies. At this point, the rationale for wearing masks moved beyond their original use in the operating theatre: they now also protected the wearer against infection. Meanwhile, masks continued to be developed in medicine. Although medical practitioners agreed on the general function of the mask, in the first decades of the 20th century they attempted to determine the most efficient type of masks and there were patents on various designs. Masks were usually made of several layers of cotton gauze, sometimes with an additional layer of impervious material, held by a metal frame. Their main goal was to prevent respiratory droplets from being transmitted from and to the wearer, as Mikulicz and Flügge had suggested for the operating theatre. Most masks were washable and the metal parts could be sterilised and “thus permit the use of the mask for a long time”, as one US inventor explained, who had a medical mask patented in 1919.

They found that masks varied greatly in the extent to which they filtered bacteria. But when used properly, some masks were considered to offer protection from infection. Medical masks started to be replaced by disposable paper masks during the 1930s and were increasingly made of synthetic materials for single use in the 1960s. By the early 1960s, there were advertisements for new kinds of filtering masks made of non-woven synthetic fibres in nursing and surgery journals. These filtering masks were all disposable. Advertisements highlighted their performance, comfort, and convenience. Unlike most traditional medical masks, these cup-shaped respirator masks fitted snugly on the face and were designed to filter incoming, not only outgoing, air, as well as to prevent the spread of droplets like traditional masks. These masks could be used only once because their synthetic fabric would deteriorate during sterilisation. The substitution of reusable masks was part of the broader transformation in hospital care towards what a hospital administrator in 1969 called a “total disposable system” that included syringes, needles, trays, and surgical instruments. In part, disposability was supposed to reduce the risk of compromising the precarious state of sterility. However, another reason for switching to disposable masks was a desire to reduce labour costs, facilitate the management of supplies, and to respond to the increased demand for disposables that aggressive marketing campaigns had created among health-care workers. Disposables were convenient, an advantage apparent to anyone “who has seen staff disentangling the tapes and reassembling autoclaved linen masks”, as a British medical researcher put it in 1980. Industry-sponsored studies found the new synthetic masks to be superior to traditional reusable cotton masks. More frequently, however, reusable masks were omitted from comparative studies. In 1975, in one of the last studies to include an industrially manufactured cotton mask, the author concluded that the reusable mask, made of four-ply cotton muslin, was superior to the popular disposable paper masks and the new synthetic respirators. He noted that “cotton fabrics may be as effective as synthetic fabrics when incorporated in a good mask design”. Some studies have suggested that washing reusable masks might increase their bacterial filtering efficiency, perhaps by tightening their fibres. In the absence of commercial cotton masks, more recent studies have only compared artisanal or homemade masks with industrially produced disposable masks, finding the latter to be superior. These results to some extent reinforced the idea that reusable masks were potentially unsafe, partly discouraging further research into well designed and industrially manufactured reusable masks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities in some countries have recommended that citizens wear masks in public under certain circumstances. In this context, a number of grassroots initiatives has emerged, typical of our participatory age, to help people sew cloth masks at home for their personal use and in some communities to supply nearby hospitals. These improvised masks typically overlook some of the design elements that were crucial for the efficiency of earlier cotton masks. Yet the public response has been enthusiastic in some places, at least as measured by the number of people viewing instructional videos. The home production of reusable masks for use in the community offers last resort solutions to some and comfort to many, but is unlikely to contribute more than marginally to solving the shortage of personal protective equipment globally. As for health-care workers and hospitals, in some settings they are experimenting with methods to sanitise disposable masks, even though they were not designed to be reused. Such an approach is a far cry from the carefully designed, manufactured, and tested reusable masks in use until the 1970s. Reusable masks were once an essential part of the medical arsenal. However, the industrial production and further research and development of reusable masks was largely halted with the transition towards disposable masks in the 1960s. Disposable masks and respirators will certainly remain an essential part of medical personal protective equipment in the future, since some of them possess specific filtration qualities designed for health-care situations. To avoid a shortage of masks during the next pandemic, one should look beyond the creation of large stockpiles of disposable face masks and consider the risks of the throwaway consumer culture applied to life-saving devices. Perhaps one day it might again be possible to say about protective face masks what medical researchers wrote in 1918: “A mask may be repeatedly washed and used indefinitely.”"," May 22, 2020",Closed

In many countries, efforts to contain COVID-19 have resulted in an economic recession, pushing millions out of their jobs, and creating previously unprecedented unemployment in many countries worldwide. In addition to the millions of people infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hundreds of thousands have died—and will die—from COVID-19. An anticipated wave of mental and behavioural problems is beginning to be documented—compounded by social and economic stressors and uncertainties—that will likely present a population health burden for months and years to come. COVID-19 has also triggered enormous displays of pro-social behaviour with neighbours coming to the aid of those isolated by the containment efforts and of support for front-line workers, including doctors, nurses, and other health-care personnel, whose responsibilities keep them at risk of infection. In the public conversation about this pandemic, an admirable empathy has been evident for those who have been affected and for those who have died from COVID-19. In some ways, the pandemic has brought populations together, generating an understanding that our health is interlinked and that we could all be at risk. That understanding made it possible, perhaps in an unprecedented way, to empathise with those with the disease and to wish them well out of a clear sense that they could also be us. Infectious diseases have always been the paradigmatic example of diseases that show how our health is interlinked. We take vaccinations and make sure our children are vaccinated both to protect ourselves and as a social good. This impulse is laudable and, indeed, useful. It has helped, for example, ensure that during this pandemic an enormous number of people worldwide have followed guidance and orders to physically distance with relatively little demonstrable social disturbance. In fact, the opposite quickly became true: in many countries social norms shifted to encourage physical distancing, casting opprobrium on those who may have flaunted physical distancing norms and expectations. Public apologies by prominent figures who were found to be flaunting these guidelines became a feature of national media coverage. And yet, it is worth reflecting on the extent to which our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been informed by an understanding that we are all in this together, that the virus does not discriminate, and that as a result it benefits us all to comply with physical distancing guidelines to protect others and ourselves. Our empathy, our capacity to envision that we too could be affected, has been a powerful tool in the public health arsenal. But, in large part, it is hard not to notice that our empathy is informed here, as it often is, by an appreciation of our own personal risk. We feel regret and feel terrible about those who are suffering, in no small part because we can imagine that suffering being our own. But is it true that this suffering is our own? Is it true that COVID-19 does not discriminate? Evidence is emerging that the effects of COVID-19, far from being indiscriminate, follow deeply entrenched patterns of health inequities, mirroring burdens of disease that are near universal. Those with resources, money, and power, often majority racial or ethnic groups, are better able to physically distance, work from home, and retain their employment. Those same groups then have lower risks of becoming infected or dying from COVID-19, probably reflecting a combination of factors, including better access to health care and a lower underlying burden of morbidity that predisposes to worse COVID-19 outcomes. It turns out that COVID-19 does discriminate, and that those who are already vulnerable—for example, the unstably housed, people on low income, those with poorer education, and individuals with less access to reliable nutritious food—are more likely to both become infected with the virus and die from COVID-19. And this is where empathy fails. Empathy in the context of health is largely predicated on our appreciating the risks of a disease because we can imagine getting the disease ourselves. When we imagine we can also be infected, we are then willing to take the steps necessary to protect ourselves—and others—from the disease. And that force has been powerful and contributed to the dramatic change in how we live and in a shutdown of large parts of the world's economy, informed by fear of a novel disease and the need to protect ourselves and others around us.

What if those efforts also result in economic consequences that are inevitably going to be borne principally by those who are vulnerable and marginalised to begin with? What if those efforts are therefore going to result in the long-term widening of health inequities, consigning many people to worse mental and physical health for years to come? How do we account for this eventuality and how do we factor this into our thinking? This calls ultimately for compassion as the animating force behind our thinking about health, and our thinking about how we go about informing the decisions we make to contain a novel threat like COVID-19. Compassion extends beyond empathy. It does not motivate our action because we too may be harmed. Compassion motivates action because the phenomena we observe are unjust, not worthy of the world we would like to live in. Martin Luther King Jr spoke often of compassion, enjoining us to see that compassion ultimately motivates not to “[fling] a coin to a beggar” but to “see that the edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring”. Compassion pushes us to understand how we have structured the world, and to ask how we can structure it better, not because we may suffer but because others are suffering and that is not how the world should be. What would such a world look like? It would be one that is grounded in the principles of justice and the equitable distribution of resources. An approach to health that is rooted in compassion would help us see beyond ourselves, and place the good of others first. A world rooted in compassion would embrace health as a public good. This means treating health the way we do parks, education, the post office, fire stations, or our environment—in essence, as a crucial piece of the global commons supported by our collective investment for the benefit of all. I recognise that this might seem theoretical, but such an approach would have concrete implications for our approach to health that can shape all our actions, be they in times of crisis, or in other times. In some respects, the current overwhelming investment in doctors and medicine has pushed a vision of health as a private commodity, something we can buy and sell, particularly in countries like the USA that do not have access to universal health care. But what we can buy—health care—can only help us after we have become sick. And what we have been buying in the time of COVID-19 is largely an approach to bludgeon an epidemic into submission, informed by strict prioritisation of the biological imperatives of viral transmission. But our focus should always have been, and more importantly should now be, on building a world that is resilient to these challenges. Our focus should be on health as a state of not being sick to begin with, grounded in an approach that balances the health of all in all our actions. We must recognise that unless we invest in the preventive conditions of health—like safe housing, good schools, liveable wages, gender equity, clean air, drinkable water, and a more equal economy—any action we take during this and any future pandemic is likely to widen entrenched health gaps. And that situation should be unacceptable to all of us. Would our approach to COVID-19 have been different were we accustomed to seeing health through the lens of compassion? I would argue yes. First, we would have long invested in the conditions that make people healthy, aiming to remove the underlying disproportionate burden of preventable illness that accrues to vulnerable populations worldwide. Second, our response to COVID-19 would be informed in equal parts by efforts to contain the spread and to mitigate how the consequences of our efforts to do so can bring about disproportionate harm to those who are removed from the decision making around this pandemic. Third, our response would recognise the global differences that characterise a world that puts the burden of disease squarely on countries with fewer resources, often driven to that condition by centuries of cross-national injustice, and would push us to redouble our efforts to do everything in our power to help those countries, perhaps before our own. Surely this moment calls for careful reflection and a reinvestment in compassion as a foundational approach to health. Calling attention to compassion in this way is not sentimental. It is pointing out a tangible good, without which health for all is impossible. In a sense, COVID-19 has shown us that a healthy person and a healthy world are the same.

Carrabba, Jacopo Peccatori, Consuelo Corti, and others",The Lancet Haematology," After allogeneic transplantation, comprehensive clinical follow-up is recommended for early detection of post-transplantation infections and other common complications such as endocrine disease or metabolic syndrome, and to ensure patients can enjoy quality of life. Long-term follow-up relies on a combination of primary disease monitoring, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) surveillance and treatment, and long-term complications, such as secondary malignancy surveillance. The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started spreading around the world in Feb 2020, presenting an unexpected challenge for transplantation services. In Italy, the first positive patient was identified on Feb 21, 2020, and as of Apr 23, 2020 more than 190 000 people have been diagnosed and over 25 000 have died. Northern Italy, where our stem cell transplantation programme is located, was rapidly overwhelmed. When the first patient with COVID-19 was diagnosed, we were faced with the dilemma of how to minimise the risk of infection while ensuring the delivery of the essential clinical care to our onco-haematological patients who received transplantation with a curative intent and were at high risk of developing clinically significant COVID-19 disease. Could we use telemedicine to follow-up patients after transplantation during the pandemic? Telemedicine can facilitate the interactions between patients, caregivers, and health-care providers, but could it be used to manage transplantation recipients, who are generally frail and have multiple comorbidities? Italy has the privilege of having a national health system (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) since 1978, which relies on three fundamental principles: universality, solidarity, and uniformity. Even though much has been discussed on the potential benefit of telemedicine in the country in the past decade, little has been implemented so far. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has urgently pushed for the need to rethink the classic model of in-person consultations. Within 48 hours from the first COVID-19 diagnosis in Italy, physicians of our long-term follow up clinic organised telephone consultations with transplantation recipients, prioritising contact on the basis of time from transplantation and known individual post-transplantation complications. The first planned telephone call focused on areas of urgent intervention: assessment of signs or symptoms of infection, GVHD, or any signs of organ damage. The suggestion of infections or GVHD symptoms was further investigated through closed-ended questions aimed at identifying warning signs: “have you had dry mouth or difficulty swallowing dry food in the past 4 weeks?”, to address potential oral GVHD; or “have you noticed a dry cough in the past two weeks?”, to address the concern about infections. When visual examination was required (ie, onset of a skin rash), voice-only calls were replaced by video consultations. The consultations were summarised in the patients' electronic medical record. We started a risk versus benefit approach, by which patients who had less than 3 months of follow-up since transplantation and no suspected COVID-19 were all assessed through in-person visits (figure). All patients with suspected COVID-19 were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by nasopharyngeal swab and then managed by a dedicated COVID-multidisciplinary team if positive, or by the transplant physicians if negative. Patients with 3 or more months of follow-up after transplantation who did not have any COVID-19 symptoms were attended via teleconsultation if they did not show signs of transplantation-related complications, while those with organ toxicity or GVHD were assessed in-person.FigurePatient distribution and decision-making flow-chartShow full captionBlue pathway=classic long-term follow-up; red pathway=COVID-19 dedicated follow-up. *Of five COVID-19-positive patients, three were hospitalised and two were followed-up via teleconsultation. †All COVID-19-negative patients were evaluated through an in-person visit.View Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) Blue pathway=classic long-term follow-up; red pathway=COVID-19 dedicated follow-up. *Of five COVID-19-positive patients, three were hospitalised and two were followed-up via teleconsultation. †All COVID-19-negative patients were evaluated through an in-person visit. Between Feb 24 and Mar 31, 2020, we contacted 236 (51%) of the 465 adult patients who received an allogeneic transplantation between Jan 1999 and Jan 2020 in our centre, applying our decision-making criteria (figure) to decide whether in-person visits were required. 14 (6%) patients had a follow-up of less than 3 months from transplantation, 15 (6%) had 3–6 months, 81 (34%) had 6–24 months, and 126 (53%) had more than 24 months follow-up. 50 (40%) of the 126 patients with more than 24 months follow-up were receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic GVHD, being at high risk of complications from infections. 21 (42%) of these 50 patients with chronic GVHD were evaluated in-person and 29 (58%) could be seen via teleconsultations. Of the 81 patients with 6–24 months follow-up, 24 (30%) are still under immunosuppressive therapy for chronic GVHD and 21 of them received an in-person visit at our long-term follow-up clinic. All patients with more than 24 months follow-up received a clinical evaluation since the outbreak started (75 [68%] of 110 patients an in-person visit and 35 [32%] had a teleconsultation). Only 20 (4%) of 465 patients who received a transplantation reported fever and respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19; 17 (85%) of 20 were tested and 5 (25%) were confirmed COVID-19 cases. These patients were treated by a dedicated multidisciplinary team with full clinical resolution. The remaining 229 (49%) of 465 patients—all with a post-transplantation follow-up of more than 2 years—were contacted by e-mail to provide disease-specific information and explain how we were re-organising visits and teleconsultations in the long-term follow-up clinic. Our next step will be to send an email survey to patients asking for feedback and preference between teleconsultations or in-person visits. We are also preparing standarised telephone questionnaires that address all possible complications post-transplantation, including physical function and quality of life, and special sections on the effect of isolation and physical distancing measures during the pandemic. The medical emergency around COVID-19 did not allow our team to discuss important aspects of teleconsultations, such as medical liability or economic compensation for such consultations. The complete definition of the legal and financial framework for this kind of programme is our next challenge. The widespread use of internet connection, smartphones, and devices facilitate access to e-Health technologies. The sponsorship of government agencies would be crucial for the success of e-Health programmes at all levels; among multidisciplinary hospital teams, patients, caregivers, and community health providers. But ultimately, it is up to health care providers to guide patients on the virtuous use of these tools to promote equitable personalised medicine. Our experience shows the feasibility of using telemedicine to maintain a long-term follow-up programme for transplantation patients. Physicians involved in this experience felt confident about the management of patients using teleconsultations, and patients—reassured that they were not left alone while in quarantine—provided positive feedback on our telemedicine approach. This framework was developed out of necessity in the context of COVID-19 but could be fostered in the post pandemic-era through an integrated model of care after transplantation. Similar teleconsultation programmes might be useful for managing patients undergoing intensive treatments in the future, such as those with acute leukemia or lymphoma.

The authors see the decision by the Indian Council of Medical Research, under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to recommend chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine in select groups of contacts at high risk as an abandonment of scientific reasoning in desperate times. We present our counterview on this issue. The safety concerns raised by Rathi and colleagues include haemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and QTc prolongation. The prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in India ranges from 0% to 10%, with heterogenous distribution and incomplete penetrance.2Kumar P Yadav U Rai V Prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in India: an updated meta-analysis.Egypt J Med Hum Genet. 2016; 17: 295-302Google Scholar Haemolysis is not clinically significant when hydroxychloroquine is administered in usual therapeutic doses to individuals with WHO class II and III glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the safety of hydroxychloroquine is well established with prolonged use. Furthermore, a routine electrocardiogram for QTc interval is not essential before hydroxychloroquine initiation in clinical practice and is not recommended in any guidelines. Decades of experience with this drug in autoimmune disorders is enough to allay these fears. Concerns have been raised regarding lack of data on efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A paucity of data is expected in the first wave of a pandemic caused by a novel virus. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have in-vitro activity against the virus. Recently published human trials,4Gautret P Lagier J-C Parola P Hoang VT Meddeb L Mailhe M et al.Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 20.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949Google Scholar along with other unpublished data,5Chen Z Hu J Zhang Z et al.Efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: results of a randomized clinical trial.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 10.)

The pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine, such as its long half-life and high lung concentration (500-times the blood concentration), are ideally suited for use as an agent for prophylaxis.7Liu J Cao R Xu M et al.Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 16Google Scholar The criticisms made by Rathi and colleagues overlook the fact that prophylactic hydroxychloroquine would be targeted to individuals at high risk rather than the general population. Projection of adverse events to the population level causes unjustified alarm. The advisory from the Indian Council of Medical Research includes a section of key considerations that address all such concerns, which have been ignored by Rathi and colleagues. In addition, the argument that there will be a shortage of the drug is not tenable. Production has been ramped up and the Government of India is supplying hydroxychloroquine to more than 50 countries, which has received widespread appreciation. We are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation pandemic, given the scale of morbidity and mortality. The frontline health-care workers are at great risk of infection; in Italy, 20% of the responding health-care workers have been infected.8The LancetCOVID-19: protecting health-care workers.Lancet. 2020; 395: 922Google Scholar A wide variety of therapeutic interventions are being tried in COVID-19 patients, without any evidence but following a prudent approach. We believe that the hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis in selected groups of high-risk contacts is a prudent approach considering the risk–benefit analysis. Implemented as envisaged in the recommendation document from the Indian Council of Medical Research, evidence will be generated for future recommendations.

Clinical data and the timecourse of infection in the two mothers is shown in figure 1. After feeding and nipple disinfection, milk was collected with pumps and stored in sterile containers at 4°C or −20°C until further analysis. We determined viral loads using RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 N and ORF1b-nsp14 genes4Chu DKW Pan Y Cheng SMS et al.Molecular diagnosis of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia.Clin Chem. 2020; 66: 549-555CrossrefPubMedScopus (39)Google Scholar in both whole and skimmed milk (obtained after removal of the lipid fraction). Further details of sample storage and processing are provided in the appendix. Following admission and delivery (day 0), four samples from Mother 1 tested negative (figure 2). By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in milk from Mother 2 at days 10 (left and right breast), 12, and 13. Samples taken subsequently were negative (figure 2). Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 N peaked at 29·8 and 30·4 in whole milk and skimmed milk, respectively, corresponding to 1·32 × 105 copies per mL and 9·48 × 104 copies per mL (mean of both isolations). Since milk components might affect RNA isolation and quantification, viral RNA recovery rates in milk spiked with serial dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 stock were determined. We observed up to 89·2% reduced recovery rate in whole milk and 51·5% in skimmed milk (appendix), suggesting that the actual viral loads in whole milk of Mother 2 could be even higher than detected.Figure 1Timecourse of SARS-CoV-2 infection of two mothers with newborn childrenShow full captionAfter delivery, Mother 1 developed mild COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

However, whether Newborn 2 was infected by breastfeeding or other modes of transmission remains unclear. Further studies of milk samples from lactating women and possible virus transmission via breastfeeding are needed to develop recommendations on whether mothers with COVID-19 should breastfeed.

David Agren reports from Mexico City. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador set out to defend the country's coronavirus czsar Hugo López-Gatell on May 8, in a morning press conference. He described López-Gatell as “honest” and “humanistic”, with “a position in favour of the people, not in favour of mercantilism, which unfortunately also came to predominate during the neoliberal period in everything related to health”. López Obrador, commonly known as AMLO, was referring to the three decades before he took office. He said that in the past some doctors only “looked to enrich themselves”, and that they asked patients “what assets do you have”, rather than “what (condition) you have”. “That's not…Dr López-Gatell”, he said. Doctors quickly denounced the comments, which came as medical staff stopped wearing their uniforms in public. Health workers have been physically assailed by people considering them COVID-19 risks. Some have had bleach thrown on them. “Many of us are risking our lives treating COVID-19 and the president makes remarks that were not appropriate for a president and much less at this time”, said Asisclo de Jesús Villagómez, former president of the Mexican College of Critical Care Medicine. More than 40 medical associations issued statements on May 10 urging AMLO to apologise. It was an unprecedented rebuke from a profession careful with its public pronouncements. Mexico's Health Secretariat did not respond to an interview request from The Lancet. AMLO apologised on May 11, saying he was only speaking of some physicians. His response to accusations from former health secretaries of shortcomings in his government's response has been to raise accusations of corruption in past administrations. However, physicians report routinely paying out of pocket for supplies. Georgina Magaña, a neurointensivist in Mexico City, said she saw early stories on COVID-19 and started purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE). What has subsequently arrived only “augments” her own personal supplies, she said. Staff have protested outside public hospitals, too, over a lack of PPE. Anti-graft group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity found 219 hospitals had reported shortages—ranging from disposable gowns to N95 masks to hand gel—as of May 14. Mexico has implemented “safe-distancing” campaigns, shut schools and universities, and closed non-essential businesses. The government has urged people to “stay home”, although quarantines have not been strictly enforced. Mexico's response has relied heavily on modelling from sentinel surveillance—which reports respiratory disease information from 475 sites across the country—rather than widespread testing. “I don't think testing is a must”, López-Gatell told CNN on May 16. “We will use testing but in a carefully planned manner.” Mexico has done 0·4 tests per 1000 people, ranking last among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. “Mexico is reserving PCR just for the serious patients”, said Xavier Tello, a physician and health-care consultant. “Contacts are not being tested, identified, or traced.” Foreign media outlets have alleged that Mexico is undercounting COVID-19 deaths. López-Gatell has denied hiding any death figures and has projected the true death rate to be more than eight times higher than the officially confirmed figures—not an unusual occurrence in a pandemic, he said. Mexico started reopening in stages on May 18, beginning with 324 municipalities with no COVID-19 cases reported in the past 28 days. Public health experts asked, however, if testing had occurred in those municipalities. “They cannot know [which municipalities to open] with their sampling scheme”, said Malaquías López-Cervantes, public health professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He said sentinel surveillance could provide a national picture, but not one at the state or local level. The Health Secretariat recorded 51 633 COVID-19 cases and 5322 deaths on May 18. “We have been able to flatten the curve”, López-Gatell said on May 16. The pandemic “will lengthen, but serious cases will not overwhelm our hospital capacity”. Even with his controversial comments and COVID-19 approach, AMLO has remained popular, according to polls—and retained the support of many physicians.

On April 7, 2020, it was reported that in the US city of Chicago, where the black population is roughly 30%, nearly 70% of COVID-19 deaths were in this demographic. A report released by the UK Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre on April 17, 2020, showed that 34% of patients in the UK receiving advanced respiratory support were non-white, despite the non-white population nationally being about 14%. That day, the UK Government announced a review into the impact of COVID-19 on black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities. On May 7, 2020, a provisional analysis by the UK Office for National Statistics of NHS England data suggested that, after adjustment for age, some sociodemographic characteristics, and measures of self-reported health and disability, black people were almost twice as likely as white people to have a COVID-19-related death. We don't yet have the full picture of this pandemic. Even so, teasing apart local demographics and infection patterns seems likely to explain at least a portion of the disparities seen to date. 44% of National Health Service medical staff, on the front line of virus exposure, are non-white. In London, one of the worst affected regions of the UK, white British people are in a minority according to the 2011 Census. Socioeconomic factors may well account for some of the disparities, as might racism in health care. However, other far more speculative explanations have also been offered: some medical researchers have raised the possibility that innate genetic differences between racial groups cause the virus to hit some harder than others.

It has become routine in medical research and clinical practice to categorise people by race and ethnicity. While this is no doubt important in identifying demographic groups who might be disadvantaged by unequal treatment and to spot any environmental or social patterns affecting disease prevalence, these categories are also sometimes used to guide research, diagnosis, and treatment in ways that are not necessarily useful. At worst, they may be reinforcing damaging myths about biological differences between groups. In making the case for the possibility of innate biological health differences between groups during the COVID-19 crisis, at least one researcher has pointed to the already-recognised increased risk of hypertension among black people of Afro-Caribbean descent in the UK and the USA. Hypertension is an example of a health condition that has been unambiguously racialised. It is so widely accepted as such that the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend that black patients younger than 55 years with hypertension be given calcium-channel blockers instead of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) inhibitors, which are given to non-black patients under 55 years. What justifies this distinction in treatment on the basis of race? When epidemiologist Jay Kaufman, at McGill University in Canada, and cardiologist and global expert on hypertension Richard Cooper, at Loyola University Chicago in the USA, analysed studies that claimed to see racial differences in responses to ACE inhibitors, they did not find evidence that black or white patients were significantly advantaged by different prescriptions. Their conclusion about the benefit of assigning ACE inhibitors according to race was that from “the point of view of any individual patient, this is not meaningfully better than being assigned by the flip of a coin”. Kaufman and Cooper's research affirmed what has long been known by population geneticists. Humans are a highly homogeneous species, even more so than our closest evolutionary cousin, the chimpanzee. By far the greatest source of human genetic variation is not group differences, but individual differences. This is perhaps why, for all the effort that has been poured into research to prove the long-held hypothesis that racial differences seen in hypertension have a genetic basis, scientists have not found anything consistent in our DNA to support it. More pertinently, when we talk about race we are talking about groups that are socially defined. In the USA, for instance, someone may have just one grandparent of African ancestry but be categorised as black based on appearance. It makes little sense to conduct research around the assumption that a socially defined group could exhibit a genetic difference from another socially defined group when the groups are not biologically defined to begin with. To do so defies logic. It similarly defies logic to assume that all non-white people in the UK, with their diverse geographical ancestries, are so genetically different from white people that they will as a group be more innately affected by COVID-19. We need only look to history to understand how race was constructed and how little grounding it ever had in biology. One reason counter-assumptions persist is that racial categories are such looming presences in our social and cultural lives that we can't imagine they don't have a firmer biological basis. This is not to say that group-level differences do not exist—for example, in certain genetic conditions that run in families—and indeed, such research should not be dismissed if it can yield useful insights. But it must also be remembered that where such variations are seen, they are fuzzy and marginal, and cannot be a reliable guide to the treatment of any one patient. Very often, environmental and social factors are at play rather than biological ones. In the case of hypertension, one dominant risk factor is diet, particularly salt consumption. Alongside other known social risk factors such as physical inactivity and obesity, research looking at hypertension in black Americans suggests that there might also be an association with stress, possibly including the stress associated with racial discrimination. Yet, time and again, I have seen health researchers erroneously invoke social categories as though they are biological ones. At a conference on diversity in clinical trials held in London, UK, I saw an employee from a major pharmaceutical company repeatedly refer to “Latino” as an “ancestral” group. Anyone familiar with the history of the Americas will know that this socially defined group of people with cultural ties to Latin America comprises individuals of hugely diverse ancestries. Even at a stretch it can't be considered a genetically similar group for the purposes of scientific research. Incidents like this have made me wonder whether some well intentioned but misguided medical researchers are keeping race science alive. The temptation to group people by perceived common traits is known in any other sphere of life as stereotyping. I would argue that in medicine there is also a dangerous habit of racial stereotyping. This tendency to treat people in the same social group as similar, to enter into biological essentialism, too easily glosses over the complexities and breadth of individual differences. One possible reason that race keeps being reintroduced into health research is that one of its blue-sky goals is to have personalised medicine so precise that every person's biological profile is perfectly understood, avoiding adverse drug reactions and unnecessary deaths. In the greyer real world in which we don't have all the necessary data to do this, some doctors and researchers instead turn to social categories as proxies. They work on the assumption that certain groups share certain health traits on average, allowing them to roughly gauge the medical requirements of any patient belonging to that group. It feels like a useful step on the road to personalised medicine, some might argue. In my view, it is a fudge. Our social categories have enormous power in society, in dictating how we live and how we are treated by others, but this doesn't mean they have the same significance underneath our skins. When gaps are seen between groups, we must therefore be careful about diagnosing the causes until we have clear evidence. Casual speculation helps nobody. The UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths found in 2018 that black women were five times more likely than white women to die during pregnancy and childbirth. Similar mortality rates have been seen in the USA, not only among black women but also other minorities. Some have wondered whether this might have something to do with black women's bodies being in some way more vulnerable and less able to withstand pregnancy. It has fallen on health professionals working with minority women, such as the brilliant Florida-based midwife Jennie Joseph, to show through on-the-ground work with pregnant women that, simply by improving standards of care, mortality rates can be drastically improved. It is not groups of people that are different, Joseph's work proves, but how those groups are treated. It is racism that kills, not race. Scientists are finally investigating the damaging effects of conscious and unconscious bias on patients, revealing disturbing truths about racism, sexism, and other forms of prejudice in medicine. A review of gender differences in the treatment of chronic pain in 2018 showed that women tend to be taken less seriously than men, and are more easily dismissed as over-sensitive or hysterical. A 2020 study uncovered racial disparities in dementia care in the UK, with Asian dementia patients less likely to be prescribed anti-dementia drugs than white patients. These are not easy facts to confront for doctors and medical researchers who believe they are doing their best for patients. But the persistent habit of essentialising large groups of people in medicine, I would argue, needs to be interrogated. Medical research is not helped by maintaining myths. If race is to be used as a research variable or diagnostic tool, the reasons why need to be clearly articulated and justified, to avoid a reliance on stereotypes rather than on facts.

The public health response was fast and efficient with good governance and effective health-risk communication”, she says. But Singapore's second wave of COVID-19 among migrant workers has exposed wider inequalities. Highlighting the values at the heart of her global health vision, Legido-Quigley says: “We are not doing our job properly in global health if we do not address the circumstances of vulnerable populations, especially among the millions of people that make up the world's migrant population.” Before the COVID-19 pandemic, analysis of health systems and the implications for prevention and management of key health areas including antimicrobial resistance, non-communicable diseases, and mental health were her research priorities. The pandemic has understandably refocused some of the work of her team in Singapore. As a result, she is collaborating with public health colleagues internationally to build in-country profiles of pandemic responses. “This will be crucial to help us establish best practice, and how we can learn to adapt and influence the ability of health systems to respond with appropriate public health strategies in future outbreaks and other public health emergencies”, she explains. Legido-Quigley's career journey owes much to her parents, who instilled the values of education to their five daughters during family life in Barcelona, Spain. She studied sociology at the universities of Barcelona and Reading, UK, followed by a masters in social policy at the University of Edinburgh. But it was her time as a volunteer at an HIV/AIDS hospice in South Africa around the turn of the millennium that heightened Legido-Quigley's desire to work in the academic health and policy arena. “It was a difficult and transforming experience, trying to help dying mothers and their children, before the era of access to antiretroviral therapy”, she says. She moved to London in 2002 for her PhD at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), working extensively on European health systems projects with Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health. This included an analysis of the health system impact of Spain's austerity programme. Having spent the COVID-19 lockdown back in her native country, the impact of Spain's austerity measures has been all too evident. “Any country with depleted public health infrastructure is going to struggle in responding to a pandemic, a sobering message for our future global health security”, she says. The latter part of her time at LSHTM was spent working with the school's Director Peter Piot, with a focus on policy implications of public health research, highlighted by her contributions to the 2015 Defeating AIDS—Advancing Global Health and the 2018 Future of Health in sub-Saharan Africa Lancet Commissions. Legido-Quigley's engaging and caring personality was immediately apparent to McKee, who comments: “The first thing that strikes you about Helena is her concern for others. These include the people she is researching, many of whom are on the margins of society, and her colleagues, especially her junior staff. I'm sure that this has helped her fit so easily into different cultures in Europe and Asia. But Helena is also an extremely talented researcher and has become a role model for others, especially young female health service researchers. I feel extremely privileged to have had her as my doctoral student, and to have continued working with her ever since.” With her current position being shared between the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health in Singapore and LSHTM, Legido-Quigley is collaborating with multidisciplinary teams of academics to research the health, social, and economic impacts of COVID-19 in Asia and Europe. “We are planning one such project for WHO Europe, which will include a focus on where the pandemic has greatest impact, encompassing its effects on vulnerable populations”, she explains. Her other priorities will be the consolidation of her professional passions: mentoring a younger generation of public health researchers and contributing to the women in science and global health agenda; she is currently helping to establish a network for female scientists in Asia as part of the wider global advocacy movement to improve gender equality throughout the scientific community. Legido-Quigley has recently been appointed Editor-in-Chief of Elsevier's new Journal of Migration and Health, and is planning a special issue later this year dedicated to migrant health and the impact of COVID-19. “This is incredibly exciting for me, as the health of migrants is my passion, and no other journal has its main focus on this important component of global health”, she says. Further ahead, she sees a new dialogue on global health governance as a priority, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. “How we redefine global health architecture will have enormous implications for how health systems worldwide can be resilient to future public health emergencies”, she says. Through her membership of the Council of the World Economic Forum, Legido-Quigley is in a prime position to exert her growing influence in global health and the wider sustainable development arena."," May 23, 2020",Closed

Talha Burki reports. On May 15, 2020, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) released provisional figures on deaths involving COVID-19 in the care sector in England and Wales. From March 2 to May 1, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed or suspected in the deaths of 12 526 individuals living in care homes in the two nations. Worrying as these figures are, they only capture official notifications; when taking account of excess mortality, the situation appears even worse. In an average year, the care sector in England and Wales sees roughly 20 000 fewer deaths during March and April than have been recorded in 2020. Once COVID-19 enters a care home, it moves quickly. By the time the first patient displays symptoms, up to half the residents might already be infected. Care homes have found it difficult to obtain adequate quantities of personal protective equipment in a reasonable time, with providers tending to prioritise the National Health Service. A survey by the Alzheimer's Society found that almost half of care homes were not confident in their supply of personal protective equipment; one facility said it had started taping bags over staff members' hands, feet, and hair. There have also been difficulties in getting hold of enough tests. “People have been trying to isolate residents and manage outbreaks without knowing who had the virus; that is an incredibly difficult task”, said Adam Gordon, professor of the care of older people (University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK). According to a report by Sky News, homes had been pressured into receiving patients with COVID-19 from hospitals. Until mid-April, official advice stated that “negative tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home”. It was only on April 28 that the government stipulated that all residents and staff should be tested for the virus. “You had a situation where care homes were forced to bring in people who probably had the virus, they did not have any means of testing, and they did not have the tools to keep people safe”, points out Adelina Comas-Herrera, a research fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK. “It was a toxic combination.” The sector is already facing a staffing crisis. Pay for care home workers tends to hover around minimum wage, despite them performing a similar job to nurses. If they do not work, they do not get paid. That makes choosing to self-isolate a costly decision. The ONS noted that 9039 of the 12 526 deaths involving COVID-19 from March to April occurred within a care home, while 3444 deaths occurred within a hospital. Gordon is not surprised by the disparity. “This is a group of people who are very frail and often have multiple morbidities”, he said. “Many patients in care homes feel that they are coming to the end of their lives; they make a conscious decision not to go to hospital but to receive care within the residential facility, even if that means palliative care”. In the vast majority of registered cases, care home residents who died from COVID-19 had at least one underlying condition, most commonly dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This is hardly surprising; around 80% of residents have some kind of cognitive impairment. Patients may deteriorate so quickly that there is no time to get them to hospital; COVID-19 can kill soon after the initial appearance of symptoms. Comas-Herrera points out that even if the majority of this year's excess deaths in care homes are not directly attributable to infection with SARS-CoV-2, that does not mean they are not a consequence of the pandemic. “COVID-19 has been hugely disruptive; it has affected all aspects of care”, she said. Isolating residents may mitigate the spread of the virus, but it is associated with morbidity of its own. Care homes are built for communal living and staffed accordingly. The lack of supervision places isolated residents at increased risk of injury, particularly from falls, and their mental health might suffer. People with dementia often stop eating if they are depressed, which can hasten death. Besides, it is no small task to persuade people with dementia to stay in their rooms and maintain physical distancing. No-one wants to see caregivers resort to restraining or sedating residents. England and Wales are far from being the only countries struggling with an epidemic of COVID-19 within the care sector. The French death toll is not much smaller (12 511). Care home residents represent around a third of the total number of reported deaths from COVID-19 in England and Wales, which is in line with several countries of similar income levels. “Even nations who have done well to control the overall epidemic, such as Germany and Norway, are seeing a high proportion of deaths among people in long-term care”, said Gordon."," May 23, 2020",Closed

Praise for the heroic work being done by health-care workers to save lives worldwide in dangerous, exhausting conditions is everywhere. But those same workers are often left unprotected by governments and systems that have failed to supply them with enough personal protective equipment (PPE), supplies, and resources to do their jobs. In April alone, there were an estimated 27 COVID-19-related health worker deaths in the USA, 106 in the UK, and 180 in Russia, with tens of thousands of infections. The actual numbers are probably much higher. But essential work extends beyond health care. Although some people have been able to shift their jobs to their homes, millions of workers have jobs that cannot be done at home—not only custodial staff and orderlies in hospitals, but also teachers and child-care workers, grocery clerks and supermarket workers, delivery people, factory and farm workers, and restaurant staff, often without adequate PPE. These people leave their homes to help maintain a semblance of normality for others, at great risk to themselves and their families. What constitutes an essential worker in the USA varies by state, but black and Latino Americans make up a large part of the essential workforce and have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In New York City, over 60% of COVID-19 deaths have been in black and Latino populations. Meat processing plants have become hotspots for transmission, with 700 new cases at a Texas plant on May 16. 81 employees at a Walmart in Massachusetts tested positive for COVID-19 on May 2. Those who would rather quit their jobs than be exposed to a dangerous work situation face a daunting prospect in the USA. 36 million people have filed for unemployment in the past 2 months and quitting a job (even one that is unsafe) would disqualify workers from unemployment insurance benefits. In the UK, 33% (10·6 million people) of the total workforce are deemed key workers according to the Office for National Statistics. Despite a government plan to pay furloughed workers 80% of their salary, many low-wage workers such as cleaners, migrant and seasonal workers, and student labourers might not be eligible. Transport staff have been particularly hard hit. In New York City, 120 employees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) have died due to COVID-19, and nearly 4000 have tested positive. The MTA changed guidance to advise wearing face masks before the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO shifted their guidance, but being exposed to the public, even with adequate PPE, presents dangers. At least 28 London bus drivers have died due to COVID-19, and a UK railway worker, Belly Mujinga, died after being spat on by a passenger who claimed to have COVID-19, leaving behind an 11-year-old daughter. The International Labour Organization has reported that 2·7 billion people—81% of the world's workforce—had been affected by lockdown measures. 61% of workers are from the informal sector, 90% of whom are in low-income and middle-income countries, and social protection measures are often inadequate, with a lack of access to health-care support and economic protections. Informal and migrant workers are likely to fall through the cracks and ensuring their safety must be a priority. Some US states are considering reopening restaurants, bars, gyms, and swimming pools, without a viable system in place to test, trace, and isolate people, and a CDC draft plan to lift the lockdown has been watered down by the Trump administration. In Germany, infection rates rose as lockdown restrictions began to ease and in the UK Boris Johnson's vague, amorphous plan to end lockdown has caused confusion and angered many. Gifted with a 2-month lockdown and a chance to lay the groundwork for a staged, successful reopening, many western leaders have instead prevaricated, shifted blame, and appear not to grasp the dangers of lifting lockdown without robust testing and mitigation strategies in place. The rush towards a premature, ill-advised end to the lockdown risks a second wave of infections that could surpass the first, and essential workers who never got a chance to isolate and consider their health during the first wave will face the greatest risk to their lives. When this pandemic has ended, we cannot allow a return to the status quo ante. We must ensure that essential workers can do their jobs safely, and that they have adequate health care and paid sick leave to safeguard their health beyond extraordinary pandemics. Essential workers are just that—essential—and by protecting their health, we protect the health and wellbeing of us all.

On the first day of the first-ever virtual World Health Assembly, held during the worst acute global health crisis since WHO's creation in 1948, Alex Azar, US Secretary of Health and Human Services, further damaged the credibility of the US Government as a constructive member of the international community. “We must be frank”, he began. What followed was an astonishing series of unsubstantiated allegations. “There was a failure by this organisation”, Azar stated. He argued that WHO had conspired with a member state (he meant China) “in an apparent attempt to conceal this outbreak”. He accused WHO of unjustly blocking Taiwan's participation at the World Health Assembly. And he said “WHO must change.” It must be more transparent and more accountable. Earlier, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus gave a forceful defence of the agency. He accepted that “we all have lessons to learn”, but argued that WHO had stood “shoulder-to-shoulder with countries”. The agency had acted quickly, Tedros said. He promised to initiate an “independent evaluation” of the global response. “The world must never be the same.” There was no need for new plans, procedures, or institutions. What mattered now was to strengthen existing mechanisms, especially national public health capacities specified in the 2005 International Health Regulations. Investing in health was a prerequisite for development. To protect the world from future pandemics, Tedros called on member states to support a stronger WHO. In the speeches that followed, countries repeatedly backed WHO and the Director-General. China stressed that it acted in a timely, open, transparent, and responsible manner. Some countries went further, denouncing the unilateral and coercive actions of the US Government.

Overnight, President Trump wrote an explosive letter to WHO's Director-General. He claimed that “the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly to the world…if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization. I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America's interests.” But the basis for his accusations is dubious at best. In his letter, President Trump reports the results of a review his administration conducted into WHO's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He wrote that “we know the following”. The first allegation he makes is that WHO “consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal. The World Health Organization failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government's official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself.” This statement is factually incorrect.

The first reports the journal published were on Jan 24, 2020. In a paper by Chaolin Huang and colleagues, the first 41 patients from Wuhan with COVID-19 were described. The scientists and physicians who led this study were all from Chinese institutions. They worked with us closely, collaboratively, and quickly to make information about this new epidemic outbreak and disease fully and freely available to an international audience. A second paper, from Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan and colleagues, also published on Jan 24, described the first scientific evidence confirming person-to-person transmission of the new virus. This report included scientists and physicians from Hong Kong and mainland China. The allegations levelled against WHO in President Trump's letter are serious and damaging to efforts to strengthen international cooperation to control this pandemic. It is essential that any review of the global response is based on a factually accurate account of what took place in December and January. It is regrettable that President Trump's letter fell short of these standards. He should retract his letter, correct the record, and withdraw his allegations against WHO.

High-income and upper-middle-income countries have borne the brunt of deaths associated with COVID-19 so far, and they are now seeing diminishing mortality rates. Countries across the world are easing lockdown restrictions. But, as this UNICEF paper outlines, for populations least affected by the disease itself, but for whom food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition are already prevalent and critical problems, the worst might be yet to come. The Global Nutrition Report launched this month, with the bleak headline finding that one in nine people is hungry or malnourished. In 2018, almost a quarter of the world's children younger than 5 years, 149·0 million children, were stunted and 7·3% (49·5 million children) were wasted. Progress over the past few years has been minimal and remains far from the 2025 global nutrition targets: to reduce childhood stunting to fewer than 100 million children and childhood wasting to 5% or less. Now, in light of current global events, tackling malnutrition is expected to become harder still. On April 20, the 2020 Global Report on Food Crises was published, describing the factors that have led to a perfect storm for a food crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the report, armed conflict remains a key driver of food insecurity in the region, disrupting agriculture and trade, blocking supply chains, and prompting mass population displacement. Exacerbating the situation since last June, unusually heavy rains have facilitated the development of locust swarms, devastating crops across east Africa. Movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 crisis are delaying delivery of pesticides and stationing of staff to address the problem. Moreover, reports indicate that, where farmers can grow crops, lockdown restrictions are regularly preventing them from transporting produce and livestock to markets, and that rice imports to sub-Saharan Africa that were intended to compensate for the shortfall have been disrupted or stopped, driving up prices of this staple food. Finally, wage losses resulting from government-imposed shelter-in-place orders are further restricting the purchasing power of many families who were already on the borderline of poverty: an African Union study has projected that up to 20 million jobs could be lost in the region due to the COVID-19 crisis. The Global Report on Food Crises estimates that 135 million people were food insecure in 2019, but more recent World Food Programme (WFP) projections indicate that, because of the economic effects of and supply chain disruptions associated with COVID-19, this number could double in 2020, to 265 million people. In announcing these projections, WFP Executive Director David Beasley warned: “if we don't prepare and act now—to secure access, avoid funding shortfalls and disruptions to trade—we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months.” Women and, particularly, children could bear the brunt of the effects of food insecurity, as well as COVID-19-associated health system disruptions. In their Article in The Lancet Global Health, Timothy Roberton and colleagues estimate the effects of these disruptions on maternal and under-5 child deaths in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. They find that even a small reduction in coverage and use of maternal and child health services could lead to 42 240 additional child deaths and 2030 additional maternal deaths per month, with worst-case scenario disruptions potentially resulting in an excess 1 157 000 child deaths and 56 700 maternal deaths over 6 months. These indirect effects will reach far beyond the disease itself, with long-term social and economic consequences for individuals and society. How can we prepare for this impending humanitarian disaster? In March, the UN set up the US$2 billion COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, to enable agencies such as WHO, UNICEF, and the WFP to provide food, water and sanitation, and vaccinations, as well as COVID-19 testing materials and medical equipment, to the most vulnerable communities. At the time of writing, it had only received 46% of the required amount. Fully funding this appeal should be an urgent priority for donors, even as they struggle with economic shocks of their own. Additionally, restrictions on transport and trade should be considered in the wider context of their potentially devastating effects on food supply chains. To paraphrase David Beasley, leaders should be acutely alert to the potential for an infectious disease pandemic to be compounded by a pandemic of undernutrition.

Interruptions in supply chains with subsequent stock-outs of antiretrovirals and closure of sexual health clinics and counselling services are already affecting the HIV response in some countries. Correspondence in this issue describes how drug shortages are affecting the HIV response in Indonesia. Many governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have responded with innovative strategies to counter the lockdown, including multimonth dispensing of antiretrovirals, online clinics and support networks, and postal testing for sexually transmitted infections. However, there have been worrying reports about countries and regions abusing the rights of key populations affected by HIV/AIDS under the pretext of COVID-19 regulations. In Egypt, Human Rights Watch (HRW) report that people with HIV are afraid to collect their antiretroviral prescriptions since government infectious disease hospitals, the only centres for HIV treatment, have been designated COVID-19 centres. Provision of HIV services by trusted NGOs has been resisted by government and multimonth prescribing is not encouraged. Also widely reported in the media is the plight of 19 young people staying at a shelter for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people in Kampala, Uganda, who were arrested, beaten, and questioned on their sexual behaviour. They were charged with disobeying COVID-19 regulations on social distancing but were not detained under Uganda's anti-homosexuality law. After 50 days detention, the charges were dropped and the 19 people were released after mounting pressure from human rights groups. Some of those detained have HIV and had no access to their medication during detention. UNAIDS have reported crackdowns against sex workers, including home raids, compulsory COVID-19 testing, arrests, and threatened deportation of migrant sex workers. Criminalised in most jurisdictions, lockdown and social distancing have decimated their livelihoods, and police harassment and criminal penalties endanger sex workers' health. Many government-led social protection schemes have excluded sex workers. Transgender populations have also been impacted by a lack of societal care in many countries. Since lockdown, there have been reports of murders of transgender people in Puerto Rico. And HRW has reported that transgender people (hijra) in Bangladesh, who are poorly provisioned for at the best of times, have little access to food and medication and there are doubts that there will be equitable distribution of emergency resources to this group. Homeless populations too have been severely affected—for example, in Minsk, Belarus, the number of homeless shelters has reduced from 11 to three, reducing the support available for this group, some of whom are living with HIV. Some governments have taken advantage of the COVID-19 emergency to pass laws blatantly penalising some key populations. Hungary passed a law to remove the right of people to change their gender and name to conform with their gender identity; and Poland fast-tracked an update to criminal law that increases the penalties for HIV exposure, non-disclosure, and transmission. UNAIDS and the European Parliament both rightly condemned the abuse of emergency powers in the two countries. Discrimination against the LGBTI community in South Korea threatens the COVID-19 response. Lauded for its approach to containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the country's tracking and tracing of people linked to an outbreak at a gay nightclub in Seoul has led to an anti-gay backlash, in a country with already entrenched homophobic attitudes. Concerns are that those affected will not get tested for COVID-19 for fear of being outed. The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the previous inequalities for key populations affected by HIV, and emergency laws have increased stigma and discrimination. As with the HIV epidemic, a human rights-based approach is the key to combatting the COVID-19 epidemic, and many lessons can be learned from the HIV experience. Countries must take effective and proportionate responses to COVID-19, but it is unacceptable that the most vulnerable in society are left behind and, in some cases, targeted and criminalised by governments and their agencies. Indeed, infringement of rights, abuse, stigmatisation, and criminalisation does nothing but alienate already vulnerable populations when their engagement with services is crucial. COVID-19 must not become a cover for the rolling back of hard won rights in the fight against HIV. Evolving ART crisis for people living with HIV in IndonesiaFull-TextPDF"," May 21, 2020",Closed
DOI:10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30287-4,News,COVID-19: consequences for higher education,/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(20)30287-4/fulltext,https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30287-4,10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30287-4,Talha Khan Burki,The Lancet Oncology," The COVID-19 pandemic has already cost UK universities an estimated £790 million. The shutdown has meant that accommodation, catering, and conference income has evaporated. A similar situation is evolving in the USA. In the 2017 fiscal year, the US higher education sector earned about US$44·6 billion in so-called auxiliary revenues, such as bookstores, halls of residence, and summer camps. The figure for this year is likely to be nearer $30 billion. Meanwhile, Australia expects its higher education sector to lose somewhere in the region of AUS$3–4·6 billion for the 2019–20 academic year. Universities worldwide have been forced rapidly to scale up online teaching, which has typically entailed unexpected expenditure. They have had to find money to continue paying their staff, as well as deep-cleaning facilities and mothballing research projects. Yet, sizeable as the losses are for the current academic year, they could easily be dwarfed by those expected next year. The economic downturn will force thousands of youngsters to defer entering university. More than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April 2020 alone. Students from outside the UK and EU contribute about £6·9 billion in yearly fees to British universities. Encouraged by successive governments, who wished to bolster commercial education, institutions have come to rely on this money, which represents about a third of the total income from tuition fees. A collapse in the international student market, which seems inevitable, would have serious consequences. Australia is similarly exposed. Its higher education sector hosts more 300 000 students from overseas. Terry Hartle (Vice-President of the American Council on Education, Washington, DC, USA) expects international enrolments in US universities and colleges to fall by at least a quarter in 2020–21. Prospective students might also be put off by the physical distancing requirements that are likely to prevail on university campuses for the foreseeable future. Much will depend on the dynamics of the pandemic. “We really do not have a handle on what will happen when it comes to September”, said Hartle. “Very few schools in the USA are certain that they will be able to open on time.” The shift to online learning looks set to continue at least until the advent of a successful vaccine for COVID-19. This situation raises questions about whether institutions can justify a fee structure predicated on a model of face-to-face contact. “Students generally report that university is much more than just tuition—place is also really important”, said Simon Marginson (Professor of Higher Education at the University of Oxford, Oxford, UK). “If students are going to miss half of what usually constitutes the student experience, are they really receiving the same value for money?” Furthermore, online learning is no substitute for laboratory work. Moreover, recessions diminish the prospects for graduate employment. “You have a downgrading of the student experience and a downgrading of the value of the degree; I think it is going to be difficult for universities to sustain the same level of fees that they have been”, said Marginson. It could easily add up to a perfect storm: weakening of domestic and international demand coupled with pressure to decrease fees. “Without any action, universities will be forced to make huge cuts, jobs will be lost, and vital research will be halted”, a spokesperson for Universities UK, an umbrella group representing 137 institutions, told The Lancet Oncology. “Pretty much every university in the country is looking at voluntary redundancies”, added Malcolm Reed (Dean of Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK, and Co-Chair of the Medical Schools Council, London, UK). “A lot of staff on short-term contracts are likely to go, and funding for PhDs is looking very precarious because of the impact on charities; our pool of future researchers is going to be shallower.” Prestigious research institutions, such as Harvard (Cambridge, MA, USA) or Oxford (UK) universities, are well placed to weather the coming storm. But places that fall lower down the league tables are vulnerable, especially if international student fees form a big part of their income. “For the most part, medical schools and high-quality research will be ring-fenced from changes”, said Marginson. “Medicine and life sciences are very strong in the UK system; I am confident that they will survive when other things go down”. Much will depend on the depth of the downturn. Reed points out that medical schools are integrated within the university's wider economy. “If the university is under threat, so is the medical school”, he said. Clinical placements for UK medical students in their penultimate year have been suspended since March. Reed hopes that if they are able to restart by September, the lost ground can be recovered. But any further delay would be problematic. “There is no simple answer as to how to deal with students who have missed 6 months of their clinical experience”, said Reed. “It would be a real threat to graduating on time next year”. As The Lancet Oncology went to press, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide was approaching 5 million. In the absence of substantial financial support, many of the world's colleges and universities are unlikely to survive the pandemic. Others will have to shut down large projects or sell property. “This is an epochal event”, said Hartle. “It is going to leave a huge impression on the education sector.” View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Ruth Swan/Shutterstock.com View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Ruth Swan/Shutterstock.com"," May 21, 2020",Closed

Anakinra is an immunosuppressive drug that carries the theoretical risk of harm in the wrong patient group by potentially targeting beneficial inflammation; however, positive effects might also be missed if the correct patient group is not ascertained. It is important, therefore, to target treatment to individuals considered to have hyperinflammation. Diagnostic criteria in this patient group are poorly developed and there is no consensus, as seen from the inclusion criteria listed for the ongoing anakinra trials (table). Although serum ferritin and IL-6 concentrations are highly specific to hyperinflammation and have been shown to be associated with a need for ventilation in patients with COVID-19,8Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (401)Google Scholar they are not routinely measured in the clinical setting, a shortcoming that is highly relevant given the requirement to identify as many patients as possible that might benefit. We suggest a pragmatic approach to patient selection based on identifying patients with progressive disease and evidence of increasing inflammation. Therefore, we propose using worsening lymphopenia, a marker of disease progression and severity in COVID-19, and increasing C-reactive protein as evidence of worsening inflammation. The dose and route of administration of anakinra is especially relevant given its short plasma half-life, with both intravenous and subcutaneous routes being considered.6Aouba A Baldolli A Geffray L et al.Targeting the inflammatory cascade with anakinra in moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia: case series.Ann Rheum Dis. 2020;  (published online May 6.)DOI:10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217706CrossrefGoogle Scholar,  7Cavalli G De Luca G Campochiaro C et al.Interleukin-1 blockade with high-dose anakinra in patients with COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and hyperinflammation: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet Rheumatology. 2020;  (published online May 7.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2665-9913(20)30127-2SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFGoogle Scholar While a short half-life is beneficial in limiting the drug's duration of action in case of adverse events, it also leads to large peak–trough fluctuations with an intravenous formulation. Variation in dosing needs to be minimised to ensure constant and adequate bioavailability, and to avoid a detrimental rebound increase of inflammation. Pharmacokinetic studies in various disease states have shown that subcutaneous anakinra might ensure adequate and consistent plasma concentrations, with bioavailability ranging from 80–95%.9Yang BB Baughman S Sullivan JT Pharmacokinetics of anakinra in subjects with different levels of renal function.Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2003; 74: 85-94CrossrefPubMedScopus (57)Google Scholar,  10Yang BB Gozzi P Sullivan JT Pharmacokinetics of anakinra in subjects of heavier vs. lighter body weights.Clin Transl Sci. 2019; 12: 371-378CrossrefPubMedScopus (0)Google Scholar Concerns have been raised regarding the suitability of subcutaneous drug administration in patients in intensive care because they are susceptible to the development of peripheral oedema and poor skin perfusion. Repeated subcutaneous injections might also lead to patient discomfort. However, these downsides should be weighed against the considerable benefits of subcutaneous administration in the context of this pandemic, which include easy administration by any health-care professional, increased cost-effectiveness with no need for infusion pumps or equivalent, and reduced fluid load. Reduced fluid load is important as current guidelines for management of severe ARDS recommend a negative fluid balance of 0·5–1·0 L per day,11Matthay MA Aldrich JM Gotts JE Treatment for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19.Lancet Respir Med. 2020; 8: 433-434SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (9)Google Scholar and the most commonly adopted mode of intravenous anakinra results in infusion of a minimum of 400 mL of fluid. Another important consideration is the choice of how to record the success (or otherwise) of the intervention. It is rare for single trials to provide definitive answers, so a core set of outcomes that are reported by all trials of a given intervention are important to allow systematic reviewers to combine results in similar patient populations.12Williamson PR Altman DG Bagley H et al.The COMET handbook: version 1·0.Trials. 2017; 18: 280CrossrefPubMedScopus (0)Google Scholar Of the ten identified trials (table), six trials consider patients with a severe condition. These trials are dominated by the REMAP-CAP trial (NCT02735707), which has an open-ended recruitment and a target of 7100 patients. The other five trials have a total of fewer than 400 participants receiving anakinra, with no outcome common to all. Some trials focus on effectiveness (clinical) and others on efficacy (biomarker) endpoints. The other four trials include patients with less severe disease but who are hospitalised, with total recruitment around 250 participants. These trials have a similar mix of effectiveness and efficacy endpoints, with mortality being the most commonly reported outcome. Only five trials explicitly mention ferritin as an outcome, which is regarded as an important parameter for assessing hyperinflammation, and these trials will report data in different ways that will preclude pooling. Even without the clinical heterogeneity inherent in the range of eligibility criteria and dosing regimens under study (table), power for meaningful meta-analysis will be low. Anakinra is a highly plausible drug candidate in COVID-19, but we encourage trialists to consider patient selection, dosing, and outcome measures, and, importantly, to ensure collection of core outcome measures for current and future trials.

Fortunately, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, was isolated and propagated early on in the pandemic using numerous in-vitro models, such as Vero cells, Huh7 cells, and human airway epithelial cells. This isolation was enhanced after SARS-CoV-2 was isolated and propagated in TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells, indicating the vital role of TMPRSS2 serine protease in virus infectivity.5Matsuyama S Nao N Shirato K et al.Enhanced isolation of SARS-CoV-2 by TMPRSS2-expressing cells.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020; 117: 7001-7003CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Thus, in-vitro models are effective in the study of virus propagation, but they poorly recapitulate respiratory tract histology and function. We recommend the use of human airway organoids as a model to study SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics, tropism, and host response (figure). Airway organoids can be generated using healthy lung tissue derived from patients undergoing surgical resection, and SARS-CoV-2 can be obtained from clinical specimens from patients who have tested positive. After the airway organoid is infected with SARS-CoV-2, immunofluorescence and electron scanning microscopes could be used to study the cytopathic effects of viral particles on different cell types. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR could determine viral replication kinetics and genetic alterations, and transcriptomic profiling could reveal the differential expression of genes related to viral infection. Additionally, flow cytometry enables the detection and quantification of different cell types before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.FigureCo-culture of airways organoidsShow full captionCo-culture of airways organoids with SARS-CoV-2 could be used to study viral replication, tropism, and pathogenicity in addition to structural changes (A); study immune responses and cytokine release, recapitulate some pathological conditions such as cytokine release syndrome, and develop immunomodulatory drugs (B); and as a tool for antiviral drug discovery and development (C).

Moreover, genomic and transcriptomic profiling could reveal further signalling pathways involved in such immune responses. It is also possible to detect the secreted cytokines in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and hence provide a model to recapitulate cytokine release syndrome seen in some patients with COVID-19.8Shi Y Wang Y Shao C et al.COVID-19 infection: the perspectives on immune responses.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27: 1451-1454CrossrefPubMedScopus (11)Google Scholar Moreover, a co-culture model could be used to explore the activity of immunomodulatory drugs.

However, randomised clinical trials for both therapies have since failed to show benefit.2van Griensven J Edwards T de Lamballerie X et al.Evaluation of convalescent plasma for Ebola virus disease in Guinea.N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 33-42CrossrefPubMedScopus (137)Google Scholar,  3The PREVAIL II Writing GroupA randomized, controlled trial of ZMapp for Ebola virus infection.N Engl J Med. 2016; 375: 1448-1456CrossrefPubMedScopus (191)Google Scholar Why, then, did so many more Americans survive if not due to preferential access to experimental therapies? The likely answer is the Americans survived not due to preferential access to unproven therapies but to proven ones. 5 years later, the world is facing another, much larger, pandemic, and we worry the medical community has not learned from this recent experience. To be clear, searching for effective new therapies against COVID-19 is highly important. At the same time, we must remain cognisant that the odds are stacked against the candidates. Medications that decrease mortality are difficult to come by, leaving numerous diseases without direct remedies. Influenza provides an important perspective. Scientists have been searching for a cure since before the 1918 influenza pandemic, and more than 100 years later our best medicines for influenza merely shorten the duration of symptoms by a day at best.4Jefferson T Jones MA Doshi P et al.Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in adults and children.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014; 4CD008965PubMedGoogle Scholar None has been shown to reduce mortality. Influenza is not unique; sepsis has been subjected to decades of research resulting in a much advanced understanding of the syndrome's pathobiology. However, hundreds of therapeutic candidates with biological plausibility, from stem cells to vitamin C, have not consistently improved patient outcomes. Of course, a lack of targeted therapies does not mean a patient with the 1918 influenza would not fare better today, or that someone with sepsis is not better off in 2020 than before the Surviving Sepsis campaign of 2002. Just like the Americans evacuated home during the Ebola epidemic, access to modern medicine's supportive care toolbox—frequent laboratory assessments with correction of metabolic derangements, precise haemodynamic monitoring and support, lung protective mechanical ventilation, and dialysis, among others—would have saved countless lives. Although these everyday interventions have not received the same attention as novel therapeutic strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, their value is informed by decades of evidence. As with influenza, Ebola, and sepsis, the timely delivery of standard and supportive care will probably save more patients from COVID-19 in the months ahead than any of the unproven, and potentially dangerous, pharmacological therapies being both formally trialled and individually tried today. Hydroxychloroquine, for example, was widely used early in the pandemic on the basis of reports of a potential benefit. More recent assessment has called its use into question and even suggested harm. Rather than ruminating about which innovative therapeutic might help a given patient, our collective mental energy is better spent on guaranteeing the delivery of evidence-based care against COVID-19's main killers. In 2000, the ARDS Network discovered that use of small tidal volumes reduced absolute mortality by 9%—the first intervention shown to improve outcomes since acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first described 33 years earlier.5The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome NetworkVentilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with traditional tidal volumes for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.N Engl J Med. 2000; 342: 1301-1308CrossrefPubMedScopus (7881)Google Scholar Subsequent trials have shown an additional 17% absolute risk reduction for patients with moderate and severe ARDS when managed in the prone position.6Guérin C Reignier J Richard J-C et al.Prone positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.N Engl J Med. 2013; 368: 2159-2168CrossrefPubMedScopus (1122)Google Scholar Furthermore, a conservative fluid management strategy can decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation and onset of other organ dysfunction.7The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials NetworkComparison of two fluid-management strategies in acute lung injury.N Engl J Med. 2006; 354: 2564-2575CrossrefPubMedScopus (2068)Google Scholar Other strategies have been shown to prevent ARDS, including the conservative use of blood products, early identification and treatment of sepsis, default use of lung protective ventilation, and intensivist involvement. Despite these decades of data and agreed-upon standard of care for ARDS, many have suggested—via journal articles, medical blogs, news sites, and social media—that several of these standards should be abandoned in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19. It has been argued that COVID-19 causes a form of ARDS which is different from what is claimed to be traditional or typical ARDS and therefore should be treated differently. The evidence supporting these claims is poor or absent. For example, a common refrain is that patients with ARDS from COVID-19 have higher lung compliance and worse oxygenation than traditional ARDS. However, published compliance data from patients with ARDS from COVID-19 are largely consistent with data from ARDS trials predating the pandemic. Furthermore, the few published and preprint tissue analyses available from both biopsy and autopsy specimens show diffuse alveolar damage as is typically seen in ARDS from other causes. Similarly, while much attention has been paid to the presence of extensive pulmonary microthrombosis in patients with ARDS from COVID-19, the same observation was made in ARDS more than 30 years ago. It is certainly possible, and perhaps even likely, that ARDS from COVID-19 has unique features, just as ARDS from pneumonia, pancreatitis, and gastric aspiration probably have unique features. By definition ARDS is a syndrome, not a disease. While disentangling subtypes of ARDS is an active and promising field, the bulk of clinical trial data to date come from patients with ARDS of varying causes, including viral pneumonias. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, proven therapies for ARDS (low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and conservative fluid strategy) should remain the standard of care for all patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. As clinicians caring for patients dying from COVID-19, we too yearn for a novel therapy for this novel disease. We also recognise and appreciate the scientific value of expert observations. Indeed, they are crucial to identify aspects of management where there truly is equipoise and thus indication for rigorous study. Prompt collection of such data must be prioritised so we will be armed with appropriate evidence to fight the inevitable second surge when it arrives. History tells us a pandemic is not a justification to abandon the basic principles of evidence-based medicine. In fact, adhering to these values has never been more important.

The COVID-19 outbreak is emotionally challenging for everyone, especially for individuals who are already at risk (eg, those suffering from depression). During and following the COVID-19 outbreak and the outcomes of isolation and quarantine, we might see an increase in suicide ideation and behaviour among at-risk populations.4Chan S Chiu F Lam C Leung P Conwell Y Elderly suicide and the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong.Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2006; 21: 113-118CrossrefPubMedScopus (19)Google Scholar Whether this increase will be in the short or long term (or both) remains unclear, but the mental health community should be prepared and can use this challenging period to advance suicide prevention. First, people are currently more able than in the past to talk about depression, anxiety, and suicide ideation. It appears that sharing experiences of negative emotions carries less stigma than it used to. Moreover, death has become a topic that all ages can more readily talk about, and it might be easier for people and mental health providers to ask directly about suicide risk. Second, people now understand the importance of social support in times of crises and tend to agree that it saves lives. Finally, people at risk for suicide can now get psychological help online, which might be more accessible for various reasons (eg, because of reduced stigma and removal of transportation or time barriers). The medical community needs to make sure that online providers can assess suicide risk and provide specific suicide prevention interventions.5Stanley B Brown G Safety planning intervention: a brief intervention to mitigate suicide risk.Cogn Behav Pract. 2012; 19: 256-264CrossrefScopus (280)Google Scholar Mental health providers should now directly convey to every patient that in any case of severe crises, they should not hurt themselves. It has always been our priority as mental health providers to reinforce to our patients that there is always hope and that there are several solutions to any problem. The challenge of the COVID-19 outbreak might bring with it an opportunity to advance the field of suicide prevention and thus to save lives. These suicide prevention efforts should be integrated into the overall reaction programme for dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. I declare no competing interests."," May, 2020",Closed

What makes the current attacks specifically horrifying is that health-care personnel are responding to a crisis that is deeply affecting all societies. Governmental failures in some countries to adequately provide and manage resources in this pandemic mean that health-care personnel are risking their lives daily by caring for COVID-19 patients without adequate personal protective equipment and other safety measures in their workplaces.7Horton R Coronavirus is the greatest global science policy failure in a generation.The Guardian. April 9, 2020; Google Scholar As a result, thousands of health-care workers worldwide have contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have thus been perceived as public health hazards themselves.8Mantovani C 90 000 healthcare workers infected with COVID-19: nurses group.Reuters World News. May 6, 2020; Google Scholar This situation has generated violence against them in some places, essentially for performing their professional duties. This response is likely to exacerbate already unprecedented COVID-19-related stress and burnout that health-care workers and their families are experiencing in this pandemic. With the COVID-19 pandemic taxing the health-care systems of almost every country, assaults on health-care workers are assaults against all of us. We depend on their health and wellbeing so that they can continue to provide care to individuals, families, and communities with and without COVID-19. The reasons people attack and abuse health-care personnel during health emergencies are many, and local contexts vary. In some settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, fear, panic, misinformation about how SARS-CoV-2 can spread, and misplaced anger are likely drivers. A few government leaders have responded by announcing swift and, in some cases, draconian punishment for those who attack health-care workers.9The Economic TimesCabinet okays ordinance to protect frontline workers.The Economic Times. April 22, 2020; Google Scholar Yet threats of retribution do not address the causes of such violence and alone are unlikely to curtail these attacks. Effective responses must address the root causes. We recommend that the following actions be taken immediately. First, collect data on the incidence and types of attacks on health-care personnel, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in all countries to fully understand the scope of the problem and to design interventions to prevent and respond to the attacks. National and international bodies such as WHO must engage in a coordinated global effort. And this initiative must incorporate lessons learned from previous efforts to document violence against health-care personnel, such as attacks on those leading polio vaccination campaigns or who cared for patients with Ebola virus disease.10Burke J Ebola health workers killed and injured by rebel attack in Congo.The Guardian. Nov 28, 2019; Google Scholar Data on attacks specific to COVID-19 should be systematically gathered and included in the WHO Surveillance System of Attacks on Healthcare. Global support from all member states and their communities for this effort is essential to achieve a robust surveillance system. National data should be collected by ministries of health or occupational health and safety bodies. Mechanisms to analyse, share, and widely disseminate this information on violence against health-care personnel need to be developed or expanded, following the example of the reports from the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition11Safeguarding Health in Conflict CoalitionImpunity remains: attacks on health care in 23 countries in conflict.https://www.safeguardinghealth.org/sites/shcc/files/SHCC2019final.pdfDate: May, 2019Date accessed: May 3, 2020Google Scholar and data gathered by Insecurity Insight,12Insecurity InsightAttacks on health care.http://insecurityinsight.org/projects/healthcareDate: 2020Date accessed: May 16, 2020Google Scholar among others.

Partnerships for the prevention of violence must be forged. Local and state governments must partner with civil society, community-based groups, and media organisations to highlight the problem of attacks on health-care workers and engage with the community on prevention, bystander intervention, and reporting. The Health Care in Danger team of the International Committee of the Red Cross, for example, recently published a checklist for preventing violence against health-care workers in the COVID-19 response, which includes recommendations for communication and collaboration.13International Committee of the Red CrossSafer COVID-19 response: checklist for health-care services.https://healthcareindanger.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4469_002_Safer_COVID-19_Response-Checklist_for_Health-care_Services-Lr_1.pdfDate: May, 2020Date accessed: May 16, 2020Google Scholar Third, misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 must be countered. Widespread misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19, including conspiracy theories, have contributed to the demonisation of certain groups such as health-care workers.14Beaumont P Borger J Boffey D Malicious forces creating “perfect storm” of coronavirus disinformation.The Guardian. April 24, 2020; Google Scholar Governments, international collaborative bodies, and social media companies must further refine and expand effective public information campaigns to keep members of the public informed and educated and to correct misinformation. These should include clear and concise information on how SARS-CoV-2 is and is not spread and the science behind response measures. In the face of high levels of community distrust in many places, active engagement of key trusted community stakeholders and organisations in information campaigns will also be essential for success. Fourth, accountability is needed. We must demand strong yet responsible enforcement actions against perpetrators of attacks by local and national governments. Violence against health-care personnel should be met with swift responses from law enforcement and legal systems. Local law enforcement authorities must fully investigate each reported incident, with an objective, evidence-based process. Full accountability for these crimes must be ensured and perpetrators must be held accountable. Fifth, state and local governments should invest in health security measures to protect health-care workers as part of COVID-19 emergency budgets. Funding for the protection of health-care personnel and health facilities is needed now. Finally, health professional associations, societies, and organisations from all specialties and disciplines should unite in speaking out forcefully against all acts of discrimination, intimidation, and violence against health-care workers.15International Council of NursesICN calls for government action to stop attacks on nurses at a time when their mental health and wellbeing are already under threat because of COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.icn.ch/news/icn-calls-government-action-stop-attacks-nurses-time-when-their-mental-health-and-wellbeingDate: April 29, 2020Date accessed: May 3, 2020Google Scholar They must immediately condemn violence when it occurs and participate in initiatives aimed at responding to and eliminating violence. These actions must be taken now.

Many factors could have a role in this disparity, including differences in proportion of elderly people in a population, general health, accessibility and quality of healthcare, and socioeconomic status. One mostly overlooked factor that could influence outcome of COVID-19 is the relative vitamin D status of populations. Because people are advised to stay at home as much as possible, the government health agencies of Great Britain have recommended that people take vitamin D supplements through summer and autumn during this pandemic. Vitamin D supplementation could be especially important for older people as they are at high risk of poor outcome from COVID-19 and of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D has a well-characterised role in calcium and phosphate balance, affecting bone growth and turnover. Low vitamin D status is also associated with other non-communicable diseases and with increased susceptibility to infectious disease; notably, upper respiratory tract infections. However, whether low vitamin D levels are a cause or consequence of disease has remained a point of heated debate. Intervention trials have rarely shown benefits of vitamin D supplementation as treatments or preventive measures. However, one important exception to this general trend is for upper respiratory tract infections: a 2017 meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 321 participants in 25 randomised controlled trials showed that vitamin D supplementation protected against acute respiratory tract infections and that patients with very low (<25 nmol/L) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (a marker of vitamin D status) gained the most benefit. A growing body of circumstantial evidence now also specifically links outcomes of COVID-19 and vitamin D status. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, emerged and started its spread in the Northern hemisphere at the end of 2019 (winter), when levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are at their nadir. Also, nations in the northern hemisphere have borne much of the burden of cases and mortality. In a cross-sectional analysis across Europe, COVID-19 mortality was significantly associated with vitamin D status in different populations. The low mortality rates in Nordic countries are exceptions to the trend towards poorer outcomes in more northerly latitudes, but populations in these countries are relatively vitamin D sufficient owing to widespread fortification of foods. Italy and Spain are also exceptions, but prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in these populations is surprisingly common. Additionally, black and minority ethnic people—who are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency because they have darker skin—seem to be worse affected than white people by COVID-19. For example, data from the UK Office for National Statistics shows that black people in England and Wales are more than four times more likely to die from COVID-19 than are white people. A role for vitamin D in the response to COVID-19 infection could be twofold. First, vitamin D supports production of antimicrobial peptides in the respiratory epithelium, thus making infection with the virus and development of COVID-19 symptoms less likely. Second, vitamin D might help to reduce the inflammatory response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Deregulation of this response, especially of the renin–angiotensin system, is characteristic of COVID-19 and degree of overactivation is associated with poorer prognosis. Vitamin D is known to interact with a protein in this pathway—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)—which is also exploited by SARS-CoV-2 as an entry receptor. While SARS-CoV-2 downregulates expression of ACE2, vitamin D promotes expression of this gene. Rose Anne Kenny (Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin, Ireland) led the cross-sectional study into mortality and vitamin D status and is the lead investigator of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). She is adamant that the recommendations from all public health bodies should be for the population to take vitamin D supplements during this pandemic. “The circumstantial evidence is very strong”, she proclaims regarding the potential effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Adding, “we don't have randomised controlled trial evidence, but how long do you want to wait in the context of such a crisis? We know vitamin D is important for musculoskeletal function, so people should be taking it anyway”. Kenny recommends that, at the very least, vitamin D supplements are given to care home residents unless there is an extremely good reason not to do so. Adrian Martineau (Institute of Population Health Sciences, Barts and The London, Queen Mary University of London, UK), lead author of the 2017 meta-analysis has joined with colleagues from universities around the UK to launch COVIDENCE UK, a study to investigate how diet and lifestyle factors might influence transmission of SARS-CoV-2, severity of COVID-19 symptoms, speed of recovery, and any long-term effects. They aim to recruit at least 12 000 people and to obtain interim results by the summer. Despite his enthusiasm for the study, Martineau is pragmatic: “At best vitamin D deficiency will only be one of many factors involved in determining outcome of COVID-19, but it's a problem that could be corrected safely and cheaply; there is no downside to speak of, and good reason to think there might be a benefit”.

These include Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and CanSino's non-replicating adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine, which both entered phase 1 clinical trials on March 16, 2020; Inovio Pharmaceuticals' DNA vaccine for COVID-19, which entered trials on April 3, 2020; three inactive COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Sinovac, Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, and Beijing Institute of Biological Products entered clinical trials in April, 2020, successively; University of Oxford's non-replicating chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and BioNTech's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine also started trials in recent months. Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on May 8, 2020, for clinical trial reports with the terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, and “clinical trial” and no date or language restrictions; no other data from a human clinical trial of COVID-19 vaccine have been reported thus far, to our knowledge. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for unpublished trials of COVID-19 vaccines, up to May 6, 2020. In addition to the adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine reported here, seven candidate COVID-19 vaccines are in ongoing clinical trials, including Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Inovio Pharmaceuticals' DNA vaccine, Sinovac, Wuhan and Beijing Institute of Biological Products' inactive COVID-19 vaccines, University of Oxford's chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, and BioNTech's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.Added value of this studyThis first-in-human trial showed that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerable and immunogenic in healthy adults. One dose of the vaccine at all dose concentrations (5 × 1010, 1 × 1011, and 1·5 × 1011 viral particles) tested induced both specific antibody and T-cell responses in most participants. Rapid specific T-cell responses were noted at day 14 and specific humoral responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination. Although we found that the high dose vaccine tended to be more immunogenic than the middle dose and low dose vaccines, it was also associated with a higher reactogenicity. Severe fever, fatigue, dyspnoea, muscle pain, and joint pain were reported in some of the recipients in the high dose group.Implications of all the available evidenceMany vaccine candidates are in rapid development, including recombinant-protein based vaccines, replicating or non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines (which mostly have focused on the spike glycoprotein or receptor binding domain), live attenuated vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines. All of these vaccine platforms have advantages and disadvantages, and it is too soon to predict which will be more successful. Our study suggests that there is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.

Our study suggests that there is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19. Here, we report the preliminary assessment at 28 days post-vaccination of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CanSino's non-replicating Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults in China. We did a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, dose-escalation phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate in a rehabilitation centre in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Eligible participants were healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years, who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by negative results of serum specific IgM and IgG antibodies with a commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid test kit (Jinwofu, Beijing, China), negative nucleic acid for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs or sputum and anal swabs detected with a nucleic acid diagnostic kit (PCR-fluorescence probing, Sansure Biotech, Changsha, China), and a clear chest CT image with no evidence of lesions in the lungs at the time of screening. Exclusion criteria were a history of seizures or mental illness; allergy to any ingredient included in the vaccine; acute febrile disease on the day of enrolment; receipt of any blood products in the past 4 months; receipt of any research medicines or vaccine in the past month; and being unable to comply with the study schedule. Further details are outlined in the protocol.10Zhu F-C Guan X-H Wang W et al.Protocol. A single-center, open-label, dose-escalating phase I clinical trial of the recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine (adenovirus type 5 vector) in healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years in China.http://www.jscdc.cn/jkfw/kygz/202005/P020200517367817987697.pdfDate: 2020Date accessed: May 20, 2020Google Scholar Participants were sequentially enrolled to receive a single intramuscular injection in a dose-escalating manner: the first group of participants were allocated to receive the low dose, followed up for a minimum of 3 days before proceeding to recruit further participants to receive the middle dose, and then after safety observation for 3 days, the last group of participants were recruited and allocated to receive the high dose. The administration of higher dose injections and new enrolment were paused if any criteria for pausing dose escalation were met. The protocol and informed consent were approved by the institutional review board of the Jiangsu Provincial Center of Disease Control and Prevention. Written informed consent from all participants was obtained before screening. This study was undertaken by Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was developed by Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Beijing, China) and CanSino Biologics (Tianjin, China). The vaccine is a replication defective Ad5 vectored vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. We cloned an optimised full-length spike gene based on Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number YP_009724390) with the tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide gene into an E1 and E3 deleted Ad5 vector, and constructed the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine using the Admax system from Microbix Biosystem (Toronto, ON, Canada). The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was manufactured as a liquid formulation containing 5 × 1010 viral particles per 0·5 mL in a vial. A single shot was allocated intramuscularly in the arm of the participants in the low dose group, with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (5 × 1010 viral particles per 0·5 mL). The participants in the middle dose group received one shot intramuscularly in the arm with two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (1 × 1011 viral particles per mL). Participants in the high dose group received a double-shot regimen with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in one arm and two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in the other arm (1·5 × 1011 viral particles per 1·5 mL). Adverse events were self-reported by the participants, but verified by investigators daily during the first 14 days after vaccination. Subsequently, adverse events were recorded by the participants on diary cards in the following weeks. Laboratory safety tests including white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophils, platelets, haemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine were measured on day 7 to assess any toxic effects post-vaccination. We graded adverse events and abnormal changes in laboratory tests according to the scale issued by the China State Food and Drug Administration (version 2019).11National Medical Products Administrationhttp://www.nmpa.gov.cn/WS04/CL2138/373037.htmlDate: 2019Date accessed: May 20, 2020Google Scholar Blood samples were taken from participants for serology tests at the scheduled site visits before the vaccination, and on days 14 and 28 after the vaccination. We assessed binding antibody responses against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike glycoprotein with ELISA kits manufactured by Beijing Wantai BioPharm (Beijing, China). A dilution of 1:40 was the positivity cutoff value for ELISA. We also measured the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination using both live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation (virus strain SARS-CoV-2/human/CHN/Wuhan_IME-BJ01/2020, GenBank number MT291831.1) and pseudovirus neutralisation tests (a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirus system expressing the spike glycoprotein).12Nie J Li Q Wu J et al.Establishment and validation of a pseudovirus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2.Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020; 9: 680-686Google Scholar Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood before the vaccination and at days 14 and 28 post-vaccination. Specific T-cell responses were quantified with an interferon (IFN) γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptide pools for about 12–24 h before detection, and expressed as the number of spot-forming cells per 100 000 cells. All measurements were subtracted from the unstimulated control values, and minus values were corrected to zero. The results were considered positive if there was at least a two-times increase in the number of IFNγ secreting T cells post-vaccination. We also assessed the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to vaccination according to the secretion of IFNγ, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), which were measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after the stimulation with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptide pools for about 6 h and detected by flow cytometry. Similar methods to measure T-cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining assays have been reported previously.13Ewer K Rampling T Venkatraman N et al.A monovalent chimpanzee adenovirus Ebola vaccine boosted with MVA.N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 1635-1646Google Scholar,  14De Santis O Audran R Pothin E et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine in healthy adults: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 1/2a study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2016; 16: 311-320Google Scholar The pre-vaccination and post-vaccination anti-Ad5 neutralising antibody titres were detected with a serum neutralisation assay.15Sprangers MC Lakhai W Koudstaal W et al.Quantifying adenovirus-neutralizing antibodies by luciferase transgene detection: addressing preexisting immunity to vaccine and gene therapy vectors.J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41: 5046-5052Google Scholar We analysed all outcomes in the intention-to-treat cohort. The primary endpoint for safety was the occurrence of adverse reactions within 7 days after the vaccination. Any abnormal changes in laboratory measures at 7 days post-vaccination, and adverse events within 28 days across the treatment groups were also analysed as secondary safety endpoints. The specific ELISA antibody titres to RBD and the spike glycoprotein, and the neutralising antibody amounts against live SARS-CoV-2 and a pseudovirus were measured as humoral immunogenicity endpoints. We defined a positive antibody response (seroconversion) as at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titre from baseline. ELISpot IFNγ and positive T-cell responses measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays were compared across the groups as endpoints for cell-mediated responses. Stratified analyses of the immune responses were done based on the pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres among the participants as low or negative (≤1:200) or high (>1:200). The sample size was not determined on the basis of statistical power calculations; however, a minimum sample size of 20–30 participants for a pilot vaccine trial has been recommended by the National Medical Products Administration, China. We assessed the number and proportion of participants with adverse reactions post-vaccination and compared safety profiles across the dose groups. The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were presented as geometric mean titres with 95% CIs and the cellular responses were shown as a proportion of positive responders. We used the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test to analyse categorical data, ANOVA to analyse the log transformed antibody titres, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for data that were not normally distributed. When the overall difference across the three groups was significant, pairwise comparisons were made and the differences between groups were estimated with 95% CIs. Multivariable analysis was used to establish the possible effects on the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine candidates. Hypothesis testing was two-sided with an α value of 0·05. Statistical analyses were done by a statistician using SAS (version 9.4) or GraphPad Prism 8·0·1. SPICE (version 6.0) was used for the analysis of data from multicolour flow cytometry experiments. An independent data and safety monitoring committee, with one independent statistician, one clinician, and one epidemiologist, was established before the start of the trial. Safety data for the first 3 days post-vaccination were assessed and reviewed by the committee to ensure that there was sufficient holding time between dose escalation.

Between March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 were sequentially enrolled and assigned to receive the low dose (n=36 [33%]), middle dose (n=36 [33%]), or high dose (n=36 [33%]) of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (appendix p 2). All participants completed the vaccination and the scheduled visits within 28 days.

No significant difference in the overall number of adverse reactions across the treatment groups was observed. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients. Pain was reported in 17 (47%) participants in the low dose group, 20 (56%) participants in the middle dose group, and 21 (58%) participants in the high dose group. The most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions overall were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]). Fever was reported in 15 (42%) participants in the low dose group, 15 (42%) participants in the middle dose group, and 20 (56%) participants in the high dose group. Headache was reported in 14 (39%) participants in the low dose group, 11 (31%) participants in the middle dose group, and 17 (47%) participants in the high dose group. Muscle pain was reported in seven (19%) participants in the low dose group, three (8%) participants in the middle dose group, and eight (22%) participants in the high dose group. Most adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Nine participants (two [6%] in the low dose group, two [6%] in the middle dose group, and five [14%] in the high dose group) had an episode of severe fever (grade 3) with axillary temperature greater than 38·5°C. Of them, one (3%) from the high dose group reported severe fever along with severe symptoms of fatigue, dyspnoea, and muscle pain. One participant in the high dose group reported severe fatigue and joint pain (appendix p 3). These reactions occurred within 24 h post-vaccination, and persisted for no more than 48 h. We found no significant difference in the incidences of adverse reactions or overall adverse events among the dose groups. High pre-existing Ad5 immunity (titre of >1:200 vs ≤1:200) was associated with significantly fewer occurrences of fever post-vaccination (odds ratio 0·3, 95% CI 0·1–0·6; appendix p 4). No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days. At day 7 after vaccination, nine (8%) participants had mild to moderate total bilirubin increase, ten (9%) had alanine aminotransferase increase, and four (4%) had fasting hyperglycaemia (appendix p 5), but no instances were considered as clinically significant.Table 2Adverse reactions within 7 days and overall adverse events within 28 days after vaccinationLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)Total (N=108)All adverse reactions within 0–7 daysAny30 (83%)30 (83%)27 (75%)87 (81%)Grade 32 (6%)2 (6%)6 (17%)10 (9%)Injection site adverse reactions within 0–7 daysPain17 (47%)20 (56%)21 (58%)58 (54%)Induration2 (6%)1 (3%)1 (3%)4 (4%)Redness2 (6%)1 (3%)1 (3%)4 (4%)Swelling4 (11%)4 (11%)08 (7%)Itch2 (6%)3 (8%)05 (5%)Muscular weakness001 (3%)1 (1%)Systemic adverse reactions within 0–7 daysFever15 (42%)15 (42%)20 (56%)50 (46%)Grade 3 fever2 (6%)2 (6%)5 (14%)9 (8%)Headache14 (39%)11 (31%)17 (47%)42 (39%)Fatigue17 (47%)14 (39%)16 (44%)47 (44%)Grade 3 fatigue002 (6%)2 (2%)Vomiting1 (3%)01 (3%)2 (2%)Diarrhoea3 (8%)4 (11%)5 (14%)12 (11%)Muscle pain7 (19%)3 (8%)8 (22%)18 (17%)Grade 3 muscle pain001 (3%)1 (1%)Joint pain2 (6%)2 (6%)5 (14%)9 (8%)Grade 3 joint pain001 (3%)1 (1%)Throat pain1 (3%)3 (8%)4 (11%)8 (7%)Cough1 (3%)2 (6%)3 (8%)6 (6%)Nausea2 (6%)1 (3%)3 (8%)6 (6%)Functional GI disorder1 (3%)001 (1%)Dyspnoea002 (6%)2 (2%)Grade 3 dyspnoea001 (3%)1 (1%)Appetite impaired6 (17%)5 (14%)6 (17%)17 (16%)Dizziness1 (3%)01 (3%)2 (2%)Mucosal abnormality001 (3%)1 (1%)Pruritus1 (3%)1 (3%)1 (3%)3 (3%)Overall adverse events within 0–28 daysAny31 (86%)30 (83%)27 (75%)88 (81%)Grade 32 (6%)2 (6%)6 (17%)10 (9%)Data are n (%).

Grade 3=severe (ie, prevented activity). GI=gastrointestinal. Rapid binding antibody responses to RBD were observed in all three dose groups from day 14 (table 3). At day 28, the recipients in the high dose group tended to have a higher binding antibody geometric mean titre of 1445·8 (95% CI 935·5–2234·5), followed by 806·0 (528·2–1229·9) in the middle dose group, and 615·8 (405·4–935·5) in the low dose group (high dose vs low dose 1611·5, 531·5–2691·5). At least a four-fold increase of anti-RBD antibodies was noted in 35 (97%) of 36 participants in the low dose group, 34 (94%) of 36 in the middle dose group, and 36 (100%) of 36 in the high dose group. Neutralising antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 were all negative at day 0, and increased moderately at day 14, peaking at 28 days post-vaccination. Neutralising antibody titre with a geometric mean titre of 34·0 (95% CI 22·6–50·1) was noted in the high dose group, which was significantly higher compared with 16·2 (10·4–25·2) in the middle dose group and 14·5 (9·6–21·8) in the low dose group, with an estimated difference of 27·7 (1·0–54·4) between the high dose group and the middle dose group and 33·2 (6·5–59·9) between the high dose group and the low dose group at day 28. Meanwhile, 18 (50%) participants in the low dose group, 18 (50%) in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) in the high dose group had at least a four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titres by day 28. Similar patterns of the binding antibody to spike glycoprotein and neutralising antibody titre to pseudovirus post-vaccination across the dose groups were also noted (appendix p 6). The association between the ELISA antibodies to RBD and neutralising antibody titres against live virus showed a moderate positive correlation of 0·749, and that between the ELISA antibodies to spike glycoprotein and neutralising antibody titres against live virus was 0·753, at the peak antibody response (p<0·0001). The neutralising antibody titres measured using a pseudovirus were also correlated well with those measured by live SARS-CoV-2 (appendix p 7).Table 3Specific antibody responses to the receptor binding domain, and neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2Day 14Day 28Low dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)p valueLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)p valueELISA antibodies to the receptor binding domainGMT76·5 (44·3–132·0)91·2 (55·9–148·7)132·6 (80·7–218·0)0·29615·8 (405·4–935·5)806·0 (528·2–1229·9)1445·8 (935·5–2234·5)0·016≥4-fold increase16 (44%)18 (50%)22 (61%)0·3535 (97%)34 (94%)36 (100%)0·77Neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2GMT8·2 (5·8–11·5)9·6 (6·6–14·1)12·7 (8·5–19·0)0·2414·5 (9·6–21·8)16·2 (10·4–25·2)34·0 (22·6–50·1)0·0082≥4-fold increase10 (28%)11 (31%)15 (42%)0·4218 (50%)18 (50%)27 (75%)0·046Data are mean (95% CI) or n (%).

Before vaccination, 20 (56%) participants in the low dose group, 19 (53%) participants in the middle dose group, and 16 (44%) participants in the high dose group had a high pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titre (>1:200). Only five (25%) participants of 20 in the low dose group, seven (37%) participants of 19 in the middle dose group, and ten (63%) participants of 16 in the high dose group, who had high pre-existing Ad5 immunity, had at least a four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titre at day 28 post-vaccination (appendix pp 8–10). Multivariable analysis showed that high pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres compromised the seroconversion of neutralising antibody post-vaccination, regardless of the vaccine doses, and recipients aged 45–60 years seemed to have lower seroconversion of neutralising antibody compared with the younger recipients (appendix p 11). The Ad5 neutralising antibodies were significantly boosted post-vaccination (appendix p 12). ELISpot responses at baseline were undetectable with spot-forming cells below the level of detection of the assay in all participants, but peaked at day 14 post-vaccination. The proportions of positive responders ranged from 83–97% across the dose groups, with a mean number of spot-forming cells per 100 000 cells of 20·8 (95% CI 12·7–34·0) in the low dose group, 40·8 (27·6–60·3) in the middle dose group, and 58·0 (39·1–85·9) in the high dose group (figure 1). T-cell responses in the high dose group were significantly higher than that in the low dose group (p<0·0010), but not significant compared with that in the middle dose group. A slight decrease of the T-cell responses across the dose groups was noted at day 28. High levels of baseline Ad5 neutralising antibody titre reduced the peak of post-vaccination T-cell responses in all the dose groups, particularly for the low dose group. Despite the effect of high pre-existing Ad5 immunity, positive responders were identified in 15 (75%) of 20 participants in the low dose group, 18 (95%) of 19 participants in the middle dose group, and 15 (94%) of 16 participants in the high dose group at day 14, and 12 (60%) of 20 participants in the low dose group, 16 (84%) of 19 participants in the middle dose group, and 16 (100%) of 16 participants in the high dose group at day 28.Figure 1Specific T-cell response measured by ELISpotShow full caption(A) The number of specific T cells with secretion of IFNγ at days 0, 14, and 28 in all participants, and stratified by pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres.

IFNγ was detected from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after the vaccination at day 14 and 28, in all dose groups (figure 2, appendix p 13). The TNFα expression from CD4+ T cells tended to be significantly lower in the low dose group than that in the high dose (p<0·0001) and middle dose groups (p=0·0032), on day 14. The TNFα expression from CD8+ T cells showed an overall p value of less than 0·0001 across the three groups on day 14. And the TNFα expression from CD8+ T cells tended to be higher in the high dose group than that in both the middle dose group (p=0·016) and the low dose group (p<0·0001). The p values are for the pairwise comparisons between groups. Amounts of IL-2 detected from CD4+ T cells were higher than that detected from CD8+ cells. The proportions of polyfunctional phenotypes detected from memory CD4+ T cells were higher than those from CD8+ T cells. Higher proportions of polyfunctional phenotypes were noted with the higher vaccine doses. We also noted that pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody had a negative effect on the pattern of T-cell responses (appendix pp 14–16). A post-hoc analysis showed that 28 (78%) participants in the low dose group, 33 (92%) participants in the middle dose group, and 36 (100%) participants in the high dose group showed either positive T-cell responses to spike glycoprotein or seroconversion of neutralising antibody to live SARS-CoV-2, at day 28 post-vaccination (appendix p 17).Figure 2Flow cytometry with intracellular cytokine staining before and after vaccinationShow full caption(A) Percentage of cells secreting IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 from CD4+ T cells.

To exclude any possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the study period, we tested the serum antibodies to nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in participants at day 28 using a special IgG/IgM rapid test kit (Vazyme Biotech, number CD101, Nanjing, China), but none of the participants were positive. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a first-in-human clinical trial of a novel Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerated in healthy adults in all three dose groups. The most common adverse reactions were fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain with no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions across the groups. Most adverse events reported were mild or moderate in severity. We noticed a higher reactogenicity profile of the high dose at 1·5 × 1011 viral particles, presenting as severe fever, fatigue, muscle pain, or joint pain, which might be associated with viraemia caused by Ad5 vector infection. However, the severe adverse reactions were transient and self-limiting. Additionally, no abnormal changes in laboratory measurements were clinically significant or considered to be related to the vaccine. The profile of adverse events reported in this trial is similar to that of another Ad5 vector-based Ebola vaccine expressing glycoprotein.16Zhu FC Hou LH Li JX et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a novel recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine in healthy adults in China: preliminary report of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial.Lancet. 2015; 385: 2272-2279Google Scholar To accelerate the process of clinical evaluation of the candidate COVID-19 vaccine, we selected doses for the phase 2 study mainly on the basis of the safety profile of the candidate vaccines shown in the participants within 7 days and 14 days post-vaccination. We chose the low dose (5 × 1010 viral particles) and middle dose (1 × 1011 viral particles) to be further assessed in a phase 2 clinical trial. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was immunogenic, inducing humoral and T-cell responses rapidly in most participants. Onset of detectable immune responses was rapid, with T-cell responses peaking at day 14 after vaccination and antibodies peaking at day 28. The antibody response to the vaccine in the high dose group was slightly greater than that in the middle dose and low dose groups. A single dose of Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was able to elicit a four-fold increase in binding antibodies to RBD in 94–100% of participants, and a four-fold increase to live virus in 50–75% of participants. Despite differences in magnitudes of the antibodies measured through different methods, there was a strong positive correlation between binding antibodies and neutralising antibody titres to the live virus. High proportions of participants with positive T-cell responses were noted across the all dose groups post-vaccination. The activation of both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was observed in vaccine recipients, particularly for antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. However, both the specific antibody response and T-cell response induced by vaccination were partly diminished by the presence of high pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity. Currently, correlates of protection for a vaccine against COVID-19 are unknown, and the roles of the specific antibodies or T cells in building effective protection are not yet defined. Therefore, we are unable to predict the protection of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine on the basis of the vaccine-elicited immune responses in this study. However, previous studies investigating SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) found that the increases in specific antibodies were temporary, and declined quickly in patients after recovery, whereas the specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses played an essential role in immunity.17Zhao J Zhao J Perlman S T cell responses are required for protection from clinical disease and for virus clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected mice.J Virol. 2010; 84: 9318-9325Google Scholar,  18Channappanavar R Fett C Zhao J Meyerholz DK Perlman S Virus-specific memory CD8 T cells provide substantial protection from lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.J Virol. 2014; 88: 11034-11044Google Scholar A similar rapid decline of the specific antibody amounts in patients with COVID-19 after recovery was also noted,19Wang X Guo X Xin Q et al.Neutralizing antibodies responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients.medRxiv. 2020;  (DOI: 2020.04.15.20065623 (preprint))Google Scholar,  20Wu F Wang A Liu M et al.Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications.medRxiv. 2020;  (DOI: 2020.03.30.20047365 (preprint))Google Scholar suggesting that both specific cellular and humoral immunity are potentially important for a successful COVID-19 vaccine. Here, we only report the data within 28 days after the vaccination, but we are going to follow up the vaccine recipients for at least 6 months, so more data will be obtained. This study was done in Wuhan, Hubei province, which was the centre of the COVID-19 epidemic in China.21Chen N Zhou M Dong X et al.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 507-513Google Scholar People living in the city of Wuhan had a much higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those living in other cities outside of Hubei province, even though when we initiated this trial, the city had already begun lockdown and implemented mandatory home isolation for residents. Therefore, we did serological screening, nucleic acid testing, and chest CT to exclude participants who had been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during recruitment. In addition, we arranged for all participants in our study to stay in a designated hotel for 14 days post-vaccination. This arrangement facilitated the observation of adverse events after the immunisation of the participants, and reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the following 2 weeks. These measures allowed the study to be done successfully without interference by the circulation of SARS-CoV-2, which is especially important in the absence of a placebo control. Interpretation of the results of this study is limited by the small size of the cohort, the short duration of follow-up, and the absence of a randomised control group. As it was a first-in-human study of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine, it was not designed to measure the vaccine efficacy. However, in preclinical studies, seven out of eight ferrets were protected from having detectable virus copies when challenged by SARS-CoV-2 through nasal dripping 21 days after immunisation with the vaccine, whereas only one out of eight ferrets in the control group was negative for virus copies (Wei C, unpublished). We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the candidate vaccine in healthy adults, with no interference by underlying diseases or medicines. However, results of our study indicated that older age could have a negative effect on the vaccine-elicited responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this trial, no participants were older than 60 years and only 16% of the participants were older than 50 years, providing limited information on the capability of generating a potent cellular and humoral response in the older population. Since age has also been identified as an independent risk factor for severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,4Weiss P Murdoch DR Clinical course and mortality risk of severe COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1014-1015Google Scholar,  22Ye G Pan Z Pan Y et al.Clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reactivation.J Infect. 2020; 80: e14-e17Google Scholar and there is a possibility that an even lower immune response might be found in the older population, we are going to include participants who are older than 60 years in the phase 2 study considering this population as an important target population for a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, experience with vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS have raised concerns about the antibody-dependent enhancement in participants who are infected with a circulating SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination.23Lurie N Saville M Hatchett R Halton J Developing Covid-19 vaccines at pandemic speed.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (NEJMp2005630.)Google Scholar However, this study was not statistically powered to measure any safety outcome, especially for the concerns around immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement events associated with the full-length spike glycoprotein vaccine antigen.24Cao X COVID-19: immunopathology and its implications for therapy.Nat Rev Immunol. 2020; 20: 269-270Google Scholar Our study found that the pre-existing Ad5 immunity could slow down the rapid immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and also lower the peak of the responses, particularly for humoral immunity. The high pre-existing Ad5 immunity might also have a negative effect on the persistence of the vaccine-elicited immune responses. In previous studies, heterologous prime-boost combinations or homologous prime-boost regimens with Ad5 vectored vaccines were shown to be able to induce more strong and durable immunogenic responses in populations with high pre-existing Ad5 immunity.25Venkatraman N Ndiaye BP Bowyer G et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous prime-boost Ebola virus vaccine regimen in healthy adults in the United Kingdom and Senegal.J Infect Dis. 2019; 219: 1187-1197Google Scholar,  26Dolzhikova IV Zubkova OV Tukhvatulin AI et al.Safety and immunogenicity of GamEvac-Combi, a heterologous VSV- and Ad5-vectored Ebola vaccine: an open phase I/II trial in healthy adults in Russia.Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017; 13: 613-620Google Scholar,  27Shukarev G Callendret B Luhn K Douoguih M A two-dose heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimen eliciting sustained immune responses to Ebola Zaire could support a preventive strategy for future outbreaks.Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017; 13: 266-270Google Scholar Nevertheless, limited information is available for the effects of multiple doses of the candidate Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in humans, which warrants further investigation. Over the past decade, the vaccine industry and clinical research centres have been asked to provide urgent responses to epidemics of emerging infectious diseases, such as H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus, Zika, MERS, and now SARS-CoV-2.23Lurie N Saville M Hatchett R Halton J Developing Covid-19 vaccines at pandemic speed.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (NEJMp2005630.)Google Scholar The risk of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, making the need for effective vaccines even more urgent.28Richardson S Hirsch JS Narasimhan M et al.Presenting characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area.JAMA. 2020;  (published online April 22.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.6775Google Scholar We started the development of this candidate vaccine in January, 2020, when SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated and sequenced. The full-length spike glycoprotein was selected as the vaccine antigen, mainly on the basis of previous experience with SARS and MERS vaccines. Previous findings suggested that those vaccines expressing full-length spike glycoprotein can induce good immune responses and protective efficacy.29Yong CY Ong HK Yeap SK Ho KL Tan WS Recent advances in the vaccine development against Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus.Front Microbiol. 2019; 101781Google Scholar Although the RBD comprises the critical neutralising domains for the coronaviruses, the neutralising epitopes located outside the RBD were also identified.30Duan J Yan X Guo X et al.A human SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody against epitope on S2 protein.Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005; 333: 186-193Google Scholar,  31Wang Q Zhang L Kuwahara K et al.Immunodominant SARS coronavirus epitopes in humans elicited both enhancing and neutralizing effects on infection in non-human primates.ACS Infect Dis. 2016; 2: 361-376Google Scholar The full-length spike was chosen in most of the viral vectored, mRNA, or DNA COVID-19 vaccines in development.9WHODRAFT landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines–30 April 2020.https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccinesDate: 2020Date accessed: May 5, 2020Google Scholar The Ad5 vector vaccine platform is highly efficient and well established as a vaccine antigen delivery system. In addition to our candidate Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine, there are several other Ad5-based vaccines against COVID-19 listed in the WHO draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines, including Ad5 S (GREVAXTM platform) in the USA, and Oral Ad5 S (Stabilitech Biopharma) in the UK.9WHODRAFT landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines–30 April 2020.https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccinesDate: 2020Date accessed: May 5, 2020Google Scholar However, aside from pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity, there is a concern about the increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition associated with Ad5 activated CD4+ T cells.32Gray GE Moodie Z Metch B et al.Recombinant adenovirus type 5 HIV gag/pol/nef vaccine in South Africa: unblinded, long-term follow-up of the phase 2b HVTN 503/Phambili study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 388-396Google Scholar Although the association between HIV-1 acquisition risk and Ad5 vectored vaccine is controversial and its mechanism is unclear, the potential risks should be taken into account in studies with this viral vector delivery platform. We plan to monitor the participants in our upcoming phase 2 and phase 3 studies to assess the indication for any such acquisition. In conclusion, we found that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic in healthy adults. Specific humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination, and rapid, specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 after one shot of the vaccine. There is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for the control of the COVID-19 outbreak. An ongoing phase 2 trial in China (NCT04341389) will provide more information on the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine. Contributors F-CZ and Y-HL were co-first authors.

Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19.MethodsWe did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).Findings96 032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368–1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218–1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273–1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935–2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106–5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760–4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344–4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.InterpretationWe were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19.

Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935–2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106–5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760–4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344–4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation. We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.

The absence of an effective treatment against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led clinicians to redirect drugs that are known to be effective for other medical conditions to the treatment of COVID-19. Key among these repurposed therapeutic agents are the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine, which is used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.1Principi N Esposito S Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of COVID-19.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online April 17.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30296-6Google Scholar,  2Perricone C Triggianese P Bartoloni E et al.The anti-viral facet of anti-rheumatic drugs: lessons from COVID-19.J Autoimmun. 2020;  (published online April 17.)DOI:10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102468Google Scholar These drugs have been shown in laboratory conditions to have antiviral properties as well as immunomodulatory effects.3Liu J Cao R Xu M et al.Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 16Google Scholar,  4Devaux CA Rolain JM Colson P Raoult D New insights on the antiviral effects of chloroquine against coronavirus: what to expect for COVID-19?.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 12.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938Google Scholar However, the use of this class of drugs for COVID-19 is based on a small number of anecdotal experiences that have shown variable responses in uncontrolled observational analyses, and small, open-label, randomised trials that have largely been inconclusive.5Tang W Cao Z Han M et al.Hydroxychloroquine in patients mainly with mild to moderate COVID-19: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online May 7.)

Using an international, observational registry across six continents, we assessed 96 032 patients with COVID-19, of whom 14 888 were treated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or their combination with a macrolide. After controlling for age, sex, race or ethnicity, underlying comorbidities, and disease severity at baseline, the use of all four regimens was associated with an increased hazard for de-novo ventricular arrythmia and death in hospital. This study provides real-world evidence on the use of these therapeutic regimens by including a large number of patients from across the world. Thus, to our knowledge, these findings provide the most comprehensive evidence of the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) for treatment of COVID-19.Implications of all the available evidenceWe found no evidence of benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used either alone or with a macrolide. Previous evidence was derived from either small anecdotal studies or inconclusive small randomised trials. Our study included a large number of patients across multiple geographic regions and provides the most robust real-world evidence to date on the usefulness of these treatment regimens. Although observational studies cannot fully account for unmeasured confounding factors, our findings suggest not only an absence of therapeutic benefit but also potential harm with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine drug regimens (with or without a macrolide) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

Although several multicentre randomised controlled trials are underway, there is a pressing need to provide accurate clinical guidance because the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine along with macrolides is widespread, often with little regard for potential risk. Some countries have stockpiled these drugs, resulting in a shortage of these medications for those that need them for approved clinical indications.10Peschken CA Possible consequences of a shortage of hydroxychloroquine for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus amid the COVID-19 pandemic.J Rheumatol. 2020;  (published online April 8.)DOI:10.3899/jrheum.200395Google Scholar The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19 using a large multinational registry to assess their real-world application. Principally, we sought to analyse the association between these treatment regimens and in-hospital death. Secondarily, we aimed to evaluate the occurrence of de-novo clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias. We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised 671 hospitals located in six continents (appendix p 3). The Surgical Outcomes Collaborative (Surgisphere Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA) consists of de-identified data obtained by automated data extraction from inpatient and outpatient electronic health records, supply chain databases, and financial records. The registry uses a cloud-based health-care data analytics platform that includes specific modules for data acquisition, data warehousing, data analytics, and data reporting. A manual data entry process is used for quality assurance and validation to ensure that key missing values are kept to a minimum. The Surgical Outcomes Collaborative (hereafter referred to as the Collaborative) ensures compliance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on real-world evidence. Real-world data are collected through automated data transfers that capture 100% of the data from each health-care entity at regular, predetermined intervals, thus reducing the impact of selection bias and missing values, and ensuring that the data are current, reliable, and relevant. Verifiable source documentation for the elements include electronic inpatient and outpatient medical records and, in accordance with the FDA guidance on relevance of real-world data, data acquisition is performed through use of a standardised Health Level Seven-compliant data dictionary, with data collected on a prospective ongoing basis. The validation procedure for the registry refers to the standard operating procedures in place for each of the four ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 27001:2013 certified features of the registry: data acquisition, data warehousing, data analytics, and data reporting. The standardised Health Level Seven-compliant data dictionary used by the Collaborative serves as the focal point for all data acquisition and warehousing. Once this data dictionary is harmonised with electronic health record data, data acquisition is completed using automated interfaces to expedite data transfer and improve data integrity. Collection of a 100% sample from each health-care entity is validated against financial records and external databases to minimise selection bias. To reduce the risk of inadvertent protected health information disclosures, all such information is stripped before storage in the cloud-based data warehouse. The Collaborative is intended to minimise the effects of information bias and selection bias by capturing all-comer data and consecutive patient enrolment by capturing 100% of the data within electronic systems, ensuring that the results remain generalisable to the larger population. The Collaborative is compliant with the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines for registries. With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, this registry was used to collect data from hospitals in the USA (that are selected to match the epidemiological characteristics of the US population) and internationally, to achieve representation from diverse populations across six continents. Data have been collected from a variety of urban and rural hospitals, academic or community hospitals, and for-profit and non-profit hospitals. The data collection and analyses are deemed exempt from ethics review. We included all patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, at hospitals participating in the registry and with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection, for whom a clinical outcome of either hospital discharge or death during hospitalisation was recorded. A positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assay of nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens, and this finding was used for classifying a patient as positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 was diagnosed, at each site, on the basis of WHO guidance.11WHOClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when novel COVID-19 disease is suspected: interim guidance.https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdfDate: March 13, 2020Date accessed: April 24, 2020Google Scholar Patients who did not have a record of testing in the database, or who had a negative test, were not included in the study. Only one positive test was necessary for the patient to be included in the analysis. Patients who received either hydroxychloroquine or a chloroquine analogue-based treatment (with or without a second-generation macrolide) were included in the treatment group. Patients who received treatment with these regimens starting more than 48 h after COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. We also excluded data from patients for whom treatment was initiated while they were on mechanical ventilation or if they were receiving therapy with the antiviral remdesivir. These specific exclusion criteria were established to avoid enrolment of patients in whom the treatment might have started at non-uniform times during the course of their COVID-19 illness and to exclude individuals for whom the drug regimen might have been used during a critical phase of illness, which could skew the interpretation of the results. Thus, we defined four distinct treatment groups, in which all patients started therapy within 48 h of an established COVID-19 diagnosis: chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide. All other included patients served as the control population. Patient demographics, including age, body-mass index (BMI), sex, race or ethnicity, and continent of origin were obtained. Underlying comorbidities (based on International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification codes) present in either the inpatient or outpatient electronic health record were collected, which included cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and history of a cardiac arrhythmia), current or previous history of smoking, history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and presence of an immunosuppressed condition (steroid use, pre-existing immunological condition, or current chemotherapy in individuals with cancer). We collected data on use of medications at baseline, including cardiac medications (angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins) or use of antiviral therapy other than the drug regimens being evaluated. The initiation of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine during hospital admission was recorded, including the time of initiation. The use of second-generation macrolides, specifically azithromycin and clarithromycin, was similarly recorded. A quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) was calculated for the start of therapy (including a scored calculation of the mental status, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) on room air was recorded, as measures of disease severity. The primary outcome of interest was the association between use of a treatment regimen containing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (with or without a second-generation macrolide) when initiated early after COVID-19 diagnosis with the endpoint of in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome of interest was the association between these treatment regimens and the occurrence of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (defined as the first occurrence of a non-sustained [at least 6 sec] or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) during hospitalisation. We also analysed the rates of progression to mechanical ventilation use and the total and intensive care unit lengths of stay (in days) for patients in each group. For the primary analysis of in-hospital mortality, we controlled for confounding factors, including demographic variables, comorbidities, disease severity at presentation, and other medication use (cardiac medications and other antiviral therapies). Categorical variables are shown as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as means with SDs. Comparison of continuous data between groups was done using the unpaired t-test and categorical data were compared using Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0·05 was considered significant. Multiple imputation for missing values was not possible because for disease and drug variables, there were no codes to indicate that data were missing; if the patient's electronic health record did not include information on a clinical characteristic, it was assumed that the characteristic was not present. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to evaluate the effect of age, sex, race or ethnicity (using white race as a reference group), comorbidities (BMI, presence of coronary artery disease, presence of congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, or COPD, current smoker, history of hypertension, immunocompromised state, and history of hyperlipidaemia), medications (cardiac medications, antivirals, and the treatment regimens of interest), and severity of illness scores (qSOFA <1 and SPO2 <94%) on the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia (using the time from admission to first occurrence, or if the event did not occur, to the time of discharge) and mortality (using the time from admission to inpatient mortality or discharge). Age and BMI were treated as continuous variables and all other data were treated as categorical variables in the model. From the model, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated for included variables to determine their effect on the risk of in-hospital mortality (primary endpoint) or subsequent mechanical ventilation or death (composite endpoint). Independence of survival times (or time to first arrhythmia for the ventricular arrhythmia analysis) was confirmed. Proportionality between the predictors and the hazard was validated through an evaluation of Schoenfeld residuals, which found p>0·05 and thus confirmed proportionality. To minimise the effect of confounding factors, a propensity score matching analysis was done individually for each of the four treatment groups compared with a control group that received no form of that therapy. For each treatment group, a separate matched control was identified using exact and propensity-score matched criteria with a calliper of 0·001. This method was used to provide a close approximation of demographics, comorbidities, disease severity, and baseline medications between patients. The propensity score was based on the following variables: age, BMI, gender, race or ethnicity, comorbidities, use of ACE inhibitors, use of statins, use of angiotensin receptor blockers, treatment with other antivirals, qSOFA score of less than 1, and SPO2 of less than 94% on room air. The patients were well matched, with standardised mean difference estimates of less than 10% for all matched parameters. Additional analyses were done to examine the robustness of the estimates initially obtained. Individual analyses by continent of origin and sex-adjusted analyses using Cox proportional hazards models were performed. A tipping-point analysis (an analysis that shows the effect size and prevalence of an unmeasured confounder that could shift the upper boundary of the CI towards null) was also done. All statistical analyses were done with R version 3.6.3 and SPSS version 26.

The corresponding author and co-author ANP had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 96 032 hospitalised patients from 671 hospitals were diagnosed with COVID-19 between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020 and met the inclusion criteria for this study (figure 1). All included patients completed their hospital course (discharged or died) by April 21, 2020. Patients who were hospitalised during the study period without a completed course were unable to be analysed. The study cohort included 63 315 (65·9%) patients from North America, 16 574 (17·3%) from Europe, 7555 (7·9%) from Asia, 4402 (4·6%) from Africa, 3577 (3·7%) from South America, and 609 (0·6%) from Australia (details of the number of hospitals per continent are presented in the appendix, p 3). The mean age was 53·8 years (SD 17·6), 44 426 (46·3%) were women, mean BMI was 27·6 kg/m2 (SD 5·5; 29 510 [30·7%] were obese with BMI ≥30 kg/m2), 64 220 (66·9%) were white, 9054 (9·4%) were black, 5978 (6·2%) were Hispanic, and 13 519 (14·1%) were of Asian origin (appendix p 4). In terms of comorbidities, 30 198 (31·4%) had hyperlipidaemia, 25 810 (26·9%) had hypertension, 13 260 (13·8%) had diabetes, 3177 (3·3%) had COPD, 2868 (3·0%) had an underlying immunosuppressed condition, 16 553 (17·2%) were former smokers, and 9488 (9·9%) were current smokers. In terms of pre-existing cardiovascular disease, 12 137 (12·6%) had coronary artery disease, 2368 (2·5%) had a history of congestive heart failure, and 3381 (3·5%) had a history of arrhythmia. The mean length of stay in hospital was 9·1 days (SD 6·4), with an overall in-hospital mortality of 10 698 (11·1%) of 96 032. The use of other antivirals was recorded in 38 927 (40·5%) patients as treatment for COVID-19. The most common antivirals were lopinavir with ritonavir (12 304 [31·6%]), ribavirin (7904 [20·3%]), and oseltamivir (5101 [13·1%]). Combination therapy with more than one of these antiviral regimens was used for 6782 (17·4%) patients.Figure 1Study profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) The treatment groups included 1868 patients who were given chloroquine alone, 3016 given hydroxychloroquine alone, 3783 given chloroquine with a macrolide and 6221 given hydroxychloroquine and a macrolide. The median time from hospitalisation to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2 days (IQR 1–4). The mean daily dose and duration of the various drug regimens were as follows: chloroquine alone, 765 mg (SD 308) and 6·6 days (2·4); hydroxychloroquine alone, 596 mg (126) and 4·2 days (1·9); chloroquine with a macrolide, 790 mg (320) and 6·8 days (2·5); and hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, 597 mg (128) and 4·3 days (2·0). Additional details of the study cohort are provided in the appendix (pp 4–5). Demographic variables and comorbidities were compared among survivors and non-survivors (table 1). Non-survivors were older, more likely to be obese, more likely to be men, more likely to be black or Hispanic, and to have diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and a history of arrhythmias. Non-survivors were also more likely to have COPD and to have reported current smoking.Table 1Demographics and comorbidities of patients by survival or non-survival during hospitalisationSurvivors (n=85 334)Non-survivors (n=10 698)p valueAge, years53·1 (17·5)60·0 (17·6)<0·0001BMI, kg/m227·0 (5·1)31·8 (6·4)<0·0001Obese, BMI >30 kg/m222 992 (26·9%)6518 (60·9%)<0·0001SexFemale40 169 (47·1%)4257 (39·8%)<0·0001Male45 165 (52·9%)6441 (60·2%)<0·0001Race or ethnicityWhite57 503 (67·4%)6717 (62·8%)<0·0001Black7219 (8·5%)1835 (17·2%)<0·0001Hispanic4948 (5·8%)1030 (9·6%)<0·0001Asian12 657 (14·8%)862 (8·1%)<0·0001Native American1023 (1·2%)56 (0·5%)<0·0001Other1984 (2·3%)198 (1·9%)0·0019Comorbidities at baselineCoronary artery disease9777 (11·5%)2360 (22·1%)<0·0001Congestive heart failure1828 (2·1%)540 (5·0%)<0·0001Arrhythmia2700 (3·2%)681 (6·4%)<0·0001Diabetes10 963 (12·8%)2297 (21·5%)<0·0001Hypertension21 948 (25·7%)3862 (36·1%)<0·0001Hyperlipidaemia26 480 (31·0%)3718 (34·8%)<0·0001COPD2603 (3·1%)574 (5·4%)<0·0001Current smoker7972 (9·3%)1516 (14·2%)<0·0001Former smoker14 681 (17·2%)1872 (17·5%)0·45Immunocompromised2406 (2·8%)462 (4·3%)<0·0001MedicationsACE inhibitor7521 (8·8%)428 (4·0%)<0·0001Statin8506 (10·0%)739 (6·9%)<0·0001Angiotensin receptor blocker5190 (6·1%)659 (6·2%)0·75Antiviral35 189 (41·2%)3738 (34·9%)<0·0001Disease severityqSOFA <171 457 (83·7%)7911 (73·9%)<0·0001SPO2 <94%7188 (8·4%)2129 (19·9%)<0·0001Treatment groupChloroquine alone1561 (1·8%)307 (2·9%)<0·0001Chloroquine with macrolide** Macrolides include only azithromycin or clarithromycin.2944 (3·4%)839 (7·8%)<0·0001Hydroxychloroquine alone2473 (2·9%)543 (5·1%)<0·0001Hydroxychloroquine with macrolide** Macrolides include only azithromycin or clarithromycin.4742 (5·6%)1479 (13·8%)<0·0001OutcomesDe-novo ventricular arrhythmia839 (1·0%)400 (3·7%)<0·0001Non-ICU length of stay, days9·0 (6·2)9·8 (7·4)<0·0001ICU length of stay, days2·1 (3·7)9·4 (10·6)<0·0001Total length of stay, days11·1 (7·3)19·2 (14·4)<0·0001Mechanical ventilation4821 (5·6%)4533 (42·4%)<0·0001Data are mean (SD) or n (%).

Analyses using propensity score matching by treatment group are shown in the appendix (pp 15–18). The results indicated that the associations between the drug regimens and mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias were consistent with the primary analysis. A tipping point analysis was done to assess the effects of an unmeasured confounder on the findings of significance with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (appendix pp 19–20). For chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 50% in the exposed population would need to have an HR of 1·5 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. For a comparison with the observed confounders in this study, if congestive heart failure (which has an HR of 1·756) were left out of the model, it would need to have a prevalence of approximately 30% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis. Similarly, for hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 37% in the exposed population would need to have an HR of 2·0 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. Again, congestive heart failure (which has an HR of 1·756) would need to have a prevalence of approximately 50% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis, had it not been adjusted for in the Cox proportional hazards model. In this large multinational real-world analysis, we did not observe any benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (when used alone or in combination with a macrolide) on in-hospital outcomes, when initiated early after diagnosis of COVID-19. Each of the drug regimens of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide was associated with an increased hazard for clinically significant occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of in-hospital death with COVID-19. The use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in COVID-19 is based on widespread publicity of small, uncontrolled studies, which suggested that the combination of hydroxychloroquine with the macrolide azithromycin was successful in clearing viral replication.7Gautret P Lagier JC Parola P et al.Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 20.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949Google Scholar On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for these drugs in patients if clinical trial access was unavailable.12US Food and Drug AdministrationEmergency use authorization: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) EUA information.https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covidtherapeuticsDate accessed: May 15, 2020Google Scholar Other countries, such as China, have issued guidelines allowing for the use of chloroquine in COVID-19.13Gao J Tian Z Yang X Breakthrough: chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies.Biosci Trends. 2020; 14: 72-73Google Scholar Several countries have been stockpiling the drugs, and shortages of them for approved indications, such as for autoimmune disease and rheumatoid arthritis, have been encountered.10Peschken CA Possible consequences of a shortage of hydroxychloroquine for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus amid the COVID-19 pandemic.J Rheumatol. 2020;  (published online April 8.)DOI:10.3899/jrheum.200395Google Scholar A retrospective observational review of 368 men with COVID-19 treated at the US Veterans Affairs hospitals raised concerns that the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a greater hazard of death; however, the baseline characteristics among the groups analysed were dissimilar and the possibility of bias cannot be ruled out.14Magagnoli J Narendran S Pereira F et al.Outcomes of hydroxychloroquine usage in United States veterans hospitalized with COVID-19.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 23.)

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with concerns of cardiovascular toxicity, particularly because of their known relationship with electrical instability, characterised by QT interval prolongation (the time taken for ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation). This mechanism relates to blockade of the hERG potassium channel,16Traebert M Dumotier B Meister L Hoffmann P Dominguez-Estevez M Suter W Inhibition of hERG K+ currents by antimalarial drugs in stably transfected HEK293 cells.Eur J Pharmacol. 2004; 484: 41-48Google Scholar which lengthens ventricular repolarisation and the duration of ventricular action potentials. Under specific conditions, early after-depolarisations can trigger ventricular arrhythmias.9Giudicessi JR Noseworthy PA Friedman PA Ackerman MJ Urgent guidance for navigating and circumventing the QTc-prolonging and torsadogenic potential of possible pharmacotherapies for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).Mayo Clin Proc. 2020;  (published online April 7.)DOI:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.024Google Scholar Such propensity for arrhythmia provocation is more often seen in individuals with structural cardiovascular disease, and cardiac injury has been reported to occur with high frequency during COVID-19 illness.17Shi S Qin M Shen B et al.Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online March 25.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950Google Scholar,  18Guo T Fan Y Chen M et al.Cardiovascular implications of fatal outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online March 27.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017Google Scholar Furthermore, individuals with cardiovascular disease represent a vulnerable population that experience worse outcomes with COVID-19.19Bonow RO Fonarow GC O'Gara PT Yancy CW Association of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with myocardial injury and mortality.JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online March 27.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1105Google Scholar,  20Mehra MR Desai SS Kuy S Henry TD Patel AN Cardiovascular disease, drug therapy, and mortality in COVID-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online May 1.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621Google Scholar Pathological studies have pointed to derangements in the vascular endothelium and a diffuse endotheliitis noted across multiple organs in COVID-19.21Varga Z Flammer AJ Steiger P et al.Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1417-1418Google Scholar Whether patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and those that experience de-novo cardiovascular injury have a greater predilection to ventricular arrhythmias with chloroquine or its analogues remains uncertain but plausible.

Our study did not examine the QT interval but instead directly analysed the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrythmias. We showed an independent association of the use of either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias. We also note that the hazard of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias increased when the drugs were used in combination with a macrolide. In our analysis, which was dominated by patients from North America, we noted that higher BMI emerged as a risk marker for worse in-hospital survival. Obesity is a known risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.27Lavie CJ Arena R Alpert MA Milani RV Ventura HO Management of cardiovascular diseases in patients with obesity.Nat Rev Cardiol. 2018; 15: 45-56Google Scholar,  28Sanchis-Gomar F Lavie CJ Mehra MR Henry BM Lippi G Obesity and outcomes in COVID-19: when an epidemic and pandemic collide.Mayo Clin Proc. 2020;  (published online May 19.)DOI:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.05.006Google Scholar The most commonly reported arrhythmias are atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Although age, race, and BMI were predictive of an increased risk for death with COVID-19 in our analysis, they were not found to be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias on our multivariable regression analysis. The only variables found to be independently predictive of ventricular arrhythmias were the four treatment regimens, along with underlying cardiovascular disease and COPD. Thus, the presence of cardiovascular comorbidity in the study population could partially explain the observed risk of increased cardiovascular toxicity with the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, especially when used in combination with macrolides. In this investigation, consistent with our previous findings in a smaller cohort of 8910 patients,20Mehra MR Desai SS Kuy S Henry TD Patel AN Cardiovascular disease, drug therapy, and mortality in COVID-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online May 1.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621Google Scholar we found that women and patients being treated with ACE inhibitors (but not angiotensin receptor blockers) or statins had lower mortality with COVID-19. These findings imply that drugs that stabilise cardiovascular function and improve endothelial cell dysfunction might improve prognosis, independent of the use of cardiotoxic drug combinations.21Varga Z Flammer AJ Steiger P et al.Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1417-1418Google Scholar Our study has several limitations. The association of decreased survival with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment regimens should be interpreted cautiously. Due to the observational study design, we cannot exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors, although we have reassuringly noted consistency between the primary analysis and the propensity score matched analyses. Nevertheless, a cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred. These data do not apply to the use of any treatment regimen used in the ambulatory, out-of-hospital setting. Randomised clinical trials will be required before any conclusion can be reached regarding benefit or harm of these agents in COVID-19 patients. We also note that although we evaluated the relationship of the drug treatment regimens with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, we did not measure QT intervals, nor did we stratify the arrhythmia pattern (such as torsade de pointes). We also did not establish if the association of increased risk of in-hospital death with use of the drug regimens is linked directly to their cardiovascular risk, nor did we conduct a drug dose-response analysis of the observed risks. Even if these limitations suggest a conservative interpretation of the findings, we believe that the absence of any observed benefit could still represent a reasonable explanation. In summary, this multinational, observational, real-world study of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation found that the use of a regimen containing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) was associated with no evidence of benefit, but instead was associated with an increase in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and a greater hazard for in-hospital death with COVID-19. These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed.

Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models.MethodsWe did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir–ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656.FindingsBetween Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87–1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95–2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early.InterpretationIn this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits.

Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir–ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87–1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95–2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.

The study was terminated before attaining the prespecified sample size. In the intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint of time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between groups, but was numerically shorter in the remdesivir group than the control group, particularly in those treated within 10 days of symptom onset. The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, although also not significantly different between groups, was numerically shorter in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients.Implications of all the available evidenceNo statistically significant benefits were observed for remdesivir treatment beyond those of standard of care treatment. Our trial did not attain the predetermined sample size because the outbreak of COVID-19 was brought under control in China. Future studies of remdesivir, including earlier treatment in patients with COVID-19 and higher-dose regimens or in combination with other antivirals or SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in those with severe COVID-19 are needed to better understand its potential effectiveness.

Here, we report the results of a placebo-controlled randomised trial of remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19. This was an investigator-initiated, individually randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of intravenous remdesivir in adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. The trial was done at ten hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei, China). Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review boards of each participating hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, or their legal representative if they were unable to provide consent. The trial was done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol is available online. Eligible patients were men and non-pregnant women with COVID-19 who were aged at least 18 years and were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, had pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging, had oxygen saturation of 94% or lower on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and were within 12 days of symptom onset. Eligible patients of child-bearing age (men and women) agreed to take effective contraceptive measures (including hormonal contraception, barrier methods, or abstinence) during the study period and for at least 7 days after the last study drug administration. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breast feeding; hepatic cirrhosis; alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase more than five times the upper limit of normal; known severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min per 1·73 m2) or receipt of continuous renal replacement therapy, haemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis; possibility of transfer to a non-study hospital within 72 h; and enrolment into an investigational treatment study for COVID-19 in the 30 days before screening. The use of other treatments, including lopinavir–ritonavir, was permitted. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either the remdesivir group or the placebo group. Randomisation was stratified according to the level of respiratory support as follows: (1) no oxygen support or oxygen support with nasal duct or mask; or (2) high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The permuted block (30 patients per block) randomisation sequence, including stratification, was prepared by a statistician not involved in the trial using SAS software, version 9.4. Eligible patients were allocated to receive medication in individually numbered packs, according to the sequential order of the randomisation centre (Jin Yin-tan Hospital central pharmacy). Envelopes were prepared for emergency unmasking. Patients received either intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for a total of 10 days (both provided by Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA). Patients were assessed once daily by trained nurses using diary cards that captured data on a six-category ordinal scale and safety from day 0 to 28 or death. Other clinical data were recorded using the WHO–International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) case record form. The safety assessment included daily monitoring for adverse events, clinical laboratory testing (days 1, 3, 7, and 10), 12-lead electrocardiogram (days 1 and 14), and daily vital signs measurements. Clinical data were recorded on paper case record forms and then double entered into an electronic database and validated by trial staff. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, expectorated sputa as available, and faecal or anal swab specimens were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 for viral RNA detection and quantification. The trial was monitored by a contract research organisation (Hangzhou Tigermed Consulting). Virological testing was done at the Teddy Clinical Research Laboratory (Tigermed–DI'AN, Hangzhou, China) using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), detected and quantified by Cobas z480 qPCR (Roche), using LightMix Modular SARS-CoV-2 assays (TIB MOBIOL, Berlin, Germany). At baseline, the upper (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory tract specimens were tested for detection of E-gene, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, and N-gene, then samples on the subsequent visits were quantitatively and qualitative assessed for E-gene. The primary clinical endpoint was time to clinical improvement within 28 days after randomisation. Clinical improvement was defined as a two-point reduction in patients' admission status on a six-point ordinal scale, or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. The six-point scale was as follows: death=6; hospital admission for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation=5; hospital admission for non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy=4; hospital admission for oxygen therapy (but not requiring high-flow or non-invasive ventilation)=3; hospital admission but not requiring oxygen therapy=2; and discharged or having reached discharge criteria (defined as clinical recovery—ie, normalisation of pyrexia, respiratory rate <24 breaths per minute, saturation of peripheral oxygen >94% on room air, and relief of cough, all maintained for at least 72 h)=1. The six-point scale was modified from the seven-point scale used in our previous COVID-19 lopinavir–ritonavir RCT11Cao B Wang Y Wen D et al.A trial of lopinavir–ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online March 18.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2001282Google Scholar by combining the two outpatient strata into one. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of patients in each category of the six-point scale at day 7, 14, and 28 after randomisation; all-cause mortality at day 28; frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation; duration of oxygen therapy; duration of hospital admission; and proportion of patients with nosocomial infection. Virological measures included the proportions of patients with viral RNA detected and viral RNA load (measured by quantitative RT-PCR). Safety outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and premature discontinuations of study drug. The original design required a total of 325 events across both groups, which would provide 80% power under a one-sided type I error of 2·5% if the hazard ratio (HR) comparing remdesivir to placebo is 1·4, corresponding to a change in time to clinical improvement of 6 days assuming that time to clinical improvement is 21 days on placebo. One interim analysis using triangular boundaries23Whitehead J Stratton I Group sequential clinical trials with triangular continuation regions.Biometrics. 1983; 39: 227-236Google Scholar and a 2:1 allocation ratio between remdesivir and placebo had been accounted for in the original design. Assuming an 80% event rate within 28 days across both groups and a dropout rate of 10% implies that about 453 patients should be recruited for this trial (151 on placebo and 302 on remdesivir). The possibility for an interim analysis after enrolment of about 240 patients was included in the design if requested by the independent data safety and monitoring board. The primary efficacy analysis was done on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis with all randomly assigned patients. Time to clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28; no clinical improvement at day 28 or death before day 28 were considered as right censored at day 28. Time to clinical improvement was portrayed by Kaplan-Meier plot and compared with a log-rank test. The HR and 95% CI for clinical improvement and HR with 95% CI for clinical deterioration were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model. Other analyses include subgroup analyses for those receiving treatment 10 days or less vs more than 10 days after symptom onset, time to clinical deterioration (defined as one category increase or death), and for viral RNA load at entry. The differences in continuous variables between the groups was calculated using Hodges-Lehmann estimation. We present adverse event data on the patients' actual treatment exposure, coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Statistical analyses were done using SAS software, version 9.4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 255 patients were screened, of whom 237 were eligible (figure 1). 158 patients were assigned to receive remdesivir and 79 to receive placebo; one patient in the placebo group withdrew their previously written informed consent after randomisation, so 158 and 78 patients were included in the ITT population. No patients were enrolled after March 12, because of the control of the outbreak in Wuhan and on the basis of the termination criteria specified in the protocol, the data safety and monitoring board recommended that the study be terminated and data analysed on March 29. At this stage, the interim analysis was abandoned. When all the other assumptions stayed the same, with the actual enrolment of 236 participants, the statistical power was reduced from 80% to 58%.Figure 1Trial profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) Three patients in the remdesivir group did not start their assigned treatment so were not included in safety analyses (figure 1). The median age of study patients was 65 years (IQR 56–71); sex distribution was 89 (56%) men versus 69 (44%) women in the remdesivir group and 51 (65%) versus 27 (35%) in the placebo group (table 1). The most common comorbidity was hypertension, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease. Lopinavir–ritonavir was co-administered in 42 (18%) patients at baseline. Most patients were in category 3 of the six-point ordinal scale of clinical status at baseline. Some imbalances existed at enrolment between the groups, including more patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease in the remdesivir group than the placebo group. More patients in the control group than in the remdesivir group had been symptomatic for 10 days or less at the time of starting remdesivir or placebo treatment, and a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients had a respiratory rate of more than 24 breaths per min. No other major differences in symptoms, signs, laboratory results, disease severity, or treatments were observed between groups at baseline.Table 1Baseline patient characteristicsRemdesivir group (n=158)Placebo group (n=78)Age, years66·0 (57·0–73·0)64·0 (53·0–70·0)SexMen89 (56%)51 (65%)Women69 (44%)27 (35%)Any comorbidities112 (71%)55 (71%)Hypertension72 (46%)30 (38%)Diabetes40 (25%)16 (21%)Coronary heart disease15 (9%)2 (3%)Body temperature, °C36·8 (36·5–37·2)36·8 (36·5–37·2)Fever56 (35%)31 (40%)Respiratory rate >24 breaths per min36 (23%)11 (14%)White blood cell count, × 109 per LMedian6·2 (4·4–8·3)6·4 (4·5–8·3)4–10108/155 (70%)58 (74%)<427/155 (17%)12 (15%)>1020/155 (13%)8 (10%)Lymphocyte count, × 109 per L0·8 (0·6–1·1)0·7 (0·6–1·2)≥1·049/155 (32%)23 (29%)<1·0106/155 (68%)55 (71%)Platelet count, × 109 per L183·0 (144·0–235·0)194·5 (141·0–266·0)≥100148/155 (95%)75 (96%)<1007/155 (5%)3 (4%)Serum creatinine, μmol/L68·0 (56·0–82·0)71·3 (56·0–88·7)≤133151/154 (98%)76 (97%)>1333/154 (2%)2 (3%)Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L31·0 (22·0–44·0)33·0 (24·0–48·0)≤40109/155 (70%)49 (63%)>4046/155 (30%)29 (37%)Alanine aminotransferase, U/L26·0 (18·0–42·0)26·0 (20·0–43·0)≤50130/155 (84%)66 (85%)>5025/155 (16%)12 (15%)Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L339·0 (247·0–441·5)329·0 (249·0–411·0)≤24536/148 (24%)17/75 (23%)>245112/148 (76%)58/75 (77%)Creatine kinase, U/L75·9 (47·0–131·1)75·0 (47·0–158·0)≤185118/141 (84%)54/67 (81%)>18523/141 (16%)13/67 (19%)National Early Warning Score 2 level at day 15·0 (3·0–7·0)4·0 (3·0–6·0)Six-category scale at day 12—hospital admission, not requiring supplemental oxygen03 (4%)3—hospital admission, requiring supplemental oxygen129 (82%)65 (83%)4—hospital admission, requiring high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive mechanical ventilation28 (18%)9 (12%)5—hospital admission, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive mechanical ventilation01 (1%)6—death1 (1%)0Baseline viral load of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, log10 copies per mL4·7 (0·3)4·7 (0·4)Receiving interferon alfa-2b at baseline29 (18%)15 (19%)Receiving lopinavir–ritonavir at baseline27 (17%)15 (19%)Antibiotic treatment at baseline121 (77%)63 (81%)Corticosteroids therapy at baseline60 (38%)31 (40%)Data are median (IQR), n (%), n/N (%), or mean (SE).

Results for time to clinical improvement were similar in the per-protocol population (median 21·0 days [IQR 13·0–28·0] in the remdesivir group vs 23·0 days [15·0–28·0] in the placebo group HR 1·27 [95% CI 0·89–1·80]; appendix pp 2–3, 5). Although not statistically significant, in patients receiving remdesivir or placebo within 10 days of symptom onset in the ITT population, those receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo (median 18·0 days [IQR 12·0–28·0] vs 23·0 days [15·0–28·0]; HR 1·52 [0·95–2·43]; appendix p 6). If clinical improvement was defined as a one, instead of two, category decline, the HR was 1·34 with a 95% CI of 0·96–1·86 (appendix p 7). For time to clinical deterioration, defined as a one-category increase or death, the HR was 0·95 with a 95% CI of 0·55–1·64 (appendix p 8). 28-day mortality was similar between the two groups (22 [14%] died in the remdesivir group vs 10 (13%) in the placebo group; difference 1·1% [95% CI −8·1 to 10·3]). In patients with use of remdesivir within 10 days after symptom onset, 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the groups, although numerically higher in the placebo group; by contrast, in the group of patients with late use, remdesivir patients had numerically higher 28-day mortality, although there was no significant difference. Clinical improvement rates at days 14 and day 28 were also not significantly different between the groups, but numerically higher in the remdesivir group than the placebo group. For patients assigned to the remdesivir group, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was not significantly different, but numerically shorter than in those assigned to the control group; however, the number of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation was small. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in length of oxygen support, hospital length of stay, days from randomisation to discharge, days from randomisation to death and distribution of six-category scale at day 7, day 14, and day 28 (table 3; appendix p 9). Of 236 patients (158 in the remdesivir group and 78 in the placebo group) who were RT-PCR positive at enrolment, 37 (19%) of the 196 with data available had undetectable viral RNA on the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab taken at baseline. The mean baseline viral load of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs was 4·7 log10 copies per mL (SE 0·3) in the remdesivir group and 4·7 log10 copies per mL (0·4) in the control group (table 1). Viral load decreased over time similarly in both groups (figure 3A). No differences in viral load were observed when stratified by interval from symptom onset to start of study treatment (appendix p 10). In the subset of patients from whom expectorated sputa could be obtained (103 patients), the mean viral RNA load at enrolment was nearly 1-log higher in the remdesivir group than the placebo group at enrolment (figure 3B). When adjusted for baseline sputum viral load at enrolment, the remdesivir group showed no significant difference at day 5 from placebo, but a slightly more rapid decline in load (p=0·0672).Figure 3Viral load by quantitative PCR on the upper respiratory tract specimens (A) and lower respiratory tract specimens (B)Show full captionData are mean (SE).

The cumulative rate of undetectable viral RNA of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs by day 28 was 153 (78%) of 196 patients, and the negative proportion was similar among patients receiving remdesivir and those receiving placebo (appendix p 4). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 patients in the remdesivir group and 50 (64%) of 78 in the control group (table 4). The most common adverse events in the remdesivir group were constipation, hypoalbuminaemia, hypokalaemia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased total bilirubin; and in the placebo group, the most common were hypoalbuminaemia, constipation, anaemia, hypokalaemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased blood lipids, and increased total bilirubin. 28 (18%) serious adverse events were reported in the remdesivir group and 20 (26%) were reported in the control group. More patients in the remdesivir group than the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events or serious adverse events (18 [12%] in the remdesivir group vs four [5%] in the placebo group), among whom seven (5%) were due to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome in the remdesivir group.

COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. Our trial found that intravenous remdesivir did not significantly improve the time to clinical improvement, mortality, or time to clearance of virus in patients with serious COVID-19 compared with placebo. Compared with a previous study of compassionate use of remdesivir,21Grein J Ohmagari N Shin D et al.Compassionate use of remdesivir for patients with severe Covid-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online April 10.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007016Google Scholar our study population was less ill (eg, at the time of enrolment, 0·4% were on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation vs 64% in the previous study) and was treated somewhat earlier in their disease course (median 10 days vs 12 days). Such differences might be expected to favour remdesivir, providing greater effects in our study population, but our results did not meet this expectation. However, our study did not reach its target enrolment because the stringent public health measures used in Wuhan led to marked reductions in new patient presentations in mid-March, and restrictions on hospital bed availability resulted in most patients being enrolled later in the course of disease. Consequently, we could not adequately assess whether earlier remdesivir treatment might have provided clinical benefit. However, among patients who were treated within 10 days of symptom onset, remdesivir was not a significant factor but was associated with a numerical reduction of 5 days in median time to clinical improvement. Ongoing controlled clinical trials are expected to confirm or refute our findings. In one murine model of SARS, remdesivir treatment starting at 2 days after infection, after virus replication and lung airway epithelial damage had already peaked, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-1 lung titres but did not decrease disease severity or mortality.13Sheahan TP Sims AC Graham RL et al.Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses.Sci Transl Med. 2017; 9eaal3653Google Scholar A need for early treatment has been found in non-human primate models of SARS and MERS in which virus replication is very short-lived and lung pathology appears to develop more rapidly than in human infections.17de Wit E Feldmann F Cronin J et al.Prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir (GS-5734) treatment in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020; 117: 6771-6776Google Scholar,  19Williamson BN Feldmann F Schwarz B et al.Clinical benefit of remdesivir in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 22.)

Investigator's brochure of remdesivir, 5th edition. Feb 21, 2020.Google Scholar Doses of 150 mg/day for 14 days have been adequately tolerated in healthy adults, and a daily dose regimen of 150 mg for 3 days followed by 225 mg for 11 days appeared to be generally well tolerated in one patient with Ebola meningoencephalitis.25Jacobs M Rodger A Bell DJ et al.Late Ebola virus relapse causing meningoencephalitis: a case report.Lancet. 2016; 388: 498-503Google Scholar However, the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in severely ill patients, and particularly the concentrations of the active nucleotide metabolite (GS-441524) triphosphate in respiratory tract cells of treated patients, are unknown. Studies of higher-dose regimens for which there are safety data (eg, 150–200 mg daily doses) warrant consideration in severe COVID-19. Our study found that remdesivir was adequately tolerated and no new safety concerns were identified. The overall proportion of patients with serious adverse events tended to be lower in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients. However, a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients had dosing prematurely stopped by the investigators because of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, and vomiting), aminotransferase or bilirubin increases, and worsened cardiopulmonary status. Limitations of our study include insufficient power to detect assumed differences in clinical outcomes, initiation of treatment quite late in COVID-19, and the absence of data on infectious virus recovery or on possible emergence of reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. Of note, in non-human primates, the inhibitory effects of remdesivir on infectious SARS-CoV-2 recovery in bronchoalveolar lavages were much greater than in controls, but viral RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were not consistently decreased versus controls.19Williamson BN Feldmann F Schwarz B et al.Clinical benefit of remdesivir in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 22.)

Furthermore, we have no answer to whether longer treatment course and higher dose of remdesivir would be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19. In summary, we found that this dose regimen of intravenous remdesivir was adequately tolerated but did not provide significant clinical or antiviral effects in seriously ill patients with COVID-19. However, we could not exclude clinically meaningful differences and saw numerical reductions in some clinical parameters. Ongoing studies with larger sample sizes will continue to inform our understanding of the effect of remdesivir on COVID-19. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the antiviral potency of remdesivir (eg, higher-dose regimens, combination with other antivirals, or SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies) and to mitigate immunopathological host responses contributing to COVID-19 severity (eg, inhibitors of IL-6, IL-1, or TNFα) require rigorous study in patients with severe COVID-19.

DOI:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31140-5,Editorial,Reviving the US CDC,/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31140-5/fulltext,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31140-5,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31140-5,N/A,"The Lancet, Vol. 395, No. 10236"," The COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen in the USA with 1·3 million cases and an estimated death toll of 80 684 as of May 12. States that were initially the hardest hit, such as New York and New Jersey, have decelerated the rate of infections and deaths after the implementation of 2 months of lockdown. However, the emergence of new outbreaks in Minnesota, where the stay-at-home order is set to lift in mid-May, and Iowa, which did not enact any restrictions on movement or commerce, has prompted pointed new questions about the inconsistent and incoherent national response to the COVID-19 crisis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flagship agency for the nation's public health, has seen its role minimised and become an ineffective and nominal adviser in the response to contain the spread of the virus. The strained relationship between the CDC and the federal government was further laid bare when, according to The Washington Post, Deborah Birx, the head of the US COVID-19 Task Force and a former director of the CDC's Global HIV/AIDS Division, cast doubt on the CDC's COVID-19 mortality and case data by reportedly saying: “There is nothing from the CDC that I can trust”. This is an unhelpful statement, but also a shocking indictment of an agency that was once regarded as the gold standard for global disease detection and control. How did an agency that was the first point of contact for many national health authorities facing a public health threat become so ill-prepared to protect the public's health? In the decades following its founding in 1946, the CDC became a national pillar of public health and globally respected. It trained cadres of applied epidemiologists to be deployed in the USA and abroad. CDC scientists have helped to discover new viruses and develop accurate tests for them. CDC support was instrumental in helping WHO to eradicate smallpox. However, funding to the CDC for a long time has been subject to conservative politics that have increasingly eroded the agency's ability to mount effective, evidence-based public health responses. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration resisted providing the sufficient budget that the CDC needed to fight the HIV/AIDS crisis. The George W Bush administration put restrictions on global and domestic HIV prevention and reproductive health programming. The Trump administration further chipped away at the CDC's capacity to combat infectious diseases. CDC staff in China were cut back with the last remaining CDC officer recalled home from the China CDC in July, 2019, leaving an intelligence vacuum when COVID-19 began to emerge. In a press conference on Feb 25, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned US citizens to prepare for major disruptions to movement and everyday life. Messonnier subsequently no longer appeared at White House briefings on COVID-19. More recently, the Trump administration has questioned guidelines that the CDC has provided. These actions have undermined the CDC's leadership and its work during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no doubt that the CDC has made mistakes, especially on testing in the early stages of the pandemic. The agency was so convinced that it had contained the virus that it retained control of all diagnostic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but this was followed by the admission on Feb 12 that the CDC had developed faulty test kits. The USA is still nowhere near able to provide the basic surveillance or laboratory testing infrastructure needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. But punishing the agency by marginalising and hobbling it is not the solution. The Administration is obsessed with magic bullets—vaccines, new medicines, or a hope that the virus will simply disappear. But only a steadfast reliance on basic public health principles, like test, trace, and isolate, will see the emergency brought to an end, and this requires an effective national public health agency. The CDC needs a director who can provide leadership without the threat of being silenced and who has the technical capacity to lead today's complicated effort. The Trump administration's further erosion of the CDC will harm global cooperation in science and public health, as it is trying to do by defunding WHO. A strong CDC is needed to respond to public health threats, both domestic and international, and to help prevent the next inevitable pandemic. Americans must put a president in the White House come January, 2021, who will understand that public health should not be guided by partisan politics.

The first case recorded in Brazil was on Feb 25, 2020. But now, Brazil has the most cases and deaths in Latin America (105 222 cases and 7288 deaths as of May 4), and these are probably substantial underestimates. Even more worryingly, the doubling of the rate of deaths is estimated at only 5 days and a recent study by Imperial College (London, UK), which analysed the active transmission rate of COVID-19 in 48 countries, showed that Brazil is the country with the highest rate of transmission (R0 of 2·81). Large cities such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the main hotspots now but there are concerns and early signs that infections are moving inland into smaller cities with inadequate provisions of intensive care beds and ventilators. Yet, perhaps the biggest threat to Brazil's COVID-19 response is its president, Jair Bolsonaro. When asked by journalists last week about the rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, he responded: “So what? What do you want me to do?” He not only continues to sow confusion by openly flouting and discouraging the sensible measures of physical distancing and lockdown brought in by state governors and city mayors but has also lost two important and influential ministers in the past 3 weeks. First, on April 16, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the respected and well liked Health Minister, was sacked after a television interview, in which he strongly criticised Bolsonaro's actions and called for unity, or else risk leaving the 210 million Brazilians utterly confused. Then on April 24, following the removal of the head of Brazil's federal police by Bolsonaro, Justice Minister Sérgio Moro, one of the most powerful figures of the right-wing government and appointed by Bolsonaro to combat corruption, announced his resignation. Such disarray at the heart of the administration is a deadly distraction in the middle of a public health emergency and is also a stark sign that Brazil's leadership has lost its moral compass, if it ever had one. Even without the vacuum of political actions at federal level, Brazil would have a difficult time to combat COVID-19. About 13 million Brazilians live in favelas, often with more than three people per room and little access to clean water. Physical distancing and hygiene recommendations are near impossible to follow in these environments—many favelas have organised themselves to implement measures as best as possible. Brazil has a large informal employment sector with many sources of income no longer an option. The Indigenous population has been under severe threat even before the COVID-19 outbreak because the government has been ignoring or even encouraging illegal mining and logging in the Amazon rainforest. These loggers and miners now risk bringing COVID-19 to remote populations. An open letter on May 3 by a global coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists, and intellectuals, organised by the Brazilian photojournalist Sebastião Salgado, warns of an impending genocide. What are the health and science community and civil society doing in a country known for its activism and outspoken opposition to injustice and inequity and with health as a constitutional right? Many scientific organisations, such as the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and ABRASCO, have long-opposed Bolsonaro because of severe cuts in the science budget and a more general demolition of social security and public services. In the context of COVID-19, many organisations have launched manifestos aimed at the public—such as Pact for Life and Brazil—and written statements and pleas to government officials calling for unity and joined up solutions. Pot-banging from balconies as protest during presidential announcements happens frequently. There is much research going on, from basic science to epidemiology, and there is rapid production of personal protective equipment, respirators, and testing kits. These are hopeful actions. Yet, leadership at the highest level of government is crucial in quickly averting the worst outcome of this pandemic, as is evident from other countries. In our 2009 Brazil Series, the authors concluded: “The challenge is ultimately political, requiring continuous engagement by Brazilian society as a whole to secure the right to health for all Brazilian people.” Brazil as a country must come together to give a clear answer to the “So what?” by its President. He needs to drastically change course or must be the next to go.

The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and features of new cases of Kawasaki-like presentations admitted to our unit during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. We retrospectively reviewed the notes of patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease admitted to the General Paediatric Unit of Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII (Bergamo, Italy), between Jan 1, 2015, and April 20, 2020. Our unit is a tertiary paediatric referral centre with approximately 1300 paediatric admissions per year, serving a province of approximately 1 million people, and hosting the largest Italian paediatric liver transplant programme and the largest paediatric intensive care unit of northern Italy (16 beds). In the general paediatric unit, there are paediatric consultants fully trained in all paediatric subspecialties. Patients with Kawasaki-like presentations were defined according to the 2017 criteria of the American Heart Association, including both the classic type (fever for ≥5 days plus four or more clinical criteria, including bilateral bulbar non-exudative conjunctivitis, changes of the lips or oral cavity, non-suppurative laterocervical lymphadenopathy, polymorphic rash, erythema of the palms and soles, firm induration of the hands or feet, or both) and incomplete types. In incomplete types (fever for ≥5 days plus two or three of the aforementioned clinical criteria), the values of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), or both, were taken as an additional diagnostic criterion in association with the presence of anaemia, thrombocytosis after 7 days of fever, hypoalbuminaemia, hypertransaminasaemia, leucocytosis, sterile pyuria, or an echocardiogram showing coronary aneurysms or cardiac dysfunction (ie, left ventricular function depression, mitral valve regurgitation, or pericardial effusion).17McCrindle BW Rowley AH Newburger JW et al.Diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of Kawasaki disease: a scientific statement for health professionals from the American Heart Association.Circulation. 2017; 135: e927-e999Google Scholar All patients were diagnosed and managed by LV, who has been in charge of paediatric rheumatology in the Paediatric Department since 2010.

Patients and caregivers had nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling, testing SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid using reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR assay; patients with a positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling test were considered confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients diagnosed more recently had a test for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM and IgG) through a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay (NADAL COVID-19 IgG/IgM Test, Nal Von Minden, Moers, Germany). Positivity for IgM or IgG, or both, was considered consistent with an earlier infection with SARS-CoV-2. Risk of resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was ascertained according to the Kobayashi score.20Kobayashi T Saji T Otani T et al.Efficacy of immunoglobulin plus prednisolone for prevention of coronary artery abnormalities in severe Kawasaki disease (RAISE study): a randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoints trial.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1613-1620Google Scholar All patients were administered intravenous immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg. According to the RAISE study,20Kobayashi T Saji T Otani T et al.Efficacy of immunoglobulin plus prednisolone for prevention of coronary artery abnormalities in severe Kawasaki disease (RAISE study): a randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoints trial.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1613-1620Google Scholar based on risk stratification, patients were also treated with aspirin at 50–80 mg/kg per day (Kobayashi score <5) for 5 days or aspirin at 30 mg/kg per day plus methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg per day for 5 days (Kobayashi score ≥5), followed by a tapering of methylprednisolone over 2 weeks. Aspirin was maintained until 48 h after defervescence, and then continued at an antiplatelet dose of 3–5 mg/kg per day for 8 weeks.20Kobayashi T Saji T Otani T et al.Efficacy of immunoglobulin plus prednisolone for prevention of coronary artery abnormalities in severe Kawasaki disease (RAISE study): a randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoints trial.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1613-1620Google Scholar The schedule for patients at risk of intravenous immunglobulin resistance was adopted also in patients with KDSS or MAS. Response to treatment was defined as the normalisation of vital signs, CRP, and blood tests, and the resolution of symptoms and signs. The Student's t test, the χ2 method, and Fisher's exact test were done when appropriate for statistical analysis to compare continuous and categorical variables. A p value of <0·05 was chosen as cutoff for significance. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 20.0) and GraphPad Prism (version 5.00 for Mac). The study was approved by the Bergamo Ethics Committee (registration number 37/20, 25/03/2020). There was no funding source for this study. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Between Feb 18 and April 20, 2020, ten patients (aged 7·5 years [SD 3·5]; seven boys, three girls), were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease (incidence ten per month), and comprised group 2. Admission to hospital occurred, on average, on day 6 of fever (range 4–8). Five (50%) patients presented with a classic form of the disease, and five (50%) presented with an incomplete form. Patients presenting with the classic form had non-exudative conjunctivitis, hand and feet anomalies (ie, erythema or firm induration, or both), and polymorphic rash. Four (80%) of five patients had associated changes of the lips or oral cavity, or both; patient 7 also had laterocervical lymphadenopathy (table 1).Table 1Clinical and laboratory features of ten patients with Kawasaki-like disease who presented over 1 month during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (group 2)Patient 1Patient 2Patient 3Patient 4Patient 5Patient 6Patient 7Patient 8Patient 9Patient 10Date of onsetMarch 17, 2020March 27, 2020March 28, 2020April 3, 2020April 3, 2020April 4, 2020April 6, 2020April 10, 2020April 11, 2020April 14, 2020Age, years8·27·02·97·77·516·05·09·25·55·5SexMaleMaleFemaleFemaleFemaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleType of Kawasaki diseaseIncompleteIncompleteClassicIncompleteIncompleteClassicClassicIncompleteClassicClassicOther symptom..Diarrhoea, meningeal signs..Diarrhoea, meningeal signsDiarrhoeaDiarrhoeaMeningeal signsDiarrhoeaMeningeal signsDiarrhoea, drowsinessESR, mm/h..603910897..51848154Lymphocytes, × 109 per L80310609709304507901870860420460Blood culture..SterileSterileSterileSterileSterileSterileSterileSterileSterileChest x-rayPneumoniaPneumoniaPneumoniaNormalNormalNormalNormalPneumoniaNormalPneumoniaEchocardiographyAbnormalNormalNormalAbnormalAbnormalAbnormalNormalAbnormalNormalAbnormalAneurism>4 mmNoNoNoNoNoNo>4 mmNoNoEjection fraction48%>55%>55%25%30%>55%>55%40%>55%45%Mitral valve regurgitationYesNoNoYesYesNoNoYesNoNoPericardial effusionYesNoNoYesYesYesNoNoNoNoKobayashi ≥5Yes (6)Yes (6)No (4)Yes (6)Yes (6)No (3)No (2)Yes (6)Yes (6)Yes (6)<12 monthsNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoKawasaki disease signs at day 4NoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoCRP ≥10 mg/dLYes (0·9)Yes (31·1)Yes (15·2)Yes (48·0)Yes (52·5)No (7·3)Yes (24·0)Yes (24·2)Yes (24·6)Yes (12·2)Neutrophils ≥80%Yes (80·0)Yes (89·7)No (77·3)Yes (90·0)Yes (90·5)No (79·4)No (77·9)Yes (91·9)Yes (85·5)Yes (83·0)Platelets ≤300 × 109 per LYes (119)Yes (121)Yes (66)Yes (142)Yes (113)Yes (121)Yes (138)Yes (192)Yes (151)Yes (142)Sodium ≤133 mEq/LYes (131)Yes (130)Yes (132)Yes (128)Yes (129)No (135)No (135)Yes (133)Yes (133)Yes (122)ALT ≥100 U/LNo (32)No (79)No (46)No (82)No (78)Yes (733)No (41)No (63)No (20)No (20)MAS18Ravelli A Minoia F Davì S et al.2016 Classification criteria for macrophage activation syndrome complicating systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology/Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation Collaborative Initiative.Ann Rheum Dis. 2016; 75: 481-489Google Scholar..YesYesYesYesYesNoNoNoNoFerritin >684 ng/mL..Yes (1183)Yes (893)Yes (1972)Yes (3213)Yes (2027)No (199)No (449)No (307)No (341)Platelets ≤181 × 109 per LYes (119)Yes (121)Yes (66)Yes (142)Yes (113)Yes (121)Yes (138)No (192)Yes (151)Yes (142)AST >48 IU/LNo (30)Yes (120)Yes (63)Yes (174)Yes (89)Yes (237)Yes (50)Yes (51)No (29)No (30)Triglycerides ≥156 mg/dL−Yes (434)Yes (367)Yes (263)Yes (198)..Yes (161)Yes (200)Yes (171)No (121)Fibrinogen ≤360 mg/dLNo (465)No (599)No (506)No (924)No (759)Yes (313)No (637)No (759)No (759)No (489)KDSS14Kanegaye JT Wilder MS Molkara D et al.Recognition of a Kawasaki disease shock syndrome.Pediatrics. 2009; 123: e783-e789Google ScholarNoNoNoYesYesYesNoYesNoYesHypotensionNoNoNoYesYesYesNoYesNoYesSBP ≤20% basalNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoPeripheral hypoperfusionNoNoNoYesYesNoNoYesNoYesCPK, nv 461–71 IU/L1684762478911979405940Troponin I, nv ≤53 ng/L111188−200355749061236<323proBNP, nv 1–00 ng/L18709521519207216651083472957139927Nasal swab for respiratory pathogensNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNasal swab for SARS-CoV-2NegativePositiveNegativeNegativePositiveNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeSerology for SARS-CoV-2 (IgG, IgM)Negative, negativePositive, negativePositive, negativePositive, positivePositive, positiveNegative, negative** Test done shortly after high-dose IVIG.Positive, negativePositive, negativePositive, positivePositive, negativeSerology (days from onset)3018161111108746Contact with suspected or confirmed caseNoYesNoNoYesNoYesNoYesYesCaregiver nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2..PositiveNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativePositiveNegativeNegativePositiveTreatmentIVIG plus aspirinIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus aspirinIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNInotropesNoNoNoYesYesNoNoNoNoNoResponseYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesESR=erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

In group 2, five (50%) of ten patients were diagnosed with incomplete Kawasaki disease, presenting with three or fewer clinical criteria associated with additional laboratory criteria (n=1) or an abnormal echocardiography (n=4). Two (20%) patients had bulbar non-exudative conjunctivitis; changes of the lips or oral cavity, or both; and polymorphic rash. One (10%) patient had only bulbar non-exudative conjunctivitis and polymorphic rash. In two (20%) patients, the echocardiography detected a left coronary aneurysm (>4 mm), reduced ejection fraction (48% and 40%), and mitral valve regurgitation; patient 1 also had pericardial effusion. Patient 2 met the diagnosis with four additional laboratory criteria (ie, hypoalbuminaemia, hypertransaminasaemia, leucocytosis, and sterile pyuria). Patients 4 and 5 diagnosed with incomplete Kawasaki disease, presented with non-exudative conjunctivitis associated with changes in the lips and oral cavity (patient 4), or polymorphic rash (patient 5). In these patients, echocardiography revealed left ventricular function depression, mitral valve regurgitation, and pericardial effusion; they also required inotropic support. Patient 4 had an underlying diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Chest x-ray, done in all patients in group 2, was positive in five (50%) patients for minimal mono or bilateral infiltrates. Patients 1 and 10 had a chest CT and a confirmed bibasilar pulmonary thickening. Patients 2 and 7, who had meningeal signs, had an electroencephalogram that showed a slow wave pattern; patient 7 had a lumbar puncture revealing normal cerebrospinal fluid and the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Five (50%) of ten patients in group 2 met the criteria for KDSS because of hypotension and clinical signs of hypoperfusion. Two (20%) patients had diarrhoea and meningeal signs, four (40%) had only diarrhoea, and two (20%) had only meningeal signs (table 1). Mean ESR was 72 mm/h (SD 24), mean CRP 25 mg/dL (SD 15·3), and mean ferritin 1176 ng/mL (SD 1032). Full blood count showed a mean white cell count of 10·8 × 109 per L (SD 6·1), with increased neutrophil percentage in eight patients (84·5% [SD 5·7]), lymphopenia in eight patients (0·86 × 109 per L [SD 0·40]), and thrombocytopenia in eight patients (130 × 109 per L [32]). Hyponatraemia (≤133 mEq/L) was observed in eight patients (131 mEq/L [SD 4]) and a slight increase in transaminases was recorded in seven patients (aspartate aminotransferase 87 U/L [SD 70]; alanine aminotransferase 119 U/L [217]). Hypertriglyceridaemia was shown in seven (87%) of eight tested patients in group 2 (239 mg/dL [SD 108]); fibrinogen was high in nine (90%) of ten patients (621 mg/dL [182]), as was D-dimer in eight (80%) of ten patients (3798 ng/mL [SD 1318]). Laboratory criteria predicted intravenous immunoglobulin-resistance in seven (70%) of ten patients. MAS was diagnosed in five (50%) of ten patients. Troponin I was elevated in five (55%) of nine tested patients (1004 ng/L [SD 1862]), creatine phosphokinase in one (10%) of ten patients (85 IU/L [64]), and proBNP in all ten patients (1255 ng/L [929]; Table 1, Table 2).Table 2Comparison between patients with Kawasaki-like disease presenting before and after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemicGroup 1Group 2p valueTime of presentationUntil February, 2020March–April, 2020NANumber of patients1910NAAge at onset, years3·0 (2·5)7·5 (3·5)0·00035Incidence0·3 per month10 per month<0·00001SexNANA0·13Female123NAMale77NAIncomplete Kawasaki disease6/19 (31%)5/10 (50%)0·43CRP, mg/dL16·3 (8·0)25 (15·3)0·05ESR, mm/h82 (29)72 (24)0·38White cell count, × 109 per L19·4 (6·4)10·8 (6·1)0·0017Neutrophils71·9% (17·2)84·5% (5·7)0·034Lymphocytes, × 109 per L3·0 (1·8)0·86 (0·4)0·0012Haemoglobin, g/dL10·8 (2·0)11 (1·2)0·79Platelets, × 109 per L457 (96)130 (32)<0·00001Albumin, g/dLl3·3 (0·5)3·2 (0·3)0·55Sodium, mEq/L134·7 (1·6)130·8 (3·9)0·0011AST, U/L120 (218)87 (70)0·64ALT, U/L92 (122)119 (217)0·67Ferritin, ng/mL187 (89)1176 (1032)0·011Triglycerides, mg/dL..239 (108)..Fibrinogen, mg/dL543 (300)621 (182)0·51D-dimer, ng/mL3244 (943)3798 (1318)0·52CPK, IU/L61 (28)85 (64)0·19Troponin I, ng/L..1004 (1862)..proBNP, ng/L..1255 (929)..Kobayashi score ≥52/19 (10%)7/10 (70%)0·0021MAS18Ravelli A Minoia F Davì S et al.2016 Classification criteria for macrophage activation syndrome complicating systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology/Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation Collaborative Initiative.Ann Rheum Dis. 2016; 75: 481-489Google Scholar0/10 (0%)5/10 (50%)0·021KDSS14Kanegaye JT Wilder MS Molkara D et al.Recognition of a Kawasaki disease shock syndrome.Pediatrics. 2009; 123: e783-e789Google Scholar0/10 (0%)5/10 (50%)0·021Abnormal echocardiography2/19 (10%)6/10 (60%)0·0089Adjunctive steroid treatment4/19 (16%)8/10 (80%)0·0045Inotropes treatment0/19 (0%)2/10 (20%)0·11Response to treatment19/19 (100%)10/10 (100%)1Data are mean (SD) or n/N (%), unless otherwise stated.

NK count was measured in four (40%) patients, and was reduced in all (62 [SD 35]; nv 200–600 × 109 per L). Blood culture was sterile in all patients. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling for SARS-CoV-2, available from Feb 24, 2020, was positive in two (20%) of ten patients in group 2 (table 1). All patients were tested at least twice. Serology for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, available from April 13, 2020, was investigated in all patients in group 2; eight (80%) of ten patients were IgG positive, and three were also IgM positive. Patient 6, who had a negative serology, was tested shortly after the infusion of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (table 1). On April 14, 2020, 31 health-care personnel from the Paediatric Department, Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII (Bergamo, Italy) had serology testing. Nine (29%) of 31 were IgG positive, and three (10%) were also IgM positive, corresponding to the expected rate of exposure of our local heath-care personnel to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, two patients from group 1 diagnosed before the start of the epidemic were contacted and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and both were negative. To date, all patients in group 2 have been discharged, treatment with aspirin at an antiplatelet dose is ongoing, and a follow-up echocardiogram is scheduled at 8 weeks. From Jan 1, 2015, to the start of the epidemic on Feb 17, 2020, 19 children were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease (incidence 0·3 per month; mean age 3 years [SD 2·5]; seven boys, 12 girls); these patients comprised group 1. Admission to hospital occurred, on average, on day 6 of fever (range 4–11 days). 13 (68%) of 19 patients presented with a classic form of the disease, and six (31%) of 19 with an incomplete form. None of the patients had hypotension, clinical signs of hypoperfusion, or other atypical symptoms. Laboratory criteria predicted intravenous immunoglobulin resistance in two (10%) of 19 patients. MAS was not diagnosed in any of the patients. A full comparison of clinical and biochemical characteristics of the two groups is provided in table 2. All patients included had a favourable outcome. Patients in group 1 had concluded their treatment and follow-up period, and recovered completely with no residual coronary artery aneurisms. Group 1 comprised 19 patients diagnosed over 5 years, whereas group 2 included ten patients diagnosed over 1 month (incidence 0·3 per month vs ten per month; p<0·0001; table 2; figure). To rule out the possible effect of number of referrals to the emergency department in different periods, we calculated incidence corrected for number of patients seen at the emergency department. We found that in the past 5 years, from January, 2015, to December, 2019, 98 572 patients had been evaluated, with a mean of 1642 (SD 280) per month, compared with 283 patients per month during the study period—approximately six-fold lower. With these figures, the incidence of Kawasaki disease in group 1 was 0·019% (95% CI −0·002 to 0·0019), compared with 3·5% (−3·5 to 3·6) in group 2 (odds ratio 184; p<0·0001; figure). To rule out the possible effect of a change in the geographical catchment area in the prepandemic (group 1) versus the pandemic (group 2) period, we reviewed the place of residence of all our patients with Kawasaki disease and drew a referral map, showing that all but one came from the Bergamo province (appendix p 1).FigureIncidence of Kawasaki disease in the study period and in the past 5 yearsShow full caption(A) Frequency of Kawasaki disease at the paediatric emergency department of Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo, Italy, in the past 5 years, by case severity.

The average age at onset was 3·0 years (SD 2·5) in group 1 versus 7·5 years (3·5) in group 2 (p=0·0003). In group 1, 14 of 19 patients were white, versus eight of ten patients in group 2. The mean body-mass index of patients in group 1 was 15·93 kg/m2 (SD 1·72) versus 19·11 kg/m2 (SD 3·21) in group 2 (p=0·0016). Two patients tested in group 1 had a negative serology for SARS-CoV-2 versus eight of ten positive patients in group 2 (one of the two negative patients was tested after high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin); five (50%) of ten patients had been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Group 2 had a significantly lower white cell count, lymphocyte count, and platelet count when compared with group 1 (table 2). Group 2 also differed significantly from group 1 for increased rate of markers of severity. An abnormal echocardiogram was recorded in six (60%) of ten patients of group 2 versus two (10%) of 19 patients in group 1 (p=0·0089); fulfilment of criteria for KDSS and MAS was found in five (50%) of ten patients in group 2, and in none of the patients in group 1 (p=0·021). Seven (70%) patients in group 2 met the criteria for a Kobayashi score of 5 or more, compared with two (10%) of 19 patients in group 1 (p=0·0021). Adjunctive steroid treatment was required in four (16%) of 19 patients in group 1 versus eight (80%) of ten patients in group 2 (p=0·0045; table 2).

Group 2, diagnosed after SARS-CoV-2 appeared, showed evidence of seroconversion to the virus in the majority of patients. In the past 20 years, viruses of the coronavirus family have been proposed as possibly implicated in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease.

This report was followed by commentaries expressing a mixed sense of interest and scepticism.30McIntosh K Coronaviruses in the limelight.J Infect Dis. 2005; 191: 489-491Google Scholar The arguments against this association were expressed by a group from Japan, who did a retrospective study31Ebihara T Endo R Ma X Ishiguro N Kikuta H Lack of association between New Haven coronavirus and Kawasaki disease.J Infect Dis. 2005; 192: 351-352Google Scholar,  32Esper F Shapiro ED Landry ML Kahn JS Reply to van der Hoek and Berkhout, Ebihara et al., and Belay et al.J Infect Dis. 2005; 192: 353Google Scholar,  33Turnier JL Anderson MS Heizer HR Jone PN Glodé MP Dominguez SR Concurrent respiratory viruses and Kawasaki disease.Pediatrics. 2015; 136: e609-e614Google Scholar on nasopharyngeal swab samples from 19 children with Kawasaki disease and 208 controls with respiratory tract infections, and found RNA sequences of HCoV-NH in five (2%) of 208 controls versus zero of 19 children with Kawasaki disease. Another group from Japan explored the association between two different coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) and Kawasaki disease by serological tests. The immunofluorescence assay detected no difference in HCoV-NL63 antibody positivity between patients and controls, whereas HCoV-229E antibody positivity was higher in patients with Kawasaki disease.34Shirato K Imada Y Kawase M Nakagaki K Matsuyama S Taguchi F Possible involvement of infection with human coronavirus 229E, but not NL63, in Kawasaki disease.J Med Virol. 2014; 86: 2146-2153Google Scholar Given the pathogenesis of the disease, serology testing seems a more reliable tool than RT-PCR in detecting the cause of infection. This suggests that the coronavirus family might represent one of the triggers of Kawasaki disease, SARS-CoV-2 being a particularly virulent strain able to elicit a powerful immune response in the host. In this study, the clinical and biochemical features of patients with Kawasaki disease diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to differ from our historical cohort of patients; therefore, we have classified these patients as Kawasaki-like disease. From a clinical perspective, they were older, had respiratory and gastrointestinal involvement, meningeal signs, and signs of cardiovascular involvement. From a biochemical perspective, they had leucopenia with marked lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased ferritin, as well as markers of myocarditis. Similar clinical features are shared by patients with COVID-19.4Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Additionally, these patients had a more severe disease course, with resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin and need of adjunctive steroids, biochemical evidence of MAS, and clinical signs in keeping with KDSS. The proinflammatory effect of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in adults with the most severe respiratory complications of COVID-19.35McGonagle D Sharif K O'Regan A Bridgewood C The role of cytokines including interleukin-6 in COVID-19 induced pneumonia and macrophage activation syndrome-like disease.Autoimmun Rev. 2020;  (published online April 3.)DOI:10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102537Google Scholar,  36Molloy EJ Bearer CF COVID-19 in children and altered inflammatory responses.Pediatr Res. 2020;  (published online April 3.)DOI:10.1038/s41390-020-0881-yGoogle Scholar Many of these patients have a constellation of features classified under the term cytokine storm, such as fever, lymphopenia, elevated transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and ferritin, in keeping with MAS.11Mehta P McAuley DF Brown M Sanchez E Tattersall RS Manson JJ COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1033-1034Google Scholar,  35McGonagle D Sharif K O'Regan A Bridgewood C The role of cytokines including interleukin-6 in COVID-19 induced pneumonia and macrophage activation syndrome-like disease.Autoimmun Rev. 2020;  (published online April 3.)DOI:10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102537Google Scholar,  37Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062Google Scholar Likewise, MAS is a form of cytokine storm, and might affect patients with Kawasaki disease.9Henderson LA Canna SW Schulert GS et al.On the alert for cytokine storm: immunopathology in COVID-19.Arthritis Rheumatol. 2020;  (published online April 15.)DOI:10.1002/art.41285Google Scholar,  15Wang W Gong F Zhu W Fu S Zhang Q Macrophage activation syndrome in Kawasaki disease: more common than we thought?.Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2015; 44: 405-410Google Scholar All these elements supported the need to start adjunctive steroids. In our experience, this treatment is effective and safe, and should be considered by physicians treating patients with Kawasaki-like presentations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence of contact with the virus was confirmed by the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in eight of ten patients in group 2. It is possible that in the remaining two patients, who both had a negative serology, confounding factors played a role. One patient was tested just after an infusion of high-dose immunoglobulins. Additionally, qualitative antibody testing is reported to have a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 85–90% when compared with PCR test by nasal swab. It is also possible that this patient represents an usual presentation of Kawasaki disease outside of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, as seen in previous years. Only two patients in group 2 presented a positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling for SARS-CoV-2. This finding and the positivity of IgG antibodies suggest a late onset of the disease compared with the primary infection, due to the host immune response. This might be the reason why, in the past, no active viral infection could be shown in this disease. All these results and considerations support the hypothesis that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a Kawasaki-like disease in susceptible patients. We believe these findings have important implications for public health. The association between SARS-CoV-2 and Kawasaki-like disease should be taken into account when it comes to considering social reintegration policies for the paediatric population. However, the Kawasaki-like disease described here remains a rare condition, probably affecting no more than one in 1000 children exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This estimate is based on the limited data from the case series in this region. This study has the limitations of a relatively small case series, requiring confirmation in larger groups. Genetic studies investigating the susceptibility of patients developing this disease to the triggering effect of SARS-CoV-2 should be done. Nonetheless, we reported a strong association between an outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease and the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the Bergamo province of Italy. Patients diagnosed with Kawasaki-like disease after the viral spreading revealed a severe course, including KDSS and MAS, and required adjunctive steroid treatment. A similar outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease is expected in countries affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Our search did not show any randomised controlled trials assessing a combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Added value of this studyThis is the first randomised controlled trial on the triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin, compared with single-drug lopinavir–ritonavir in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Treatment with the triple combination effectively suppressed viral load in all clinical specimens, including the nasopharyngeal swab, throat saliva, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and stool in most patients 8 days from treatment commencement, which was significantly shorter than the time taken in the control group, treated with lopinavir–ritonavir alone. The triple combination also alleviated symptoms completely within 4 days—a significantly shorter time than the control. The triple combination also suppressed IL-6 levels. The clinical and virological efficacy resulted in shorter hospital stays and facilitated infection control. This treatment regimen was also shown to be safe, with minor and self-limiting gastrointestinal adverse events of diarrhoea and vomiting. Increased liver enzymes were uncommon, and resolved upon stopping the medications.Implications of all the available evidenceThis study showed that early treatment with the triple combination of antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin is safe and highly effective in shortening the duration of virus shedding, decreasing cytokine responses, alleviating symptoms, and facilitating the discharge of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Furthermore, the triple antiviral therapy rapidly rendered viral load negative in all specimens, thereby reducing infectiousness of the patient.

Furthermore, the triple antiviral therapy rapidly rendered viral load negative in all specimens, thereby reducing infectiousness of the patient. This was a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial. Adult patients aged at least 18 years admitted to hospital from Feb 10, 2020, for virologically confirmed COVID-19, were recruited from the Queen Mary Hospital, Pamela Youde Nethersole Hospital, Ruttonjee Hospital, United Christian Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and Tuen Mun Hospital in Hong Kong. These six major public hospitals are positioned across five of the seven hospital clusters, and serve 75% of the 7·5 million population. Public health ordinance in Hong Kong required all patients tested positive for COVID-19 be admitted to hospital. Eligibility criteria for the study were age at least 18 years, a national early warning score 2 (NEWS2) of at least 1, and symptom duration of 14 days or less upon recruitment (appendix pp 9–10). The institutional review board of the University of Hong Kong Hospital Authority approved this study (UW20–074). All patients gave written consent for participation in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to either the triple combination lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta-1b group or the control group (lopinavir–ritonavir only), in the ratio of 2:1, by simple randomisation with no stratification. Randomised treatment was open-label. Patients were assigned to a serial number by the study coordinator. Each serial number was linked to a computer-generated randomisation list assigning the antiviral treatment regimens. The study medications were dispensed by the hospital pharmacy and then to the patients by the medical ward nurses. In the combination group, patients who were recruited and treated less than 7 days from symptom onset received a triple combination of 14 days of oral lopinavir–ritonavir (lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg) every 12 h (via nasogastric tube to intubated patients), ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and subcutaneous injection of one to three doses of interferon beta-1b 1 mL (8 million international units [IU]) on alternate days depending on the day of drug commencement (if commenced on day 1–2 from symptom onset, the patient received all three doses of interferon beta-1b; if commenced on day 3–4, the patient received two doses; if commenced on day 5–6, the patient received one dose). For those recruited and treated between days 7 and 14, interferon beta-1b injection was omitted to avoid its proinflammatory effects. Patients assigned to the control group received only oral lopinavir–ritonavir (lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg) every 12 h for 14 days. For patients who had no history of prolonged QTc syndrome, but were found to have prolonged QTc less than 480 ms, first-degree heart block or bundle branch block, or bradycardia upon ECG examination, and those who developed increased alanine transaminase of three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), the lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was reduced to once per day. Lopinavir–ritonavir would be stopped if alanine transaminase levels exceeded six times the ULN. The randomisation window from symptom onset was extended from 10 to 14 days after trial commencement after knowing that the incubation period could go beyond 14 days. Because a placebo group was generally not accepted in Chinese culture, and our previous study showed that interferon beta-1b and lopinavir–ritonavir are active against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, lopinavir–ritonavir was used in the control group whereas interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin were used in the combination group for patients admitted less than 7 days from symptom onset. The intervention treatment had to be started within 48 h after hospital admission. Standard of care included oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, dialysis support, and antimicrobial treatment for secondary bacterial infection as indicated clinically. Stress doses of corticosteroid (50 mg hydrocortisone every 8 h intravenously, tapering over 7 days) were given to patients who developed oxygen desaturation and required oxygen support. Non-invasive or invasive ventilatory support beyond day 7 from symptom onset was at the discretion of the consultants. Clinical findings including history and physical examination, and laboratory and radiological investigation results were entered into a predesigned database. Chest radiograph and ECG were taken at baseline and at regular intervals for monitoring of patient progress and to detect early cardiac rhythm changes. Patients with underlying cardiac conditions were put on cardiac monitoring. High-resolution CT was done at the consultants' discretion. All patients were followed up at the infectious disease clinic within 30 days after discharge. Initial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made upon admission. All recruited patients had to have laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR in the nasopharyngeal swab. Daily nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, stool or rectal swabs, and urine if available, were obtained until discharge, for quantification of viral load and genetic mutation testing (appendix pp 20–23). Complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and cytokine profile were regularly checked until discharge (appendix p 21). Blood and urine samples for bacterial culture were taken when clinically indicated. The nasopharyngeal swab upon admission was assessed by BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 plus (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Methods for assays by quantitative RT-PCR, serum cytokine profiling, and nanopore sequencing for nsp5 mutation are in the appendix (pp 20–23). The primary endpoint was time to achieve a negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Secondary clinical endpoints were time to resolution of symptoms defined as a NEWS2 of 0 maintained for 24 h; daily NEWS2 and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; length of hospital stay; and 30-day mortality. Other virological endpoints included the time to achieve negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in all clinical samples, including nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, stool, and urine; daily viral load changes in the first 7 days; and emergence of amino acid mutations in the nsp5 gene encoding a 3C-like protease. The serum cytokine response was also measured. Safety endpoints were the frequencies and duration of adverse events. It is important to note that COVID-19 is a new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is phylogenetically closest to the 2003 SARS-CoV. At the time of study design in mid-January, 2020, there was insufficient information on the mortality of COVID-19. Thus, we based our sample size calculation on our own findings of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment in a trial on the 2003 SARS-CoV.7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar The current study was designed on the basis of an estimated difference of 26·4% in the 21-day mortality or acute respiratory distress syndrome rate in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, when treated with lopinavir–ritonavir (2·4%) versus historical controls without antiviral treatment (28·8%). The necessary sample size had been calculated to be 30 patients per group to detect such a difference at a two-sided α level of 0·05, with 80% power. The protocol proposed recruiting at least 35 patients per group to allow for a 17% dropout rate. The primary endpoint was assessed in the intention-to-treat population of all randomised patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned drug. Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test and continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, for both intention-to-treat and subgroup analyses. For viral load, specimens with undetectable viral load were assigned a value of 1 log10 copies per mL for the purpose of statistical analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model. Factors significant at univariable analysis (p<0·10) were further assessed by means of a multivariable analysis by Cox proportional hazards model to identify the independent factors for negative nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR on day 7 after treatment. A p value of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version 26.0 and PRISM, version 8.

Between Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 144 patients were screened, and 127 patients were recruited (figure 1). The number of patients screened accounted for 80% of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong during this period. Nine patients did not fulfil the inclusion criteria (four with second-degree and third-degree cardiac arrhythmia, two with severe depression, and three because of pregnancy) and eight patients declined the treatment regimen. One patient in the control group required discontinuation of lopinavir–ritonavir because of alanine transaminase six times greater than the ULN after 1 week of treatment. The median age was 52 years (IQR 32–62); 68 (54%) patients were men versus 59 (46%) women (table 1). 51 (40%) patients had underlying diseases. The median time to hospital admission from symptom onset was 5 days (IQR 3–7).Figure 1Trial profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT)Table 1Baseline demographics of the study populationCombination group (n=86)Control group (n=41)Age51·0 (31·0–61·3)52·0 (33·5–62·5)SexMen45 (52%)23 (56%)Women41 (48%)18 (44%)Time from symptoms onset to start of treatment, days5 (4–7)4 (3–8)Underlying diseasesDiabetes11 (13%)6 (15%)Hypertension23 (27%)13 (32%)Coronary artery disease5 (6%)5 (12%)Cerebrovascular disease1 (1%)1 (2%)Hyperlipidaemia18 (21%)11 (27%)Thyroid disease3 (3%)1 (2%)Obstructive sleep apnoea1 (1%)1 (2%)Crohn's disease1 (1%)0Epilepsy1 (1%)0Tuberculosis2 (2%)0Chronic hepatitis B2 (2%)1 (2%)Chronic hepatitis C01 (2%)Malignancy1 (1%)1 (2%)Smoker6 (7%)1 (2%)Symptoms and signsFever70 (81%)32 (78%)Chills13 (15%)6 (15%)Cough45 (52%)23 (56%)Sputum29 (34%)13 (32%)Shortness of breath7 (8%)7 (17%)Sore throat16 (19%)10 (24%)Myalgia10 (12%)8 (20%)Malaise19 (22%)5 (12%)Nausea or vomiting1 (1%)0Diarrhoea17 (20%)7 (17%)Rhinorrhoea14 (16%)10 (24%)Anosmia4 (5%)1 (2%)Headache3 (3%)3 (7%)Chest tightness2 (2%)0Anorexia1 (1%)0Baseline laboratory findings (normal range)Haemoglobin (11·5–14·8 g/dL)13·4 (12·7–14·9)13·5 (12·7–14·8)White cell count (3·89–9·93 × 109 per L)4·9 (3·7–6·2)5·4 (4·6–6·4)Neutrophils (2·01–7·42 × 109 per L)3·4 (2·4–4·3)3·5 (2·9–4·5)Lymphocytes (1·06–3·61 × 109 per L)1·0 (0·8–1·5)1·3 (0·9–1·6)Platelets (154–371 × 109 per L)195·0 (171·8–260·0)192·0 (160·5–244·5)Alanine aminotransferase (8–45 U/L)23·0 (15·0–33·3)26·0 (14·5–43·0)Alkaline phosphatase (42–110 U/L)58·0 (48·0–75·0)65·0 (52·5–75·0)Lactate dehydrogenase (143–280 U/L)194·0 (159·8–249·0)167·5 (142·0–200·0)Bilirubin (4–23 μmol/L)7·9 (5·5–9·0)7·5 (6·0–10·8)Creatinine (49–82 μmol/L)75·5 (65·0–92·0)76·0 (62·5–96·0)Urea (2·9–8·0 mmol/L)4·0 (2·9–4·8)3·7 (2·7–4·6)Creatine kinase (22–198 U/L)79·0 (50·0–151·0)90·5 (54·5–141·5)C-reactive protein (<0·76 mg/dL)3·0 (2·0–9·2)3·0 (1·5–7·2)Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (<12 mm/h)19·0 (11·0–48·0)19·0 (9·8–37·8)Baseline radiological findings (%)Abnormal chest x-ray64 (74%)32 (78%)Right upper zone infiltrate00 (0%)Right middle zone infiltrate4 (5%)6 (15%)Right lower zone infiltrate38 (44%)18 (44%)Left upper zone infiltrate1 (1%)0Left middle zone infiltrate7 (8%)7 (17%)Left lower zone infiltrate27 (31%)10 (24%)High-resolution CT (performed in 22 patients)14 (16%)6 (15%)Data are n (%) or median (IQR).

U/L=units per L. Among the 127 patients, 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 patients were assigned to the control group. Within the combination group, 52 patients were admitted to hospital less than 7 days from symptom onset and received the lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta-1b regimen, and 34 patients who were admitted 7 days or more after symptom onset received the lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin only regimen. The median number of doses of interferon beta-1b received was two. Median time from symptom onset to start of treatment was 5 days (4–7) for the combination group and 4 days (3–8) for the control group (table 1). The age, sex, and baseline demographics in each group were similar. Fever and unproductive cough were the most common presenting signs and symptoms. Both diarrhoea and anosmia were infrequent. Most patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate upon presentation. One patient in the combination group had concomitant rhinovirus infection upon presentation. Disease severity upon presentation was mild based on NEWS2 and SOFA scores (table 2).Table 2Clinical, viral load, and cytokine profile and concomitant treatmentsCombination group (n=86)Control group (n=41)p valueNEWS2Baseline2 (1–2)2 (2–2)0·52Day 11 (1–2)2 (2–2)<0·0001Day 21·0 (0·0–2·0)2·0 (1·5–3·0)<0·0001Day 30 (0–1)2 (1–3)<0·0001Day 40 (0–1)2 (1–2)<0·0001Day 50 (0–1)2 (1–2)<0·0001Day 60·0 (0·0–1·0)1·5 (1·0–2·0)<0·0001Day 70·0 (0·0–1·0)1·0 (0·8–2·0)0·0010Time to NEWS2 of 0, days4 (3–8)8 (7–9)<0·0001SOFA scoreBaseline0 (0–1)0 (0–1)0·38Day 10 (0–1)0 (1–1)0·21Day 20 (0–2)1 (0–2)0·025Day 30 (0–2)1 (0–2)0·010Day 40·0 (0·0–1·3)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·012Day 50 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·010Day 60 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·035Day 70 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·028Time to SOFA score of 0, days3·0 (1·0–8·0)8·0 (6·5–9·0)0·041Duration of hospital stay, days9·0 (7·0–13·0)14·5 (9·3–16·0)0·01630-day mortality0 (0)0 (0)1·00Time to negative viral load, daysNasopharyngeal swab7 (5–11)12 (8–15)0·0010Posterior oropharyngeal saliva6·0 (3·0–8·0)8·0 (5·3–10·8)0·044Throat swab4·5 (1·3–6·8)7·0 (3·0–12·0)0·039Stool5 (2–5)7 (4–8)0·030All specimens8 (6–12)13 (8–15)0·0010Virological findings (RT-PCR), log10 copies per mLNasopharyngeal swab (baseline)6·4 (4·5–8·0)6·4 (3·9–7·7)0·70Posterior oropharyngeal saliva (baseline)** Stress-dose steroid was hydrocortisone 50 mg every 8 h intravenously, tapered over 5–7 days.5·2 (3·8–7·0)5·3 (4·3–7·1)0·54Throat swab (baseline)4·6 (2·9–6·1)4·5 (3·7–5·7)0·85Stool (baseline)3·3 (2·7–5·3)3·8 (2·6–7·3)0·53Cytokine concentration, log10 pg/mLIL-6 (baseline)1·4 (1·0–1·4)1·4 (1·0–1·6)0·43TNFα (baseline)1 (1–1)1 (1–1)1·00Concomitant treatmentsOxygen therapy12 (14%)5 (12%)0·72Non-invasive ventilator support3 (3%)2 (5%)0·75Ventilator support01 (2%)0·15Antibiotics44 (51%)25 (61%)0·33Amoxicillin–clavulanate29 (34%)21 (51%)0·080Azithromycin7 (8%)4 (10%)0·76Ceftriaxone12 (14%)8 (20%)0·42Doxycycline13 (15%)8 (20%)0·53Levofloxacin11 (13%)3 (7%)0·36Piperacillin–tazobactam5 (6%)00·12Corticosteroid (stress dose)** Stress-dose steroid was hydrocortisone 50 mg every 8 h intravenously, tapered over 5–7 days.6 (7%)2 (5%)0·65Data are median (IQR) or n (%).

For the primary endpoint of time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab, the combination group had a significantly shorter median time (7 days [IQR 5–11]) than the control group (12 days [8–15]; HR 4·37 [95% CI 1·86–10·24], p=0·0010; table 2). Clinical improvement was significantly better in the combination group, with a significantly shorter time to complete alleviation of symptoms, defined as a NEWS2 of 0 (4 days [IQR 3–8] in the combination group vs 8 days [7–9] in the control group; HR 3·92 [95% CI 1·66–9·23], p<0·0001) and SOFA score of 0 (3·0 days [1·0–8·0] vs 8·0 days [6·5–9·0]; HR 1·89 [1·03–3·49], p=0·041; table 2). A similar pattern was observed on the daily NEWS2 (all p<0·0001; figure 2A) and daily SOFA score after treatment (all p<0·05 except day 1 [p=0·21]; table 2). The significantly better clinical and virological response is also reflected in the shorter median hospital stay in the combination group than in the control group (9·0 days [7·0–13·0] vs 14·5 days [9·3–16·0]; HR 2·72 [1·2–6·13], p=0·016).Figure 2Outcomes over timeShow full caption(A) National early warning score 2; (B) nasopharyngeal swab viral load; (C) posterior oropharyngeal saliva viral load; (D) throat swab viral load; (E) stool viral load; and (F) serum IL-6 cytokine concentration (first 60 recruited patients).

Data points are medians and error bars are IQRs. For the virological outcome, the combination treatment was associated with significantly shorter time to negative viral load in all specimens when assessed individually (nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool samples) as well as in all specimens combined (table 2). All urine samples tested negative for viral load. All patients had a SARS-CoV-2 positive baseline nasopharyngeal swab. With regards to the other clinical samples, 108 (85%) patients provided posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples, 99 (78%) provided throat swabs, 36 (28%) provided stool samples, and 83 (65%) provided urine samples. The baseline viral loads for all specimens were similar between the combination group and control group (table 2). The nasopharyngeal swab viral load was significantly lower in the combination group than in the control group from day 1 to day 7 after treatment (figure 2B). Similar results were found in the posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool specimens after treatment (figure 2C–E). Post-hoc subgroup comparison of the 76 patients who started treatment less than 7 days after onset of symptoms showed better clinical and virological outcomes in the combination group (52 patients, receiving lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta-1b) than in the control group (24 patients; table 3) across all measured variables except stool samples. However, no significant differences between the treatment groups were measured in these outcomes in the 51 patients who were treated 7 days or more after symptom onset (34 in the combination group [receiving lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin only] and 17 in the control group; appendix p 31).Table 3Subgroup analysis of clinical, viral load, and cytokine profileStarted treatment <7 days from symptom onsetStarted treatment ≥7 days from symptom onsetCombination group (with interferon beta-1b; n=52)Control group (n=24)p valueCombination group (without interferon beta-1b; n=34)Control group (n=17)p valueNEWS2Baseline2 (1–2)2 (2–2)0·112 (1–2)2 (1–2)0·49Day 11 (1–1)2 (2–2)<0·00012 (1–2)2 (1–2)0·71Day 21·0 (0·0–1·0)2·0 (1·5–3·0)<0·00011·5 (1·0–2·0)2·0 (1·0–2·8)0·41Day 30·0 (0·0–1·0)2·0 (1·0–3·0)<0·00011·0 (1·0–2·0)2·0 (0·3–2·8)0·16Day 40·0 (0·0–0·0)2·0 (1·0–2·5)<0·00011·0 (1·0–2·0)2·0 (0·3–2·0)0·37Day 50 (0–0·5)2 (1–2)<0·00011 (0–1)2 (0–2)0·040Day 60 (0–0·3)1 (1–2)<0·00011 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·14Day 70 (0–0)1 (0–2)<0·00011 (0–1)1 (0–1)0·68Time to NEWS2 of 0, days4·0 (3·0–5·0)8·0 (6·5–9·0)<0·00016·0 (5·0–10·8)8·0 (5·5–8·0)0·90SOFA scoreBaseline0 (0–1)0 (0–1)0·991 (0–1)0 (0–1)0·17Day 10·0 (0·0–1·0)1·0 (0·0–1·0)0·0301·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–1·5)0·67Day 20 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·00601 (0–2)1 (0–2)0·72Day 30 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·00501 (0–2)1 (0–3)0·49Day 40 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·00601 (0–2)1 (0–3)0·48Day 50·0 (0·0–0·8)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·00301·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–3·0)0·55Day 60·0 (0·0–0·0)0·5 (0·0–2·0)0·00101·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·88Day 70·0 (0·0–0·0)0·5 (0·0–2·0)<0·00011·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·88Time to SOFA score of 0, days3 (1–5)7 (1–9)0·00108 (1–8)8 (1–9)0·23Duration of hospital stay, days8 (6–12·5)15 (9–16)0·003013 (8–15)13·5 (12·3–21·8)0·09030-day mortality0 (0)0 (0)1·000 (0)0 (0)1·00Time to negative viral load, daysNasopharyngeal swab6·5 (4·0–8·0)12·5 (8·0–14·8)<0·000110·5 (8·0–12·3)12·0 (8·0–17·0)0·10Posterior oropharyngeal saliva6·0 (2·0–7·0)8·5 (5·3–11·8)<0·00018·0 (6·0–9·0)8·0 (5·3–9·0)0·79Throat swab4·0 (1·0–6·0)8·0 (3·3–12·8)0·00105·0 (1·5–8·0)4·5 (2·0–9·0)0·52Stool4·5 (2·0–5·0)6·0 (3·0–7·0)0·0705·0 (2·0–10·0)7·0 (5·5–8·5)0·14All specimens7·0 (4·0–9·0)13·0 (8·0–14·0)<0·000112·0 (7·8–14·0)12·0 (12·0–19·0)0·080Virological findings (RT-PCR), log10 copies per mLNasopharyngeal swab (baseline)7 (5·2–8·4)6·1 (4·3–7·7)0·295·5 (3·8–7·3)6·6 (3·8–8)0·65Posterior oropharyngeal saliva (baseline)5·4 (3·9–7·3)5·3 (3·9–7·5)0·864·8 (3·8–6·2)5·4 (4·9–6·8)0·30Throat swab (baseline)4·8 (3·2–6·9)4·4 (3·5–6·1)0·814·5 (1·0–5·6)5·0 (4·0–5·5)0·52Stool (baseline)3·2 (1·9–6·2)3·2 (2·9–5·6)0·853·3 (2·8–3·9)5·6 (1·9–7·4)0·48Cytokine concentration, log10 pg/mLIL-6 (baseline)1·4 (1–1·5)1·4 (1·4–1·6)0·131·4 (1–1·4)1 (1–1·6)0·45TNFα (baseline)1 (1–1)1 (1–1)0·871 (1–1)1 (1–1)0·82Data are median (IQR).

NEWS2=national early warning score 2. SOFA=sequential organ failure assessment. 17 (13%) of 127 patients developed oxygen desaturation and required oxygen treatment (table 2). Six (5%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, of whom five required non-invasive ventilator support and one 96-year-old female patient with a past medical history of coronary artery disease required intubation and ventilator support. She was in the control group and was successfully extubated after 10 days of intensive care. 69 (54%) patients received concomitant antibiotics. Eight (6%) patients were given stress doses of corticosteroids in the second week from symptom onset. The serum cytokine profile was analysed in the first 84 recruited patients. The IL-6 concentration in the combination group was significantly lower than in the control group on days 2, 6, and 8 (figure 2F). TNFα concentrations and IL-10 concentrations were not significantly different between the groups. No significant nsp5 mutations were identified in serial nasopharyngeal swab samples. Multivariable analysis showed that the combination group and having a normal baseline chest x-ray were independently associated with day 7 negative nasopharyngeal swab viral load. Of the two, the combination group was the most significant independent factor (HR 4·27 [95% CI 1·82–10·02], p=0·0010; appendix p 30). Adverse events were reported by 41 (48%) of 86 patients in the combination group and 20 (49%) of 41 patients in the control group. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea (52 [41%] of 127 patients), fever (48 [38%] patients), nausea (43 [34%]) and raised alanine transaminase level (18 [14%]; table 4). These side-effects mostly resolved within 3 days after drug initiation. Sinus bradycardia was reported by four (3%) patients. There were no differences between incidence of any of the adverse events or durations of nausea or diarrhoea between the treatment groups. The peak median alanine transaminase concentration was 38·0 units per L (24·5–62·5) and peak median bilirubin was 22·0 μmol/L (17·0–32·5), in all patients. No serious adverse events were reported in the combination group. One patient in the control group had a serious adverse event of impaired hepatic enzymes requiring discontinuation of treatment. No patients died during the study.Table 4Adverse events in the study populationCombination group (n=86)Control group (n=41)p valueAdverse eventsNausea30 (35%)13 (32%)0·87Diarrhoea34 (40%)18 (44%)0·54Increased alanine aminotransferase11 (13%)7 (17%)0·32Hyperbilirubinaemia4 (5%)3 (7%)0·54Sinus bradycardia3 (4%)1 (2%)0·77Fever32 (37%)16 (39%)0·73Serious adverse events01 (2%)0·15Duration of nausea, days2 (1–2)2 (1–2)0·80Duration of diarrhoea, days3 (3–3)3 (3–3)0·88                            Open table in a new tab                         In this multicentre randomised open-label phase 2 trial in patients with COVID-19, we showed that a triple combination of an injectable interferon (interferon beta-1b), oral protease inhibitor (lopinavir–ritonavir), and an oral nucleoside analogue (ribavirin), when given within 7 days of symptom onset, is effective in suppressing the shedding of SARS-CoV-2, not just in a nasopharyngeal swab, but in all clinical specimens, compared with lopinavir–ritonavir alone. Furthermore, the significant reductions in duration of RT-PCR positivity and viral load were associated with clinical improvement as shown by the significant reduction in NEWS2 and duration of hospital stay. Most patients treated with the triple combination were RT-PCR negative in all specimens by day 8. The side-effects were generally mild and self-limiting. Specific highly active antiviral drugs are always needed for any novel emerging infectious disease because the development of a new antiviral takes years before its approval for clinical use. Therefore, drug repurposing by testing existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that have been used to treat other viral infections is the most feasible approach in a pandemic. Many drugs have been shown to have some in-vitro activity against betacoronaviruses, including remdesivir, favipiravir, nitazoxanide, camostat mesilate, interferons, lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and convalescent plasma containing neutralising antibodies.5Chen F Chan KH Jiang Y et al.In vitro susceptibility of 10 clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus to selected antiviral compounds.J Clin Virol. 2004; 31: 69-75Google Scholar,  6Chan JF Chan KH Kao RY et al.Broad-spectrum antivirals for the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect. 2013; 67: 606-616Google Scholar,  7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar,  8Chan JF Yao Y Yeung ML et al.Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir or interferon-β1b improves outcome of MERS-CoV infection in a nonhuman primate model of common marmoset.J Infect Dis. 2015; 212: 1904-1913Google Scholar,  13Agostini ML Andres EL Sims AC et al.Coronavirus susceptibility to the antiviral remdesivir (GS-5734) is mediated by the viral polymerase and the proofreading exoribonulcease.MBio. 2018; 9: e00221-e00318Google Scholar,  14Li G De Clercq E Therapeutic options for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020; 19: 149-150Google Scholar,  15Wang M Cao R Zhang L et al.Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 269-271Google Scholar,  16Rossignol JF Nitazoxanide, a new drug candidate for the treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect Public Health. 2016; 9: 227-230Google Scholar,  17Beigel JH Nam HH Adams PL et al.Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics - a meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference.Antiviral Res. 2019; 167: 45-67Google Scholar,  18Sheahan TP Sims AC Leist SR et al.Comparative therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir and combination lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 222Google Scholar,  19Mair-Jenkins J Saavedra-Campos M Baillie JK et al.The effectiveness of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis.J Infect Dis. 2015; 211: 80-90Google Scholar,  20Cunningham AC Goh HP Koh D Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges.Crit Care. 2020; 24: 91Google Scholar,  21Dong L Hu S Gao J Discovering drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Drug Discov Ther. 2020; 14: 58-60Google Scholar These drugs have known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, side-effects, and dosing regimens. As expected, lopinavir–ritonavir alone was shown to have similar effects to placebo on reducing viral load when treatment was initiated at a median of 13 days after symptom onset, despite some improvement in symptoms.22Cao B Wang Y Wen D et al.A trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online March 18.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2001282Google Scholar Up to now, only two open-label non-randomised trials have been reported. One trial used a combination of oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 20 patients with COVID-19 showing that this combination might reduce viral load significantly by day 6 after treatment, compared with 16 controls from another hospital, which could be due to chance because this combination was not planned a priori and the addition of azithromycin was at the physician's discretion.23Gautret P Lagier JC Parola P et al.Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 20.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949Google Scholar A small retrospective analysis showed that viral load was negative at day 7 post-treatment in 75% of patients with COVID-19 treated with arbidol and lopinavir–ritonavir (16 patients) versus 35% of patients treated with lopinavir–ritonavir alone (17 patients).24Deng L Li C Zeng Q et al.Arbidol combined with LPV/r versus LPV/r alone against Corona Virus Disease 2019: a retrospective cohort study.J Infect. 2020;  (published March 11.)DOI:10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002Google Scholar Under the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region public health ordinance, all patients with COVID-19 must stay in hospital until nasopharyngeal swab viral loads are negative on 2 consecutive days. Thus, most patients were admitted to hospital within 7 days of symptom onset, allowing recruitment into the clinical trial during the early course of COVID-19. With the memory of the 2003 SARS pandemic, most patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong accepted antiviral treatment, which explained our high recruitment rate. Despite being an open-label study, all patients were enrolled consecutively without bias. Our case demographics and proportion of patients with underlying diseases were similar to other reported cohorts in China. The low crude mortality rate in Hong Kong (four [0·4%] of 1041 cases) could be explained by the highly vigilant infection control measures, efficient contact tracing, and early hospital admission and treatment. Early treatment with a triple combination of modestly active antivirals is appropriate for the treatment of COVID-19 because the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks at around the time of symptom onset. This is unlike the situation of SARS and MERS when the antiviral treatment has time to suppress the viral load before it peaks at around days 7–10 after symptom onset. The viral load profile of COVID-19 is similar to that of influenza, which has a high viral load at the time of initiation of anti-influenza treatment. The emergence of resistant influenza virus quasispecies during treatment has been well reported with single-drug treatment by amantadine, baloxavir marboxil, and oseltamivir in the setting of severe influenza or diseases caused by H5N1, H7N9, or in immunosuppressed hosts.11Dunning J Baillie JK Cao B Hayden FG Antiviral combinations for severe influenza.Lancet Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 1259-1270Google Scholar,  17Beigel JH Nam HH Adams PL et al.Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics - a meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference.Antiviral Res. 2019; 167: 45-67Google Scholar,  25Hayden FG Sugaya N Hirotsu N et al.Baloxavir marboxil for uncomplicated influenza in adults and adolescents.N Engl J Med. 2018; 379: 913-923Google Scholar Thus, the antiviral combination was considered a reasonable option to improve the outcome of severe influenza. Indeed, we have previously shown that a combination of naproxen and clarithromycin, with weak anti-influenza virus activity in vitro individually, when combined with oseltamivir can improve the morbidity and mortality and shorten the duration of hospital stay in patients with influenza A/H3N2 pneumonia.12Hung IFN To KKW Chan JFW et al.Efficacy of clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination in the treatment of patients hospitalized for influenza A(H3N2) infection: an open-label randomized, controlled, phase IIb/III trial.Chest. 2017; 151: 1069-1080Google Scholar Furthermore, we have previously shown that a combination of lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin significantly reduced mortality and respiratory failure in patients during the 2003 SARS outbreak.7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar Thus, we hypothesised that a triple combination of modest antiviral drugs might rapidly suppress the high initial viral load, improve the clinical parameters, and reduce risk of health-care workers by reducing the duration and quantity of virus shedding from these treated patients. An in-vitro study in cell culture-based assays showed that the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of lopinavir against SARS-CoV is about 17 μM and against MERS-CoV it is about 8 μM, whereas the peak serum lopinavir concentration is about 15 μM with a half-life of 7·4–10·8 h after an oral dose of 400 mg lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir.26de Wilde AH Jochmans D Posthuma CC et al.Screening of an FDA-approved compound library identifies four small-molecule inhibitors of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication in cell culture.Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 4875-4884Google Scholar The EC50 of interferon beta-1b is 0·12 IU/mL against SARS-CoV and 17·6 IU/mL against MERS-CoV,6Chan JF Chan KH Kao RY et al.Broad-spectrum antivirals for the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect. 2013; 67: 606-616Google Scholar,  27Tan EL Ooi EE Lin CY et al.Inhibition of SARS coronavirus infection in vitro with clinically approved antiviral drugs.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 581-586Google Scholar whereas its peak serum level is about 20 IU/mL with a half-life of 2–5 h after a single subcutaneous dose of 8 million IU. Notably, the maintenance of high serum interferon beta-1b level is not essential once the antiviral status of exposed cells is induced. The EC50 of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 was 109 μM,15Wang M Cao R Zhang L et al.Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 269-271Google Scholar which greatly exceeds the drug's serum concentration with the usual oral dosing. Nevertheless, synergistic activity between interferons and a lower dose of ribavirin have been shown in checkerboard assays. However, combining ribavirin with interferons (alfa-2a, alfa-2b, and beta-1a) did not improve outcomes in critically ill patients with MERS.28Arabi YM Shalhoub S Mandourah Y et al.Ribavirin and interferon therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: a multicentre observational study.Clin Infect Dis. 2020; 70: 1837-1844Google Scholar Thus, the repurposing of this triple combination of modestly active lopinavir–ritonavir, interferon beta-1b, and ribavirin for the treatment of this novel pandemic virus should be a reasonable therapeutic approach. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in ex-vivo infected human lung tissues compared with 2003 SARS-CoV.29Chu H Chan JF-W Wang Y et al.Comparative replication and immune activation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in human lungs: an ex vivo study with implications for the pathogenesis of COVID-19.Clin Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1093/cid/ciaa410Google Scholar Thus, the use of interferon beta-1b treatment to jump-start or improve the antiviral response of patients would be a logical approach. Additionally, interferon beta-1b was shown to decrease virus-induced lung fibrosis in a mouse model, which might improve outcomes of patients with COVID-19 complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome.30Luckhardt TR Commes SM Trujillo G et al.TLR9-induced interferon β is associated with protection from gammaherpesvirus-induced exacerbation of lung fibrosis.Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair. 2011; 4: 18Google Scholar Despite the concern of major side-effects arising from a combination of three drugs, no significant differences in incidence of adverse events between treatment groups were reported in our cohort of 127 patients. No haemolysis occurred from the short duration of low dose ribavirin. We did not use triple combination for patients who started treatment 7 days or more after symptom onset because of the concerns about the proinflammatory side-effects of interferon beta-1b, despite that at most three doses were used for each patient. Liver dysfunction was observed in about 14% of these patients and it was mild and self-limiting, except in one patient in the control group, in whom the biochemical hepatitis warranted the discontinuation of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment. Our study had several limitations. This trial was open label, without a placebo group, and confounded by a subgroup omitting interferon beta-1b within the combination group, depending on time from symptom onset. A subsequent phase 3 trial with interferon beta-1b as a backbone treatment with a placebo control group should be considered, because subgroup comparison suggested that interferon beta-1b appears to be a key component of our combination treatment. Our absence of critically ill patients did not allow the generalisation of our findings to severe cases. Triple antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin were safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in shortening virus shedding, alleviating symptoms, and facilitating discharge of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

He was born in Rio Pardo, Brazil, on Jan 30, 1940, and died in Washington, DC, USA, on May 28, 2014, aged 74 years. The last case of polio in Latin America was detected in 1991 in the small Peruvian town of Pichanaki. 3 years later, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) declared the disease eradicated within its region. If one man can be said to deserve personal credit for this achievement, it is Ciro de Quadros. A physician trained in public health, he joined PAHO in 1977 to advise on matters related to immunisation, and to implement the Expanded Programme on Immunization in Latin America. “At that time vaccine coverage rates were only 5 to 20%”, says Donald Henderson, Professor of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh. “What Ciro did was amazing.” He persuaded countries to join what became a hemisphere-wide effort. “Within 5 or 6 years all except Haiti had well over 80% coverage.” de Quadros also created a fund for buying vaccines on behalf of PAHO members, one of the largest ever bulk purchasing schemes in the public sector. Countries were able to buy vaccines in quantities that would otherwise have been unaffordable. It was in 1985 that de Quadros put forward his programme for eliminating polio from the Americas, an ambition that Henderson admits to having viewed with scepticism. But he succeeded—and then managed something similar for indigenous measles. Henderson attributes de Quadros's success to the way he did his job. “He travelled extensively, he talked with staff, he talked with ministers. He persuaded them that it was their programme. He could help, yes—but it was their programme.” de Quadros trained at the Catholic School of Medicine in Porto Alegre, did a master's degree in public health, and in 1967 joined the Brazilian public health service working at a health centre in the Amazon region. He became involved in the smallpox campaign and, with three colleagues, began testing the value of a surveillance and containment strategy as an alternative to the proven but unaffordable policy of mass vaccination. Over the next 8 months they identified more than 100 cases of smallpox, vaccinated all their contacts, and succeeded in breaking the chain of transmission. On the strength of this achievement de Quadros became the chief epidemiologist to WHO's smallpox eradication programme in Ethiopia. “He took on smallpox in the field with something like ten Ethiopian health officers and a dozen or so US Peace Corps people”, recalls Henderson. “Ethiopia's a big place and the roads were terrible. He was working under very difficult conditions, but within 12 months they'd turned up 600 cases.” Among those Peace Corps volunteers was Peter Carrasco, now Director of the Secretariat of the International Association of Immunization Managers based at the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, DC. Two previous Peace Corps groups had dealt with all locations that were accessible by road. “When Ciro and I hooked up we were looking at the hardest parts of Ethiopia to get to”, Carrasco recalls. There was no way they could do the job on foot, so they started to use helicopters in the highlands and camels in the desert areas. It was after the success of the Ethiopian smallpox project that de Quadros joined PAHO to head up the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Between 1994 and 1998 he spent 4 years as special adviser on vaccines to the Director-General of WHO, but continued to work for PAHO until his retirement in 2002. Even then, he maintained his lifelong connection with vaccination through his appointment as a Vice-President of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington. Throughout de Quadros's life, Henderson thinks, if he was told something couldn't be done, he wanted to do it. And usually he succeeded. “His work was a marvellous illustration of community involvement in accomplishing a task”, says Henderson. “He understood management”, adds Carrasco. He used his smallpox experience in building the Expanded Programme on Immunization and ridding Latin America of polio. “He showed the doubters, and there were many of them, that polio could be eradicated. He was very practical and had very clear insights”, says Carrasco. Despite de Quadros's many awards and the medals, “he was very down to earth”, notes Carrasco. “He was the kind of man who could sit down with an ordinary health worker, have a beer with him, and motivate that guy to do a better job.” de Quadros is survived by a wife, two daughters, and two stepsons.","July 19, 2014",Closed

Patient 1 was a male renal transplant recipient, aged 71 years, with coronary artery disease and arterial hypertension. The patient's condition deteriorated following COVID-19 diagnosis, and he required mechanical ventilation. Multisystem organ failure occurred, and the patient died on day 8. Post-mortem analysis of the transplanted kidney by electron microscopy revealed viral inclusion structures in endothelial cells (figure A, B). In histological analyses, we found an accumulation of inflammatory cells associated with endothelium, as well as apoptotic bodies, in the heart, the small bowel (figure C) and lung (figure D). An accumulation of mononuclear cells was found in the lung, and most small lung vessels appeared congested.FigurePathology of endothelial cell dysfunction in COVID-19Show full caption(A, B) Electron microscopy of kidney tissue shows viral inclusion bodies in a peritubular space and viral particles in endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary loops.

COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. Patient 2 was a woman, aged 58 years, with diabetes, arterial hypertension, and obesity. She developed progressive respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and subsequently developed multi-organ failure and needed renal replacement therapy. On day 16, mesenteric ischaemia prompted removal of necrotic small intestine. Circulatory failure occurred in the setting of right heart failure consequent to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest resulted in death. Post-mortem histology revealed lymphocytic endotheliitis in lung, heart, kidney, and liver as well as liver cell necrosis. We found histological evidence of myocardial infarction but no sign of lymphocytic myocarditis. Histology of the small intestine showed endotheliitis (endothelialitis) of the submucosal vessels. Patient 3 was a man, aged 69 years, with hypertension who developed respiratory failure as a result of COVID-19 and required mechanical ventilation. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Circulatory collapse ensued with mesenteric ischaemia, and small intestine resection was performed, but the patient survived. Histology of the small intestine resection revealed prominent endotheliitis of the submucosal vessels and apoptotic bodies (figure C). We found evidence of direct viral infection of the endothelial cell and diffuse endothelial inflammation. Although the virus uses ACE2 receptor expressed by pneumocytes in the epithelial alveolar lining to infect the host, thereby causing lung injury, the ACE2 receptor is also widely expressed on endothelial cells, which traverse multiple organs.3Ferrario CM Jessup J Chappell MC et al.Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockers on cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.Circulation. 2005; 111: 2605-2610Google Scholar Recruitment of immune cells, either by direct viral infection of the endothelium or immune-mediated, can result in widespread endothelial dysfunction associated with apoptosis (figure D). The vascular endothelium is an active paracrine, endocrine, and autocrine organ that is indispensable for the regulation of vascular tone and the maintenance of vascular homoeostasis.5Flammer AJ Anderson T Celermajer DS et al.The assessment of endothelial function: from research into clinical practice.Circulation. 2012; 126: 753-767Google Scholar Endothelial dysfunction is a principal determinant of microvascular dysfunction by shifting the vascular equilibrium towards more vasoconstriction with subsequent organ ischaemia, inflammation with associated tissue oedema, and a pro-coagulant state.6Bonetti PO Lerman LO Lerman A Endothelial dysfunction - a marker of atherosclerotic risk.Arterioscl Throm Vas. 2003; 23: 168-175Google Scholar Our findings show the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and an accumulation of inflammatory cells, with evidence of endothelial and inflammatory cell death. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates the induction of endotheliitis in several organs as a direct consequence of viral involvement (as noted with presence of viral bodies) and of the host inflammatory response. In addition, induction of apoptosis and pyroptosis might have an important role in endothelial cell injury in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-endotheliitis could explain the systemic impaired microcirculatory function in different vascular beds and their clinical sequelae in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis provides a rationale for therapies to stabilise the endothelium while tackling viral replication, particularly with anti-inflammatory anti-cytokine drugs, ACE inhibitors, and statins.7Anderson TJ Meredith IT Yeung AC Frei B Selwyn AP Ganz P The effect of cholesterol-lowering and antioxidant therapy on endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion.N Engl J Med. 1995; 332: 488-493Google Scholar,  8Taddei S Virdis A Ghiadoni L Mattei P Salvetti A Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in essential hypertensive patients.J Hypertens. 1998; 16: 447-456Google Scholar,  9Flammer AJ Sudano I Hermann F et al.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves vascular function in rheumatoid arthritis.Circulation. 2008; 117: 2262-2269Google Scholar,  10Hurlimann D Forster A Noll G et al.Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment improves endothelial function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Circulation. 2002; 106: 2184-2187Google Scholar,  11Feldmann M Maini RN Woody JN et al.Trials of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy for COVID-19 are urgently needed.Lancet. 2020;  (published online April 9.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30858-8SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFGoogle Scholar This strategy could be particularly relevant for vulnerable patients with pre-existing endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and established cardiovascular disease, all of which are associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19.

Sophie Cousins reports. New Zealand recorded its first day of no new cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early this week, more than a month after its strict lockdown began. At the time of publication, New Zealand had recorded fewer than 1500 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 20 deaths. On March 23, a month after the country had recorded its first case, New Zealand committed to an elimination strategy. A few days later, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a strict national lockdown when it only had 102 cases and zero deaths. Her swift decision making won international praise, including from WHO. New Zealand's decision to pursue an elimination approach was a vastly different approach to usual pandemic planning, which has historically been based on a mitigation model and focuses on delaying the arrival of the virus, followed by a range of measures to flatten the curve of cases and deaths. Michael Baker, professor at the University of Otago's department of public health in Wellington, who has been advising the New Zealand Government on its response, said implementing a full lockdown—involving the closure of schools and non-essential workplaces, a ban on social gatherings, and severe travel restrictions—enabled the country to consider elimination. “I think it was the right decision; we had to go hard”, he said. “The two biggest benefits of pursuing an elimination strategy is that you have few cases and few deaths and you can get business back up and running. The alternative was that we are stuck with the virus and stuck between mitigation and suppression. Suppression is pretty grim.” While the strategy has had its critics, for Baker, the evidence was overwhelming that elimination could be achieved. Baker said the full lockdown allowed the country to get key systems up and running to effectively manage borders, and do contact tracing, testing, and surveillance. Since Jan 22, more than 150 000 people have been tested in a country of just 5 million. Testing has been focused on people with symptoms, with tracing of both close contacts and casual contacts. However, more widespread testing is now being introduced. The Ministry of Health is in discussion with districts to arrange testing of specific communities who are at higher risk of acquiring the virus such as those in aged residential care and health-care workers. Testing samples from sewerage is also being considered to monitor control and elimination. The response has also been one that placed science, leadership, and careful language at the forefront. Siouxsie Wiles, associate professor and head of the Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab at the University of Auckland, said one of the country's key successes has been the way in which COVID-19 was framed to the general population. “In other countries, people have been talking about war and battle, which puts people in a negative and fearful frame of mind”, she said. “The official response here has been guided by the principle that you do not stigmatise and that we unite against COVID-19.” Ardern has regularly appeared on social media, smiling and sharing parts of her personal life under lockdown but without underplaying the seriousness of the situation, which has helped to build public trust. Baker agreed that language was a crucial part of the response. He said that how the country communicates the concept of elimination will be important going forwards. Wiles agreed. “We don't want the public to feel like they are being lied to. Elimination to everyone means that it is gone. But in epidemiological terms, it means bringing cases down to zero or near zero in a geographical location. We will still see cases…but only cases in people who have arrived from overseas.” Travellers from abroad will be quarantined as part of efforts to prevent transmission in New Zealand. As New Zealand now eases its restrictions and its economy slowly reopens, there are discussions about how it can open up its borders while ensuring that everyone is protected, particularly susceptible populations. Australia, which is having similar success to New Zealand but is not publicly floating the idea of elimination, has been in discussion with its neighbour about reopening travel between the two countries. Baker envisions that, in time, a small number of countries in the region will reach an agreement to enable travel with specific control measures in place. Officials have pleaded for vigilance as breaches of the shutdown rules continue to rise. When the country loosened some of its restrictions last week, some fast-food outlets ran out of food as people flocked in huge numbers to get burgers and fries. “We are nearly there. We are not at the finish line yet”, Wiles said. “We won't see how successful we have been for a few weeks yet.”","May 09, 2020",Closed

Clinical presentations were similar, with unrelenting fever (38–40°C), variable rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral oedema, and generalised extremity pain with significant gastrointestinal symptoms. All progressed to warm, vasoplegic shock, refractory to volume resuscitation and eventually requiring noradrenaline and milrinone for haemodynamic support. Most of the children had no significant respiratory involvement, although seven of the children required mechanical ventilation for cardiovascular stabilisation. Other notable features (besides persistent fever and rash) included development of small pleural, pericardial, and ascitic effusions, suggestive of a diffuse inflammatory process. All children tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on broncho-alveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal aspirates. Despite being critically unwell, with laboratory evidence of infection or inflammation3Li Y Zou L Wu J et al.Kawasaki disease shock syndrome: clinical characteristics and possible use of IL-6, IL-10 and IFN- as biomarkers for early recognition.Pediatr Rheumatol Online J. 2019; 17: 1CrossrefPubMedScopus (2)Google Scholar including elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, triglycerides, and D-dimers, no pathological organism was identified in seven of the children. Adenovirus and enterovirus were isolated in one child. Baseline electrocardiograms were non-specific; however, a common echocardiographic finding was echo-bright coronary vessels (appendix), which progressed to giant coronary aneurysm in one patient within a week of discharge from paediatric intensive care (appendix). One child developed arrhythmia with refractory shock, requiring extracorporeal life support, and died from a large cerebrovascular infarct. The myocardial involvement2Liu P Blet A Smyth D Li H The science underlying COVID-19: implications for the cardiovascular system.Circulation. 2020;  (published online April 15.)DOI:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047549CrossrefGoogle Scholar in this syndrome is evidenced by very elevated cardiac enzymes during the course of illness. All children were given intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) in the first 24 h, and antibiotic cover including ceftriaxone and clindamycin. Subsequently, six children have been given 50 mg/kg aspirin. All of the children were discharged from PICU after 4–6 days. Since discharge, two of the children have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (including the child who died, in whom SARS-CoV-2 was detected post mortem). All children are receiving ongoing surveillance for coronary abnormalities. We suggest that this clinical picture represents a new phenomenon affecting previously asymptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection manifesting as a hyperinflammatory syndrome with multiorgan involvement similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome. The multifaceted nature of the disease course underlines the need for multispecialty input (intensive care, cardiology, infectious diseases, immunology, and rheumatology). The intention of this Correspondence is to bring this subset of children to the attention of the wider paediatric community and to optimise early recognition and management. As this Correspondence goes to press, 1 week after the initial submission, the Evelina London Children's Hospital paediatric intensive care unit has managed more than 20 children with similar clinical presentation, the first ten of whom tested positive for antibody (including the original eight children in the cohort described above).

Severe critics have described it as Sweden sacrificing its (elderly) citizens to quickly reach herd immunity.1Henley J Swedish PM warned over ‘Russian roulette-style’ Covid-19 strategy.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/swedish-pm-warned-russian-roulette-covid-19-strategy-herd-immunityDate: March 23, 2020Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar The death toll has surpassed our three closest neighbours, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, but the mortality remains lower than in the UK, Spain, and Belgium.2European Centre for Disease Prevention and Controlhttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-casesDate: May 1, 2020Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar It has become clear that a hard lockdown does not protect old and frail people living in care homes—a population the lockdown was designed to protect.3BBCCoronavirus: Hard to prevent care home deaths, says Chris Whitty.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52386808Date: April 22, 2020Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar Neither does it decrease mortality from COVID-19, which is evident when comparing the UK's experience with that of other European countries. PCR testing and some straightforward assumptions indicate that, as of April 29, 2020, more than half a million people in Stockholm county, Sweden, which is about 20–25% of the population, have been infected (Hansson D, Swedish Public Health Agency, personal communication). 98–99% of these people are probably unaware or uncertain of having had the infection; they either had symptoms that were severe, but not severe enough for them to go to a hospital and get tested, or no symptoms at all. Serology testing is now supporting these assumptions.4Hedberg K Var femte anställd på Danderyds sjukhus har haft smittan.https://www.dn.se/sthlm/var-femte-anstalld-pa-danderyds-sjukhus-har-haft-smittan/Date: April 27, 2020Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar These facts have led me to the following conclusions. Everyone will be exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and most people will become infected. COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire in all countries, but we do not see it—it almost always spreads from younger people with no or weak symptoms to other people who will also have mild symptoms. This is the real pandemic, but it goes on beneath the surface, and is probably at its peak now in many European countries. There is very little we can do to prevent this spread: a lockdown might delay severe cases for a while, but once restrictions are eased, cases will reappear. I expect that when we count the number of deaths from COVID-19 in each country in 1 year from now, the figures will be similar, regardless of measures taken. Measures to flatten the curve might have an effect, but a lockdown only pushes the severe cases into the future —it will not prevent them. Admittedly, countries have managed to slow down spread so as not to overburden health-care systems, and, yes, effective drugs that save lives might soon be developed, but this pandemic is swift, and those drugs have to be developed, tested, and marketed quickly. Much hope is put in vaccines, but they will take time, and with the unclear protective immunological response to infection, it is not certain that vaccines will be very effective. In summary, COVID-19 is a disease that is highly infectious and spreads rapidly through society. It is often quite symptomless and might pass unnoticed, but it also causes severe disease, and even death, in a proportion of the population, and our most important task is not to stop spread, which is all but futile, but to concentrate on giving the unfortunate victims optimal care. I declare no competing interests.","May 05, 2020",Closed

There was mixed evidence for whether participant characteristics and demographics were predictors of the psychological impact of quarantine.

However, another study16Hawryluck L Gold WL Robinson S Pogorski S Galea S Styra R SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 1206-1212CrossrefPubMedScopus (93)Google Scholar suggested that demographic factors such as marital status, age, education, living with other adults, and having children were not associated with psychological outcomes. Having a history of psychiatric illness was associated with experiencing anxiety and anger 4–6 months after release from quarantine.17Jeong H Yim HW Song Y-J et al.Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East respiratory syndrome.Epidemiol Health. 2016; 38: e2016048CrossrefPubMedScopus (12)Google Scholar Health-care workers25Reynolds DL Garay JR Deamond SL Moran MK Gold W Styra R Understanding, compliance and psychological impact of the SARS quarantine experience.Epidemiol Infect. 2008; 136: 997-1007CrossrefPubMedScopus (18)Google Scholar who had been quarantined had more severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress than members of the general public who had been quarantined, scoring significantly higher on all dimensions. Health-care workers also felt greater stigmatisation than the general public, exhibited more avoidance behaviours after quarantine, reported greater lost income, and were consistently more affected psychologically: they reported substantially more anger, annoyance, fear, frustration, guilt, helplessness, isolation, loneliness, nervousness, sadness, worry, and were less happy. Health-care workers were also substantially more likely to think they had SARS and to be concerned about infecting others.

This finding is probably linked to economic effects but could also be related to disruption of social networks and loss of leisure activities. Notably, this study is exceptional in that occupation and exposure are confounded. A study14Desclaux A Badji D Ndione AG Sow K Accepted monitoring or endured quarantine? Ebola contacts' perceptions in Senegal.Soc Sci Med. 2017; 178: 38-45CrossrefPubMedScopus (5)Google Scholar of people quarantined because of potential Ebola contact found that, although participants received financial assistance, some felt that the amount was insufficient and that it came too late; many felt wronged as the assistance they received did not cover their ongoing professional expenses. Many became dependent on their families to provide for them financially during quarantine which was often hard to accept and could cause conflicts. In one study,13Cava MA Fay KE Beanlands HJ McCay EA Wignall R The experience of quarantine for individuals affected by SARS in Toronto.Public Health Nurs. 2005; 22: 398-406CrossrefPubMedScopus (18)Google Scholar none of those quarantined in Toronto during SARS reported much financial hardship because employers or the government compensated them, but where that reimbursement was slow to arrive it caused those less financially well-off to struggle. Potentially related to financial loss, participants with a combined annual household income of less than CAN$40 000 showed significantly higher amounts of post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms.16Hawryluck L Gold WL Robinson S Pogorski S Galea S Styra R SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 1206-1212CrossrefPubMedScopus (93)Google Scholar These symptoms are probably because those with lower incomes were more likely to be affected by the temporary loss of income than those with higher incomes. People who are quarantined and have lower household incomes might require additional levels of support, along with those who lose earnings while in quarantine (ie, self-employed people who are unable to work or salaried staff who are unable to take paid leave). Financial reimbursements should be provided where possible and programmes developed to provide financial support throughout the quarantine period. Where appropriate, employers might also wish to consider proactive approaches that allow employees to work from home if they wish to, both to avoid financial loss and to stave off boredom, while being mindful that staff in these situations might not be at their most productive and might benefit more from remote social support from their colleagues.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Stigma from others was a major theme throughout the literature, often continuing for some time after quarantine, even after containment of the outbreak.

Ebola contacts' perceptions in Senegal.Soc Sci Med. 2017; 178: 38-45CrossrefPubMedScopus (5)Google Scholar In the same study, three participants reported being unable to resume their jobs after surveillance ended because their employers expressed fear of contagion. Those quarantined during the Ebola epidemic in Liberia reported that stigma could lead to disenfranchisement of minority groups in the community as families under quarantine were often said to belong to different ethnic groups, tribes, or religions and were perceived as dangerous because they were different.24Pellecchia U Crestani R Decroo T Van den Bergh R Al-Kourdi Y Social consequences of Ebola containment measures in Liberia.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0143036CrossrefPubMedScopus (23)Google Scholar Perhaps because of this stigma, being quarantined led participants in this study to keep easily treatable, non-Ebola illnesses a secret and avoided seeking help. General education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can be beneficial to reduce stigmatisation, whereas more detailed information targeted at schools and workplaces might also be useful. It might also be that media reporting contributes to stigmatising attitudes in the general public; the media is a powerful influence on public attitudes and dramatic headlines and fear mongering have been shown to contribute to stigmatising attitudes in the past (eg, during the SARS outbreak).36Person B Sy F Holton K et al.Fear and stigma: the epidemic within the SARS outbreak.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 358-363CrossrefPubMedScopus (70)Google Scholar This issue highlights the need for public health officials to provide rapid, clear messages delivered effectively for the entire affected population to promote accurate understanding of the situation. During major infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be a necessary preventive measure. However, this Review suggests that quarantine is often associated with a negative psychological effect. During the period of quarantine this negative psychological effect is unsurprising, yet the evidence that a psychological effect of quarantine can still be detected months or years later—albeit from a small number of studies17Jeong H Yim HW Song Y-J et al.Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East respiratory syndrome.Epidemiol Health. 2016; 38: e2016048CrossrefPubMedScopus (12)Google Scholar,  19Liu X Kakade M Fuller CJ et al.Depression after exposure to stressful events: lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic.Compr Psychiatry. 2012; 53: 15-23CrossrefPubMedScopus (6)Google Scholar— is more troubling and suggests the need to ensure that effective mitigation measures are put in place as part of the quarantine planning process. In this regard, our results do not provide strong evidence that any particular demographic factors are risk factors of poor psychological outcomes after quarantine and therefore require specific attention. However, history of mental illness was only examined as a risk factor by one study. Previous literature suggests that psychiatric history is associated with psychological distress after experiencing any disaster-related trauma37Alvarez J Hunt M Risk and resilience in canine search and rescue handlers after 9/11.J Trauma Stress. 2005; 18: 497-505CrossrefPubMedScopus (40)Google Scholar,  38Cukor J Wyka K Jayasinghe N et al.Prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms in utility workers deployed to the World Trade Center following the attacks of September 11, 2001.Depress Anxiety. 2011; 28: 210-217CrossrefPubMedScopus (34)Google Scholar and it is likely that people with pre-existing poor mental health would need extra support during quarantine. There also appeared to be a high prevalence of psychological distress in quarantined health-care workers, although there was mixed evidence as to whether this group were at higher risk for distress than non-health-care workers who were quarantined. For health-care workers, support from managers is essential in facilitating their return to work39Brooks SK Dunn R Amlôt R Rubin GJ Greenberg N A systematic, thematic review of social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in healthcare employees during an infectious disease outbreak.J Occup Environ Med. 2018; 60: 248-257CrossrefPubMedScopus (3)Google Scholar and managers should be aware of the potential risks for their staff who were quarantined so that they can prepare for early intervention. Longer quarantine is associated with poorer psychological outcomes, perhaps unsurprisingly, as it stands to reason that the stressors reported by participants could have more of an effect the longer they were experienced for. Restricting the length of quarantine to what is scientifically reasonable given the known duration of incubation periods, and not adopting an overly precautionary approach to this, would minimise the effect on people. Evidence from elsewhere also emphasises the importance of authorities adhering to their own recommended length of quarantine, and not extending it. For people already in quarantine, an extension, no matter how small, is likely to exacerbate any sense of frustration or demoralisation.40Rona RJ Fear NT Hull L et al.Mental health consequences of overstretch in the UK armed forces: first phase of a cohort study.BMJ. 2007; 335: 603CrossrefPubMedScopus (100)Google Scholar Imposing a cordon indefinitely on whole cities with no clear time limit (such as has been seen in Wuhan, China) might be more detrimental than strictly applied quarantine procedures limited to the period of incubation. People who are quarantined often feared being infected or infecting others. They also often have catastrophic appraisals of any physical symptoms experienced during the quarantine period. This fear is a common occurrence for people exposed to a worrying infectious disease,41Rubin GJ Harper S Williams PD et al.How to support staff deploying on overseas humanitarian work: a qualitative analysis of responder views about the 2014/15 West African Ebola outbreak.Eur J Psychotraumatol. 2016; 7: 30933CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar and might be exacerbated by the often inadequate information participants reported receiving from public health officials leaving them unclear of the nature of the risks they faced and why they were being quarantined at all. Ensuring that those under quarantine have a good understanding of the disease in question, and the reasons for quarantine, should be a priority. Officials also need to ensure that quarantined households have enough supplies for their basic needs and, importantly, these must be provided as rapidly as possible. Coordination for provision of supplies should ideally occur in advance, with conservation and reallocation plans established to ensure resources do not run out, which unfortunately has been reported.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Boredom and isolation will cause distress; people who are quarantined should be advised about what they can do to stave off boredom and provided with practical advice on coping and stress management techniques. Having a working mobile phone is now a necessity, not a luxury, and those stepping off a long flight to enter quarantine will probably welcome a charger or adaptor more than anything else.17Jeong H Yim HW Song Y-J et al.Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East respiratory syndrome.Epidemiol Health. 2016; 38: e2016048CrossrefPubMedScopus (12)Google Scholar Activating your social network, albeit remotely, is not just a key priority, but an inability to do so is associated not just with immediate anxiety, but longer- term distress.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar,  42Rubin GJ Brewin CR Greenberg N Simpson J Wessely S Psychological and behavioural reactions to the bombings in London on 7 July 2005: cross sectional survey of a representative sample of Londoners.BMJ. 2005; 331: 606CrossrefPubMedScopus (154)Google Scholar One study21Maunder R Hunter J Vincent L et al.The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital.CMAJ. 2003; 168: 1245-1251PubMedGoogle Scholar suggested that having a telephone support line, staffed by psychiatric nurses, set up specifically for those in quarantine could be effective in terms of providing them with a social network. The ability to communicate with one's family and friends is also essential. Particularly, social media could play an important part in communication with those far away, allowing people who are quarantined to update their loved ones about their situation and reassure them that they are well. Therefore, providing those quarantined with mobile phones, cords and outlets for charging devices, and robust WiFi networks with internet access to allow them to communicate directly with loved ones could reduce feelings of isolation, stress, and panic.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Although this is possible to achieve in enforced quarantine, it could be more difficult to do in the case of widespread home quarantine; countries imposing censors on social media and messaging applications could also present difficulties in ensuring lines of communication between those quarantined and their loved ones. It is also important that public health officials maintain clear lines of communication with people quarantined about what to do if they experience any symptoms. A phone line or online service specifically set up for those in quarantine and staffed by health-care workers who can provide instructions about what to do in the event of developing illness symptoms, would help reassure people that they will be cared for if they become ill. This service would show those who are quarantined that they have not been forgotten and that their health needs are just as important as those of the wider public. The benefits of such a resource have not been studied, but it is likely that reassurance could subsequently decrease feelings such as fear, worry, and anger. There is evidence to suggest that support groups specifically for people who were quarantined at home during disease outbreaks can be helpful. One study23Pan PJD Chang S-H Yu Y-Y A support group for home-quarantined college students exposed to SARS: learning from practice.J Spec Group Work. 2005; 30: 363-374CrossrefScopus (4)Google Scholar found that having such a group and feeling connected to others who had been through the same situation could be a validating, empowering experience and can provide people with the support they might find they are not receiving from other people. Health-care workers themselves are often quarantined and this Review suggests they, like the general public, are negatively affected by stigmatising attitudes from others. None of the studies included in this Review focused on the perceptions of their colleagues, but this would be an interesting aspect to explore. It is also possible that health-care workers who are quarantined might be concerned about causing their workplaces to be understaffed and causing extra work for their colleagues21Maunder R Hunter J Vincent L et al.The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital.CMAJ. 2003; 168: 1245-1251PubMedGoogle Scholar and that their colleagues' perceptions could be particularly important. Being separated from a team they are used to working in close contact with might add to feelings of isolation for health-care workers who are quarantined. Therefore, it is essential that they feel supported by their immediate colleagues. During infectious disease outbreaks, organisational support has been found to be protective of mental health for health-care staff in general39Brooks SK Dunn R Amlôt R Rubin GJ Greenberg N A systematic, thematic review of social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in healthcare employees during an infectious disease outbreak.J Occup Environ Med. 2018; 60: 248-257CrossrefPubMedScopus (3)Google Scholar and managers should take steps to ensure their staff members are supportive of their colleagues who are quarantined. Perhaps because of the difficulties of designing an appropriate study, no research was found which tested whether mandatory versus voluntary quarantine has a differential effect on wellbeing. In other contexts, however, feeling that others will benefit from one's situation can make stressful situations easier to bear and it seems likely that this is also true for home-based quarantine. Reinforcing that quarantine is helping to keep others safe, including those particularly vulnerable (such as those who are very young, old, or with pre-existing serious medical conditions), and that health authorities are genuinely grateful to them, can only help to reduce the mental health effect and adherence in those quarantined.19Liu X Kakade M Fuller CJ et al.Depression after exposure to stressful events: lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic.Compr Psychiatry. 2012; 53: 15-23CrossrefPubMedScopus (6)Google Scholar,  33Wu P Fang Y Guan Z et al.The psychological impact of the SARS epidemic on hospital employees in China: exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk.Can J Psychiatry. 2009; 54: 302-311CrossrefPubMedScopus (33)Google Scholar Notably, altruism has its limits if people are being asked to quarantine without adequate information on how to keep the people they live with safe. It is unacceptable to ask people to self-quarantine for the benefit of the community's health, when while doing so they might be putting their loved ones at risk. Quarantine is one of several public health measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and as shown in this Review, has a considerable psychological impact for those affected. As such, there is a question as to whether other public health measures that prevent the need to impose quarantine (such as social distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, and school closures) might be more favourable. Future research is needed to establish the effectiveness of such measures. The strengths and limitations of this Review must be considered. Because of the time constraints of this Review given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the reviewed literature did not undergo formal quality appraisal. Additionally, the Review was limited to peer-reviewed publications and we did not explore potentially relevant grey literature. The recommendations we have made apply primarily to small groups of people in dedicated facilities and to some extent in self-isolation. Although we anticipate that many of the risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes would be the same for larger containment processes (such as entire towns or cities), there are likely to be distinct differences in such situations that mean that the information presented in this Review should only be applied to such situations cautiously. Furthermore, potential cultural differences need to be considered. Although this Review cannot predict exactly what will happen or provide recommendations that will work for every future population that is quarantined, we have provided an overview of the key issues and how they could be rectified in the future. There are also several limitations of the reviewed literature, which must be pointed out: only one study followed up participants over time, sample sizes were generally small, few studies directly compared participants quarantined with those not quarantined, conclusions based on certain study populations (eg, students) might not be generalisable to the wider public, and heterogeneity of outcome measures across studies make it difficult to make direct comparisons between studies. It is also worth pointing out that a minority of studies assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress using measures designed to measure post-traumatic stress disorder, despite quarantine not being qualified as a trauma in the diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5.43American Psychiatric AssociationDiagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5.  American Psychiatric Association,        Arlington, VA2013CrossrefGoogle Scholar Strengths of this Review include the hand-searching of reference lists to identify any papers not found in the initial search, contacting authors who sent full-texts of papers which were not available in full online, and having multiple researchers carry out the screening to improve the rigour of the Review. Overall, this Review suggests that the psychological impact of quarantine is wide-ranging, substantial, and can be long lasting. This is not to suggest that quarantine should not be used; the psychological effects of not using quarantine and allowing disease to spread might be worse.44Hull HF SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada.Emerging Infectious Diseases. 2005; 11: 354-355CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar However, depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled carefully. If quarantine is essential, then our results suggest that officials should take every measure to ensure that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people. This can be achieved by: telling people what is happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling. Health officials charged with implementing quarantine, who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security, should also remember that not everyone is in the same situation. If the quarantine experience is negative, the results of this Review suggest there can be long-term consequences that affect not just the people quarantined but also the health-care system that administered the quarantine and the politicians and public health officials who mandated it.

We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain.MethodsWe did a dose-escalation, single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups (5 × 1010, 1 × 1011, and 1·5 × 1011 viral particles) to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine. The primary outcome was adverse events in the 7 days post-vaccination. Safety was assessed over 28 days post-vaccination. Specific antibodies were measured with ELISA, and the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests. T-cell responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry assays. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04313127.FindingsBetween March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 participants (51% male, 49% female; mean age 36·3 years) were recruited and received the low dose (n=36), middle dose (n=36), or high dose (n=36) of the vaccine. All enrolled participants were included in the analysis. At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days after the vaccination was reported in 30 (83%) participants in the low dose group, 30 (83%) participants in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) participants in the high dose group. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. Most adverse reactions that were reported in all dose groups were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was noted within 28 days post-vaccination.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on May 8, 2020, for clinical trial reports with the terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, and “clinical trial” and no date or language restrictions; no other data from a human clinical trial of COVID-19 vaccine have been reported thus far, to our knowledge. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for unpublished trials of COVID-19 vaccines, up to May 6, 2020. In addition to the adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine reported here, seven candidate COVID-19 vaccines are in ongoing clinical trials, including Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Inovio Pharmaceuticals' DNA vaccine, Sinovac, Wuhan and Beijing Institute of Biological Products' inactive COVID-19 vaccines, University of Oxford's chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, and BioNTech's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.Added value of this studyThis first-in-human trial showed that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerable and immunogenic in healthy adults. One dose of the vaccine at all dose concentrations (5 × 1010, 1 × 1011, and 1·5 × 1011 viral particles) tested induced both specific antibody and T-cell responses in most participants. Rapid specific T-cell responses were noted at day 14 and specific humoral responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination. Although we found that the high dose vaccine tended to be more immunogenic than the middle dose and low dose vaccines, it was also associated with a higher reactogenicity. Severe fever, fatigue, dyspnoea, muscle pain, and joint pain were reported in some of the recipients in the high dose group.Implications of all the available evidenceMany vaccine candidates are in rapid development, including recombinant-protein based vaccines, replicating or non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines (which mostly have focused on the spike glycoprotein or receptor binding domain), live attenuated vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines. All of these vaccine platforms have advantages and disadvantages, and it is too soon to predict which will be more successful.

Our study suggests that there is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19. Here, we report the preliminary assessment at 28 days post-vaccination of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CanSino's non-replicating Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults in China. We did a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, dose-escalation phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate in a rehabilitation centre in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Eligible participants were healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years, who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by negative results of serum specific IgM and IgG antibodies with a commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid test kit (Jinwofu, Beijing, China), negative nucleic acid for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs or sputum and anal swabs detected with a nucleic acid diagnostic kit (PCR-fluorescence probing, Sansure Biotech, Changsha, China), and a clear chest CT image with no evidence of lesions in the lungs at the time of screening. Exclusion criteria were a history of seizures or mental illness; allergy to any ingredient included in the vaccine; acute febrile disease on the day of enrolment; receipt of any blood products in the past 4 months; receipt of any research medicines or vaccine in the past month; and being unable to comply with the study schedule. Further details are outlined in the protocol.10Zhu F-C Guan X-H Wang W et al.Protocol. A single-center, open-label, dose-escalating phase I clinical trial of the recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine (adenovirus type 5 vector) in healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years in China.http://www.jscdc.cn/jkfw/kygz/202005/P020200517367817987697.pdfDate: 2020Date accessed: May 20, 2020Google Scholar Participants were sequentially enrolled to receive a single intramuscular injection in a dose-escalating manner: the first group of participants were allocated to receive the low dose, followed up for a minimum of 3 days before proceeding to recruit further participants to receive the middle dose, and then after safety observation for 3 days, the last group of participants were recruited and allocated to receive the high dose. The administration of higher dose injections and new enrolment were paused if any criteria for pausing dose escalation were met. The protocol and informed consent were approved by the institutional review board of the Jiangsu Provincial Center of Disease Control and Prevention. Written informed consent from all participants was obtained before screening. This study was undertaken by Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was developed by Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Beijing, China) and CanSino Biologics (Tianjin, China). The vaccine is a replication defective Ad5 vectored vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. We cloned an optimised full-length spike gene based on Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number YP_009724390) with the tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide gene into an E1 and E3 deleted Ad5 vector, and constructed the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine using the Admax system from Microbix Biosystem (Toronto, ON, Canada). The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was manufactured as a liquid formulation containing 5 × 1010 viral particles per 0·5 mL in a vial. A single shot was allocated intramuscularly in the arm of the participants in the low dose group, with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (5 × 1010 viral particles per 0·5 mL). The participants in the middle dose group received one shot intramuscularly in the arm with two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (1 × 1011 viral particles per mL). Participants in the high dose group received a double-shot regimen with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in one arm and two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in the other arm (1·5 × 1011 viral particles per 1·5 mL). Adverse events were self-reported by the participants, but verified by investigators daily during the first 14 days after vaccination. Subsequently, adverse events were recorded by the participants on diary cards in the following weeks. Laboratory safety tests including white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophils, platelets, haemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine were measured on day 7 to assess any toxic effects post-vaccination. We graded adverse events and abnormal changes in laboratory tests according to the scale issued by the China State Food and Drug Administration (version 2019).11National Medical Products Administrationhttp://www.nmpa.gov.cn/WS04/CL2138/373037.htmlDate: 2019Date accessed: May 20, 2020Google Scholar Blood samples were taken from participants for serology tests at the scheduled site visits before the vaccination, and on days 14 and 28 after the vaccination. We assessed binding antibody responses against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike glycoprotein with ELISA kits manufactured by Beijing Wantai BioPharm (Beijing, China). A dilution of 1:40 was the positivity cutoff value for ELISA. We also measured the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination using both live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation (virus strain SARS-CoV-2/human/CHN/Wuhan_IME-BJ01/2020, GenBank number MT291831.1) and pseudovirus neutralisation tests (a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirus system expressing the spike glycoprotein).12Nie J Li Q Wu J et al.Establishment and validation of a pseudovirus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2.Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020; 9: 680-686Google Scholar Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood before the vaccination and at days 14 and 28 post-vaccination. Specific T-cell responses were quantified with an interferon (IFN) γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptide pools for about 12–24 h before detection, and expressed as the number of spot-forming cells per 100 000 cells. All measurements were subtracted from the unstimulated control values, and minus values were corrected to zero. The results were considered positive if there was at least a two-times increase in the number of IFNγ secreting T cells post-vaccination. We also assessed the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to vaccination according to the secretion of IFNγ, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), which were measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after the stimulation with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptide pools for about 6 h and detected by flow cytometry. Similar methods to measure T-cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining assays have been reported previously.13Ewer K Rampling T Venkatraman N et al.A monovalent chimpanzee adenovirus Ebola vaccine boosted with MVA.N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 1635-1646Google Scholar,  14De Santis O Audran R Pothin E et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine in healthy adults: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 1/2a study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2016; 16: 311-320Google Scholar The pre-vaccination and post-vaccination anti-Ad5 neutralising antibody titres were detected with a serum neutralisation assay.15Sprangers MC Lakhai W Koudstaal W et al.Quantifying adenovirus-neutralizing antibodies by luciferase transgene detection: addressing preexisting immunity to vaccine and gene therapy vectors.J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41: 5046-5052Google Scholar We analysed all outcomes in the intention-to-treat cohort. The primary endpoint for safety was the occurrence of adverse reactions within 7 days after the vaccination. Any abnormal changes in laboratory measures at 7 days post-vaccination, and adverse events within 28 days across the treatment groups were also analysed as secondary safety endpoints. The specific ELISA antibody titres to RBD and the spike glycoprotein, and the neutralising antibody amounts against live SARS-CoV-2 and a pseudovirus were measured as humoral immunogenicity endpoints. We defined a positive antibody response (seroconversion) as at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titre from baseline. ELISpot IFNγ and positive T-cell responses measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays were compared across the groups as endpoints for cell-mediated responses. Stratified analyses of the immune responses were done based on the pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres among the participants as low or negative (≤1:200) or high (>1:200). The sample size was not determined on the basis of statistical power calculations; however, a minimum sample size of 20–30 participants for a pilot vaccine trial has been recommended by the National Medical Products Administration, China. We assessed the number and proportion of participants with adverse reactions post-vaccination and compared safety profiles across the dose groups. The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were presented as geometric mean titres with 95% CIs and the cellular responses were shown as a proportion of positive responders. We used the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test to analyse categorical data, ANOVA to analyse the log transformed antibody titres, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for data that were not normally distributed. When the overall difference across the three groups was significant, pairwise comparisons were made and the differences between groups were estimated with 95% CIs. Multivariable analysis was used to establish the possible effects on the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine candidates. Hypothesis testing was two-sided with an α value of 0·05. Statistical analyses were done by a statistician using SAS (version 9.4) or GraphPad Prism 8·0·1. SPICE (version 6.0) was used for the analysis of data from multicolour flow cytometry experiments. An independent data and safety monitoring committee, with one independent statistician, one clinician, and one epidemiologist, was established before the start of the trial. Safety data for the first 3 days post-vaccination were assessed and reviewed by the committee to ensure that there was sufficient holding time between dose escalation.

Between March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 were sequentially enrolled and assigned to receive the low dose (n=36 [33%]), middle dose (n=36 [33%]), or high dose (n=36 [33%]) of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (appendix p 2). All participants completed the vaccination and the scheduled visits within 28 days. Baseline characteristics of the participants were similar across the treatment groups (table 1).Table 1Baseline characteristicsLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)Age, years18–299 (25%)12 (33%)10 (28%)30–3913 (36%)14 (39%)15 (42%)40–498 (22%)3 (8%)7 (19%)50–606 (17%)7 (19%)4 (11%)Mean age, years37·2 (10·7)36·3 (11·5)35·5 (10·1)SexMale18 (50%)19 (53%)18 (50%)Female18 (50%)17 (47%)18 (50%)Mean body-mass index, kg/m223·3 (2·7)23·9 (2·7)24·1 (3·1)Underlying diseases** Seven participants had hypertension, chronic bronchitis, gout, or were a carrier of hepatitis B virus.Yes1 (3%)2 (6%)4 (11%)No35 (97%)34 (94%)32 (89%)Pre-existing adenovirus type-5 neutralising antibodyMean GMT168·9 (13·9)149·5 (10·5)115·0 (13·4)≤200, titre16 (44%)17 (47%)20 (56%)>200, titre20 (56%)19 (53%)16 (44%)Data are n (%) or mean (SD).

No significant difference in the overall number of adverse reactions across the treatment groups was observed. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients. Pain was reported in 17 (47%) participants in the low dose group, 20 (56%) participants in the middle dose group, and 21 (58%) participants in the high dose group. The most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions overall were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]). Fever was reported in 15 (42%) participants in the low dose group, 15 (42%) participants in the middle dose group, and 20 (56%) participants in the high dose group. Headache was reported in 14 (39%) participants in the low dose group, 11 (31%) participants in the middle dose group, and 17 (47%) participants in the high dose group. Muscle pain was reported in seven (19%) participants in the low dose group, three (8%) participants in the middle dose group, and eight (22%) participants in the high dose group. Most adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Nine participants (two [6%] in the low dose group, two [6%] in the middle dose group, and five [14%] in the high dose group) had an episode of severe fever (grade 3) with axillary temperature greater than 38·5°C. Of them, one (3%) from the high dose group reported severe fever along with severe symptoms of fatigue, dyspnoea, and muscle pain. One participant in the high dose group reported severe fatigue and joint pain (appendix p 3). These reactions occurred within 24 h post-vaccination, and persisted for no more than 48 h. We found no significant difference in the incidences of adverse reactions or overall adverse events among the dose groups. High pre-existing Ad5 immunity (titre of >1:200 vs ≤1:200) was associated with significantly fewer occurrences of fever post-vaccination (odds ratio 0·3, 95% CI 0·1–0·6; appendix p 4). No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days. At day 7 after vaccination, nine (8%) participants had mild to moderate total bilirubin increase, ten (9%) had alanine aminotransferase increase, and four (4%) had fasting hyperglycaemia (appendix p 5), but no instances were considered as clinically significant.Table 2Adverse reactions within 7 days and overall adverse events within 28 days after vaccinationLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)Total (N=108)All adverse reactions within 0–7 daysAny30 (83%)30 (83%)27 (75%)87 (81%)Grade 32 (6%)2 (6%)6 (17%)10 (9%)Injection site adverse reactions within 0–7 daysPain17 (47%)20 (56%)21 (58%)58 (54%)Induration2 (6%)1 (3%)1 (3%)4 (4%)Redness2 (6%)1 (3%)1 (3%)4 (4%)Swelling4 (11%)4 (11%)08 (7%)Itch2 (6%)3 (8%)05 (5%)Muscular weakness001 (3%)1 (1%)Systemic adverse reactions within 0–7 daysFever15 (42%)15 (42%)20 (56%)50 (46%)Grade 3 fever2 (6%)2 (6%)5 (14%)9 (8%)Headache14 (39%)11 (31%)17 (47%)42 (39%)Fatigue17 (47%)14 (39%)16 (44%)47 (44%)Grade 3 fatigue002 (6%)2 (2%)Vomiting1 (3%)01 (3%)2 (2%)Diarrhoea3 (8%)4 (11%)5 (14%)12 (11%)Muscle pain7 (19%)3 (8%)8 (22%)18 (17%)Grade 3 muscle pain001 (3%)1 (1%)Joint pain2 (6%)2 (6%)5 (14%)9 (8%)Grade 3 joint pain001 (3%)1 (1%)Throat pain1 (3%)3 (8%)4 (11%)8 (7%)Cough1 (3%)2 (6%)3 (8%)6 (6%)Nausea2 (6%)1 (3%)3 (8%)6 (6%)Functional GI disorder1 (3%)001 (1%)Dyspnoea002 (6%)2 (2%)Grade 3 dyspnoea001 (3%)1 (1%)Appetite impaired6 (17%)5 (14%)6 (17%)17 (16%)Dizziness1 (3%)01 (3%)2 (2%)Mucosal abnormality001 (3%)1 (1%)Pruritus1 (3%)1 (3%)1 (3%)3 (3%)Overall adverse events within 0–28 daysAny31 (86%)30 (83%)27 (75%)88 (81%)Grade 32 (6%)2 (6%)6 (17%)10 (9%)Data are n (%).

Grade 3=severe (ie, prevented activity). GI=gastrointestinal. Rapid binding antibody responses to RBD were observed in all three dose groups from day 14 (table 3). At day 28, the recipients in the high dose group tended to have a higher binding antibody geometric mean titre of 1445·8 (95% CI 935·5–2234·5), followed by 806·0 (528·2–1229·9) in the middle dose group, and 615·8 (405·4–935·5) in the low dose group (high dose vs low dose 1611·5, 531·5–2691·5). At least a four-fold increase of anti-RBD antibodies was noted in 35 (97%) of 36 participants in the low dose group, 34 (94%) of 36 in the middle dose group, and 36 (100%) of 36 in the high dose group. Neutralising antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 were all negative at day 0, and increased moderately at day 14, peaking at 28 days post-vaccination. Neutralising antibody titre with a geometric mean titre of 34·0 (95% CI 22·6–50·1) was noted in the high dose group, which was significantly higher compared with 16·2 (10·4–25·2) in the middle dose group and 14·5 (9·6–21·8) in the low dose group, with an estimated difference of 27·7 (1·0–54·4) between the high dose group and the middle dose group and 33·2 (6·5–59·9) between the high dose group and the low dose group at day 28. Meanwhile, 18 (50%) participants in the low dose group, 18 (50%) in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) in the high dose group had at least a four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titres by day 28. Similar patterns of the binding antibody to spike glycoprotein and neutralising antibody titre to pseudovirus post-vaccination across the dose groups were also noted (appendix p 6). The association between the ELISA antibodies to RBD and neutralising antibody titres against live virus showed a moderate positive correlation of 0·749, and that between the ELISA antibodies to spike glycoprotein and neutralising antibody titres against live virus was 0·753, at the peak antibody response (p<0·0001). The neutralising antibody titres measured using a pseudovirus were also correlated well with those measured by live SARS-CoV-2 (appendix p 7).Table 3Specific antibody responses to the receptor binding domain, and neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2Day 14Day 28Low dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)p valueLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)p valueELISA antibodies to the receptor binding domainGMT76·5 (44·3–132·0)91·2 (55·9–148·7)132·6 (80·7–218·0)0·29615·8 (405·4–935·5)806·0 (528·2–1229·9)1445·8 (935·5–2234·5)0·016≥4-fold increase16 (44%)18 (50%)22 (61%)0·3535 (97%)34 (94%)36 (100%)0·77Neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2GMT8·2 (5·8–11·5)9·6 (6·6–14·1)12·7 (8·5–19·0)0·2414·5 (9·6–21·8)16·2 (10·4–25·2)34·0 (22·6–50·1)0·0082≥4-fold increase10 (28%)11 (31%)15 (42%)0·4218 (50%)18 (50%)27 (75%)0·046Data are mean (95% CI) or n (%).

Before vaccination, 20 (56%) participants in the low dose group, 19 (53%) participants in the middle dose group, and 16 (44%) participants in the high dose group had a high pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titre (>1:200). Only five (25%) participants of 20 in the low dose group, seven (37%) participants of 19 in the middle dose group, and ten (63%) participants of 16 in the high dose group, who had high pre-existing Ad5 immunity, had at least a four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titre at day 28 post-vaccination (appendix pp 8–10). Multivariable analysis showed that high pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres compromised the seroconversion of neutralising antibody post-vaccination, regardless of the vaccine doses, and recipients aged 45–60 years seemed to have lower seroconversion of neutralising antibody compared with the younger recipients (appendix p 11). The Ad5 neutralising antibodies were significantly boosted post-vaccination (appendix p 12). ELISpot responses at baseline were undetectable with spot-forming cells below the level of detection of the assay in all participants, but peaked at day 14 post-vaccination. The proportions of positive responders ranged from 83–97% across the dose groups, with a mean number of spot-forming cells per 100 000 cells of 20·8 (95% CI 12·7–34·0) in the low dose group, 40·8 (27·6–60·3) in the middle dose group, and 58·0 (39·1–85·9) in the high dose group (figure 1). T-cell responses in the high dose group were significantly higher than that in the low dose group (p<0·0010), but not significant compared with that in the middle dose group. A slight decrease of the T-cell responses across the dose groups was noted at day 28. High levels of baseline Ad5 neutralising antibody titre reduced the peak of post-vaccination T-cell responses in all the dose groups, particularly for the low dose group. Despite the effect of high pre-existing Ad5 immunity, positive responders were identified in 15 (75%) of 20 participants in the low dose group, 18 (95%) of 19 participants in the middle dose group, and 15 (94%) of 16 participants in the high dose group at day 14, and 12 (60%) of 20 participants in the low dose group, 16 (84%) of 19 participants in the middle dose group, and 16 (100%) of 16 participants in the high dose group at day 28.Figure 1Specific T-cell response measured by ELISpotShow full caption(A) The number of specific T cells with secretion of IFNγ at days 0, 14, and 28 in all participants, and stratified by pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres.

IFNγ was detected from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after the vaccination at day 14 and 28, in all dose groups (figure 2, appendix p 13). The TNFα expression from CD4+ T cells tended to be significantly lower in the low dose group than that in the high dose (p<0·0001) and middle dose groups (p=0·0032), on day 14. The TNFα expression from CD8+ T cells showed an overall p value of less than 0·0001 across the three groups on day 14. And the TNFα expression from CD8+ T cells tended to be higher in the high dose group than that in both the middle dose group (p=0·016) and the low dose group (p<0·0001). The p values are for the pairwise comparisons between groups. Amounts of IL-2 detected from CD4+ T cells were higher than that detected from CD8+ cells. The proportions of polyfunctional phenotypes detected from memory CD4+ T cells were higher than those from CD8+ T cells. Higher proportions of polyfunctional phenotypes were noted with the higher vaccine doses. We also noted that pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody had a negative effect on the pattern of T-cell responses (appendix pp 14–16). A post-hoc analysis showed that 28 (78%) participants in the low dose group, 33 (92%) participants in the middle dose group, and 36 (100%) participants in the high dose group showed either positive T-cell responses to spike glycoprotein or seroconversion of neutralising antibody to live SARS-CoV-2, at day 28 post-vaccination (appendix p 17).Figure 2Flow cytometry with intracellular cytokine staining before and after vaccinationShow full caption(A) Percentage of cells secreting IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 from CD4+ T cells.

To exclude any possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the study period, we tested the serum antibodies to nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in participants at day 28 using a special IgG/IgM rapid test kit (Vazyme Biotech, number CD101, Nanjing, China), but none of the participants were positive. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a first-in-human clinical trial of a novel Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerated in healthy adults in all three dose groups. The most common adverse reactions were fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain with no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions across the groups. Most adverse events reported were mild or moderate in severity. We noticed a higher reactogenicity profile of the high dose at 1·5 × 1011 viral particles, presenting as severe fever, fatigue, muscle pain, or joint pain, which might be associated with viraemia caused by Ad5 vector infection. However, the severe adverse reactions were transient and self-limiting. Additionally, no abnormal changes in laboratory measurements were clinically significant or considered to be related to the vaccine. The profile of adverse events reported in this trial is similar to that of another Ad5 vector-based Ebola vaccine expressing glycoprotein.16Zhu FC Hou LH Li JX et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a novel recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine in healthy adults in China: preliminary report of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial.Lancet. 2015; 385: 2272-2279Google Scholar To accelerate the process of clinical evaluation of the candidate COVID-19 vaccine, we selected doses for the phase 2 study mainly on the basis of the safety profile of the candidate vaccines shown in the participants within 7 days and 14 days post-vaccination. We chose the low dose (5 × 1010 viral particles) and middle dose (1 × 1011 viral particles) to be further assessed in a phase 2 clinical trial. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was immunogenic, inducing humoral and T-cell responses rapidly in most participants. Onset of detectable immune responses was rapid, with T-cell responses peaking at day 14 after vaccination and antibodies peaking at day 28. The antibody response to the vaccine in the high dose group was slightly greater than that in the middle dose and low dose groups. A single dose of Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was able to elicit a four-fold increase in binding antibodies to RBD in 94–100% of participants, and a four-fold increase to live virus in 50–75% of participants. Despite differences in magnitudes of the antibodies measured through different methods, there was a strong positive correlation between binding antibodies and neutralising antibody titres to the live virus. High proportions of participants with positive T-cell responses were noted across the all dose groups post-vaccination. The activation of both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was observed in vaccine recipients, particularly for antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. However, both the specific antibody response and T-cell response induced by vaccination were partly diminished by the presence of high pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity. Currently, correlates of protection for a vaccine against COVID-19 are unknown, and the roles of the specific antibodies or T cells in building effective protection are not yet defined. Therefore, we are unable to predict the protection of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine on the basis of the vaccine-elicited immune responses in this study. However, previous studies investigating SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) found that the increases in specific antibodies were temporary, and declined quickly in patients after recovery, whereas the specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses played an essential role in immunity.17Zhao J Zhao J Perlman S T cell responses are required for protection from clinical disease and for virus clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected mice.J Virol. 2010; 84: 9318-9325Google Scholar,  18Channappanavar R Fett C Zhao J Meyerholz DK Perlman S Virus-specific memory CD8 T cells provide substantial protection from lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.J Virol. 2014; 88: 11034-11044Google Scholar A similar rapid decline of the specific antibody amounts in patients with COVID-19 after recovery was also noted,19Wang X Guo X Xin Q et al.Neutralizing antibodies responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients.medRxiv. 2020;  (DOI: 2020.04.15.20065623 (preprint))Google Scholar,  20Wu F Wang A Liu M et al.Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications.medRxiv. 2020;  (DOI: 2020.03.30.20047365 (preprint))Google Scholar suggesting that both specific cellular and humoral immunity are potentially important for a successful COVID-19 vaccine. Here, we only report the data within 28 days after the vaccination, but we are going to follow up the vaccine recipients for at least 6 months, so more data will be obtained. This study was done in Wuhan, Hubei province, which was the centre of the COVID-19 epidemic in China.21Chen N Zhou M Dong X et al.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 507-513Google Scholar People living in the city of Wuhan had a much higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those living in other cities outside of Hubei province, even though when we initiated this trial, the city had already begun lockdown and implemented mandatory home isolation for residents. Therefore, we did serological screening, nucleic acid testing, and chest CT to exclude participants who had been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during recruitment. In addition, we arranged for all participants in our study to stay in a designated hotel for 14 days post-vaccination. This arrangement facilitated the observation of adverse events after the immunisation of the participants, and reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the following 2 weeks. These measures allowed the study to be done successfully without interference by the circulation of SARS-CoV-2, which is especially important in the absence of a placebo control. Interpretation of the results of this study is limited by the small size of the cohort, the short duration of follow-up, and the absence of a randomised control group. As it was a first-in-human study of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine, it was not designed to measure the vaccine efficacy. However, in preclinical studies, seven out of eight ferrets were protected from having detectable virus copies when challenged by SARS-CoV-2 through nasal dripping 21 days after immunisation with the vaccine, whereas only one out of eight ferrets in the control group was negative for virus copies (Wei C, unpublished). We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the candidate vaccine in healthy adults, with no interference by underlying diseases or medicines. However, results of our study indicated that older age could have a negative effect on the vaccine-elicited responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this trial, no participants were older than 60 years and only 16% of the participants were older than 50 years, providing limited information on the capability of generating a potent cellular and humoral response in the older population. Since age has also been identified as an independent risk factor for severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,4Weiss P Murdoch DR Clinical course and mortality risk of severe COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1014-1015Google Scholar,  22Ye G Pan Z Pan Y et al.Clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reactivation.J Infect. 2020; 80: e14-e17Google Scholar and there is a possibility that an even lower immune response might be found in the older population, we are going to include participants who are older than 60 years in the phase 2 study considering this population as an important target population for a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, experience with vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS have raised concerns about the antibody-dependent enhancement in participants who are infected with a circulating SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination.23Lurie N Saville M Hatchett R Halton J Developing Covid-19 vaccines at pandemic speed.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (NEJMp2005630.)Google Scholar However, this study was not statistically powered to measure any safety outcome, especially for the concerns around immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement events associated with the full-length spike glycoprotein vaccine antigen.24Cao X COVID-19: immunopathology and its implications for therapy.Nat Rev Immunol. 2020; 20: 269-270Google Scholar Our study found that the pre-existing Ad5 immunity could slow down the rapid immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and also lower the peak of the responses, particularly for humoral immunity. The high pre-existing Ad5 immunity might also have a negative effect on the persistence of the vaccine-elicited immune responses. In previous studies, heterologous prime-boost combinations or homologous prime-boost regimens with Ad5 vectored vaccines were shown to be able to induce more strong and durable immunogenic responses in populations with high pre-existing Ad5 immunity.25Venkatraman N Ndiaye BP Bowyer G et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous prime-boost Ebola virus vaccine regimen in healthy adults in the United Kingdom and Senegal.J Infect Dis. 2019; 219: 1187-1197Google Scholar,  26Dolzhikova IV Zubkova OV Tukhvatulin AI et al.Safety and immunogenicity of GamEvac-Combi, a heterologous VSV- and Ad5-vectored Ebola vaccine: an open phase I/II trial in healthy adults in Russia.Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017; 13: 613-620Google Scholar,  27Shukarev G Callendret B Luhn K Douoguih M A two-dose heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimen eliciting sustained immune responses to Ebola Zaire could support a preventive strategy for future outbreaks.Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017; 13: 266-270Google Scholar Nevertheless, limited information is available for the effects of multiple doses of the candidate Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in humans, which warrants further investigation. Over the past decade, the vaccine industry and clinical research centres have been asked to provide urgent responses to epidemics of emerging infectious diseases, such as H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus, Zika, MERS, and now SARS-CoV-2.23Lurie N Saville M Hatchett R Halton J Developing Covid-19 vaccines at pandemic speed.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (NEJMp2005630.)Google Scholar The risk of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, making the need for effective vaccines even more urgent.28Richardson S Hirsch JS Narasimhan M et al.Presenting characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area.JAMA. 2020;  (published online April 22.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.6775Google Scholar We started the development of this candidate vaccine in January, 2020, when SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated and sequenced. The full-length spike glycoprotein was selected as the vaccine antigen, mainly on the basis of previous experience with SARS and MERS vaccines. Previous findings suggested that those vaccines expressing full-length spike glycoprotein can induce good immune responses and protective efficacy.29Yong CY Ong HK Yeap SK Ho KL Tan WS Recent advances in the vaccine development against Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus.Front Microbiol. 2019; 101781Google Scholar Although the RBD comprises the critical neutralising domains for the coronaviruses, the neutralising epitopes located outside the RBD were also identified.30Duan J Yan X Guo X et al.A human SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody against epitope on S2 protein.Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005; 333: 186-193Google Scholar,  31Wang Q Zhang L Kuwahara K et al.Immunodominant SARS coronavirus epitopes in humans elicited both enhancing and neutralizing effects on infection in non-human primates.ACS Infect Dis. 2016; 2: 361-376Google Scholar The full-length spike was chosen in most of the viral vectored, mRNA, or DNA COVID-19 vaccines in development.9WHODRAFT landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines–30 April 2020.https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccinesDate: 2020Date accessed: May 5, 2020Google Scholar The Ad5 vector vaccine platform is highly efficient and well established as a vaccine antigen delivery system.

We plan to monitor the participants in our upcoming phase 2 and phase 3 studies to assess the indication for any such acquisition. In conclusion, we found that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic in healthy adults. Specific humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination, and rapid, specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 after one shot of the vaccine. There is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for the control of the COVID-19 outbreak. An ongoing phase 2 trial in China (NCT04341389) will provide more information on the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine. Contributors F-CZ and Y-HL were co-first authors.

There is an urgent need for effective treatment. Current focus has been on the development of novel therapeutics, including antivirals and vaccines.

We recommend identification and treatment of hyperinflammation using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality. Current management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality.2Ruan Q Yang K Wang W Jiang L Song J Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China.Intensive Care Med. 2020;  (published online March 3.)DOI:10.1007/s00134-020-05991-xGoogle Scholar Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is an under-recognised, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure.

We aim to describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, and to compare the clinical features between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. We hope our study findings will inform the global community of the emergence of this novel coronavirus and its clinical features. Following the pneumonia cases of unknown cause reported in Wuhan and considering the shared history of exposure to Huanan seafood market across the patients, an epidemiological alert was released by the local health authority on Dec 31, 2019, and the market was shut down on Jan 1, 2020. Meanwhile, 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were transferred to a designated hospital starting from Dec 31, 2019. An expert team of physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, and government officials was soon formed after the alert. Since the cause was unknown at the onset of these emerging infections, the diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan was based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia. Suspected patients were isolated using airborne precautions in the designated hospital, Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China), and fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures were taken. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Local centres for disease control and prevention collected respiratory, blood, and faeces specimens, then shipped them to designated authoritative laboratories to detect the pathogen (NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Mérieux Laboratory, Beijing, China). A novel coronavirus, which was named 2019-nCoV, was isolated then from lower respiratory tract specimen and a diagnostic test for this virus was developed soon after that.14Tan W Zhao X Ma X et al.A novel coronavirus genome identified in a cluster of pneumonia cases — Wuhan, China 2019−2020.http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/a3907201-f64f-4154-a19e-4253b453d10cDate accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Of 59 suspected cases, 41 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. The presence of 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens was detected by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. The primers and probe target to envelope gene of CoV were used and the sequences were as follows: forward primer 5′-ACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTTTCGTGGT-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCAGCAGTACGCACACAATC-3′; and the probe 5′CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3′BHQ1. Conditions for the amplifications were 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s. Initial investigations included a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes). Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, or bronchial aspirates were tested for common viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed. Given the emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases during the influenza season, antibiotics (orally and intravenously) and oseltamivir (orally 75 mg twice daily) were empirically administered. Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 40–120 mg per day) was given as a combined regimen if severe community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed by physicians at the designated hospital. Oxygen support (eg, nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) was administered to patients according to the severity of hypoxaemia. Repeated tests for 2019-nCoV were done in patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection to show viral clearance before hospital discharge or discontinuation of isolation. We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays for all patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection who were reported by the local health authority. The admission data of these patients was from Dec 16, 2019, to Jan 2, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardised data collection forms (modified case record form for severe acute respiratory infection clinical characterisation shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) from electronic medical records. Two researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected. To ascertain the epidemiological and symptom data, which were not available from electronic medical records, the researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. To characterise the effect of coronavirus on the production of cytokines or chemokines in the acute phase of the illness, plasma cytokines and chemokines (IL1B, IL1RA, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8 (also known as CXCL8), IL9, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL15, IL17A, Eotaxin (also known as CCL11), basic FGF2, GCSF (CSF3), GMCSF (CSF2), IFNγ, IP10 (CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2), MIP1A (CCL3), MIP1B (CCL4), PDGFB, RANTES (CCL5), TNFα, and VEGFA were measured using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma samples from four healthy adults were used as controls for cross-comparison. The median time from being transferred to a designated hospital to the blood sample collection was 4 days (IQR 2–5). Each 80 μL plasma sample from the patients and contacts was added into 240 μL of Trizol LS (10296028; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 μL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 μL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final reaction mix concentration of the primers was 500 nM and probe was 200 nM. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: 50°C for 15 min and 95°C for 3 min, 50 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 45 s. Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead. RNAaemia was defined as a positive result for real-time RT-PCR in the plasma sample. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock were defined according to the interim guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus.9WHONovel coronavirus – China.http://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/Date: Jan 12, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) of less than 300 mm Hg.15Sanz F Gimeno C Lloret T et al.Relationship between the presence of hypoxemia and the inflammatory response measured by C-reactive protein in bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia.Eur Respir J. 2011; 38: 2492Google Scholar Acute kidney injury was identified and classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification.16Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) acute kidney injury work groupKDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury.https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guideline-English.pdfDate: March, 2012Date accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Secondary infection was diagnosed if the patients had clinical symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteraemia, and was combined with a positive culture of a new pathogen from a lower respiratory tract specimen (including the sputum, transtracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or from blood samples taken ≥48 h after admission).17Garner JS Jarvis WR Emori TG Horan TC Hughes JM CDC definitions for nosocomial infections, 1988.Am J Infect Control. 1988; 16: 128-140Google Scholar Cardiac injury followed the definition used in our previous study in H7N9 patients.18Gao C Wang Y Gu X et al.Association between cardiac injury and mortality in hospitalized patients infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus.Crit Care Med. 2020;  (published online Jan 20)DOI:10.1097/CCM.0000000000004207Google Scholar In brief, cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography. Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared by χ2 test or Fisher's exact test between ICU care and no ICU care groups. Boxplots were drawn to describe plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations. A two-sided α of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software, version 9.4, unless otherwise indicated.

By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan. 20 [49%]) of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients were aged 25–49 years, and 14 (34%) were aged 50–64 years (figure 1A). The median age of the patients was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0; table 1). In our cohort of the first 41 patients as of Jan 2, no children or adolescents were infected. Of the 41 patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to the ICU because they required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxaemia. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%]); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).Figure 1Date of illness onset and age distribution of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infectionShow full caption(A) Number of hospital admissions by age group.

Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care (nine [69%]) and those with non-ICU care (18 [64%]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The first fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38; table 1). More than half of patients (22 [55%] of 40) developed dyspnoea. The median duration from illness onset to dyspnoea was 8·0 days (IQR 5·0–13·0). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7·0 days (4·0–8·0), to shortness of breath was 8·0 days (5·0–13·0), to ARDS was 9·0 days (8·0–14·0), to mechanical ventilation was 10·5 days (7·0–14·0), and to ICU admission was 10·5 days (8·0–17·0; figure 2).Figure 2Timeline of 2019-nCoV cases after onset of illnessView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) The blood counts of patients on admission showed leucopenia (white blood cell count less than 4 × 109/L; ten [25%] of 40 patients) and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1·0 × 109/L; 26 [63%] patients; table 2). Prothrombin time and D-dimer level on admission were higher in ICU patients (median prothrombin time 12·2 s [IQR 11·2–13·4]; median D-dimer level 2·4 mg/L [0·6–14·4]) than non-ICU patients (median prothrombin time 10·7 s [9·8–12·1], p=0·012; median D-dimer level 0·5 mg/L [0·3–0·8], p=0·0042).

Hypersensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) was increased substantially in five patients, in whom the diagnosis of virus-related cardiac injury was made.Table 2Laboratory findings of patients infected with 2019-nCoV on admission to hospitalAll patients (n=41)ICU care (n=13)No ICU care (n=28)p valueWhite blood cell count, × 109/L6·2 (4·1–10·5)11·3 (5·8–12·1)5·7 (3·1–7·6)0·011<410/40 (25%)1/13 (8%)9/27 (33%)0·0414–1018/40 (45%)5/13 (38%)13/27 (48%)..>1012/40 (30%)7/13 (54%)5/27 (19%)..Neutrophil count, × 109/L5·0 (3·3–8·9)10·6 (5·0–11·8)4·4 (2·0–6·1)0·00069Lymphocyte count, × 109/L0·8 (0·6–1·1)0·4 (0·2–0·8)1·0 (0·7–1·1)0·0041<1·026/41 (63%)11/13 (85%)15/28 (54%)0·045≥1·015/41 (37%)2/13 (15%)13/28 (46%)..Haemoglobin, g/L126·0 (118·0–140·0)122·0 (111·0–128·0)130·5 (120·0–140·0)0·20Platelet count, × 109/L164·5 (131·5–263·0)196·0 (165·0–263·0)149·0 (131·0–263·0)0·45<1002/40 (5%)1/13 (8%)1/27 (4%)0·45≥10038/40 (95%)12/13 (92%)26/27 (96%)..Prothrombin time, s11·1 (10·1–12·4)12·2 (11·2–13·4)10·7 (9·8–12·1)0·012Activated partial thromboplastin time, s27·0 (24·2–34·1)26·2 (22·5–33·9)27·7 (24·8–34·1)0·57D-dimer, mg/L0·5 (0·3–1·3)2·4 (0·6–14·4)0·5 (0·3–0·8)0·0042Albumin, g/L31·4 (28·9–36·0)27·9 (26·3–30·9)34·7 (30·2–36·5)0·00066Alanine aminotransferase, U/L32·0 (21·0–50·0)49·0 (29·0–115·0)27·0 (19·5–40·0)0·038Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L34·0 (26·0–48·0)44·0 (30·0–70·0)34·0 (24·0–40·5)0·10≤4026/41 (63%)5/13 (38%)21/28 (75%)0·025>4015/41 (37%)8/13 (62%)7/28 (25%)..Total bilirubin, mmol/L11·7 (9·5–13·9)14·0 (11·9–32·9)10·8 (9·4–12·3)0·011Potassium, mmol/L4·2 (3·8–4·8)4·6 (4·0–5·0)4·1 (3·8–4·6)0·27Sodium, mmol/L139·0 (137·0–140·0)138·0 (137·0–139·0)139·0 (137·5–140·5)0·26Creatinine, μmol/L74·2 (57·5–85·7)79·0 (53·1–92·7)73·3 (57·5–84·7)0·84≤13337/41 (90%)11/13 (85%)26/28 (93%)0·42>1334/41 (10%)2/13 (15%)2/28 (7%)..Creatine kinase, U/L132·5 (62·0–219·0)132·0 (82·0–493·0)133·0 (61·0–189·0)0·31≤18527/40 (68%)7/13 (54%)20/27 (74%)0·21>18513/40 (33%)6/13 (46%)7/27 (26%)..Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L286·0 (242·0–408·0)400·0 (323·0–578·0)281·0 (233·0–357·0)0·0044≤24511/40 (28%)1/13 (8%)10/27 (37%)0·036>24529/40 (73%)12/13 (92%)17/27 (63%)..Hypersensitive troponin I, pg/mL3·4 (1·1–9·1)3·3 (3·0–163·0)3·5 (0·7–5·4)0·075>28 (99th percentile)5/41 (12%)4/13 (31%)1/28 (4%)0·017Procalcitonin, ng/mL0·1 (0·1–0·1)0·1 (0·1–0·4)0·1 (0·1–0·1)0·031<0·127/39 (69%)6/12 (50%)21/27 (78%)0·029≥0·1 to <0·257/39 (18%)3/12 (25%)4/27 (15%)..≥0·25 to <0·52/39 (5%)0/122/27 (7%)..≥0·53/39 (8%)3/12 (25%)** Complicated typical secondary infection during the first hospitalisation.0/27..Bilateral involvement of chest radiographs40/41 (98%)13/13 (100%)27/28 (96%)0·68Cycle threshold of respiratory tract32·2 (31·0–34·5)31·1 (30·0–33·5)32·2 (31·1–34·7)0·39Data are median (IQR) or n/N (%), where N is the total number of patients with available data. p values comparing ICU care and no ICU care are from χ2, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test. 2019-nCoV=2019 novel coronavirus.

Three of the four patients with secondary infection had procalcitonin greater than 0·5 ng/mL (0·69 ng/mL, 1·46 ng/mL, and 6·48 ng/mL). On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. Of the 41 patients, 40 (98%) had bilateral involvement (table 2). The typical findings of chest CT images of ICU patients on admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3A). The representative chest CT findings of non-ICU patients showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3B). Later chest CT images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, whereas the consolidation had been resolved (figure 3C).Figure 3Chest CT imagesShow full caption(A) Transverse chest CT images from a 40-year-old man showing bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation on day 15 after symptom onset.

Initial plasma IL1B, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNFα, and VEGF concentrations were higher in both ICU patients and non-ICU patients than in healthy adults (appendix pp 6–7). Plasma levels of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between healthy adults and patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Further comparison between ICU and non-ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα were higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients. All patients had pneumonia. Common complications included ARDS (12 [29%] of 41 patients), followed by RNAaemia (six [15%] patients), acute cardiac injury (five [12%] patients), and secondary infection (four [10%] patients; table 3). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in four (10%) patients, with two of them (5%) had refractory hypoxaemia and received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as salvage therapy. All patients were administered with empirical antibiotic treatment, and 38 (93%) patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir). Additionally, nine (22%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. A comparison of clinical features between patients who received and did not receive systematic corticosteroids is in the appendix (pp 1–5).Table 3Treatments and outcomes of patients infected with 2019-nCoVAll patients (n=41)ICU care (n=13)No ICU care (n=28)p valueDuration from illness onset to first admission7·0 (4·0–8·0)7·0 (4·0–8·0)7·0 (4·0–8·5)0·87ComplicationsAcute respiratory distress syndrome12 (29%)11 (85%)1 (4%)<0·0001RNAaemia6 (15%)2 (15%)4 (14%)0·93Cycle threshold of RNAaemia35·1 (34·7–35·1)35·1 (35·1–35·1)34·8 (34·1–35·4)0·35Acute cardiac injury** Defined as blood levels of hypersensitive troponin I above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/mL) or new abnormalities shown on electrocardiography and echocardiography.5 (12%)4 (31%)1 (4%)0·017Acute kidney injury3 (7%)3 (23%)00·027Secondary infection4 (10%)4 (31%)00·0014Shock3 (7%)3 (23%)00·027TreatmentAntiviral therapy38 (93%)12 (92%)26 (93%)0·46Antibiotic therapy41 (100%)13 (100%)28 (100%)NAUse of corticosteroid9 (22%)6 (46%)3 (11%)0·013Continuous renal replacement therapy3 (7%)3 (23%)00·027Oxygen support......<0·0001Nasal cannula27 (66%)1 (8%)26 (93%)..Non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula10 (24%)8 (62%)2 (7%)..Invasive mechanical ventilation2 (5%)2 (15%)0..Invasive mechanical ventilation and ECMO2 (5%)2 (15%)0..Prognosis......0·014Hospitalisation7 (17%)1 (8%)6 (21%)..Discharge28 (68%)7 (54%)21 (75%)..Death6 (15%)5 (38%)1 (4%)..Data are median (IQR) or n (%). p values are comparing ICU care and no ICU care. 2019-nCoV=2019 novel coronavirus.

Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least 10 days, with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from upper respiratory tract. We report here a cohort of 41 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Patients had serious, sometimes fatal, pneumonia and were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan, China, by Jan 2, 2020. Clinical presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. The time between hospital admission and ARDS was as short as 2 days. At this stage, the mortality rate is high for 2019-nCoV, because six (15%) of 41 patients in this cohort died. The number of deaths is rising quickly. As of Jan 24, 2020, 835 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections were reported in China, with 25 fatal cases. Reports have been released of exported cases in many provinces in China, and in other countries; some health-care workers have also been infected in Wuhan. Taken together, evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019-nCoV. We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission.19Perlman S Netland J Coronaviruses post-SARS: update on replication and pathogenesis.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009; 7: 439-450Google Scholar Airborne precautions, such as a fit-tested N95 respirator, and other personal protective equipment are strongly recommended. To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored among health-care workers. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymptomatic infections. Similarities of clinical features between 2019-nCoV and previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans. These features of 2019-nCoV infection bear some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.20Lee N Hui D Wu A et al.A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.N Engl J Med. 2003; 348: 1986-1994Google Scholar,  21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761Google Scholar However, few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway. Furthermore, 2019-nCoV patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhoea), whereas about 20–25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhoea.21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761Google Scholar Faecal and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage. The pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum (eg, IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1) were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103Google Scholar MERS-CoV infection was also reported to induce increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL15, and IL17).23Mahallawi WH Khabour OF Zhang Q Makhdoum HM Suliman BA MERS-CoV infection in humans is associated with a pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokine profile.Cytokine. 2018; 104: 8-13Google Scholar We noted that patients infected with 2019-nCoV also had high amounts of IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity. However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103Google Scholar Further studies are necessary to characterise the Th1 and Th2 responses in 2019-nCoV infection and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Autopsy or biopsy studies would be the key to understand the disease.

However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance.27Stockman LJ Bellamy R Garner P SARS: systematic review of treatment effects.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e343Google Scholar,  28Lansbury L Rodrigo C Leonardi-Bee J Nguyen-Van-Tam J Lim WS Corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019; 2: CD010406Google Scholar,  29Arabi YM Mandourah Y Al-Hameed F et al.Corticosteroid therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome.Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2018; 197: 757-767Google Scholar Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance.30WHOClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.https://www.who.int/internal-publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspectedDate: Jan 11, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Among our cohort of 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection, corticosteroids were given to very few non-ICU cases, and low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids were given to less than half of severely ill patients with ARDS. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients infected with 2019-nCoV. No antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. In a historical control study,31Chu CM Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes). Arabi and colleagues initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection in Saudi Arabia.32Arabi YM Alothman A Balkhy HH et al.Treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome with a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-β1b (MIRACLE trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.Trials. 2018; 19: 81Google Scholar Preclinical evidence showed the potent efficacy of remdesivir (a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug) to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections.33Sheahan TP Sims AC Graham RL et al.Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses.Sci Transl Med. 2017; 9eaal3653Google Scholar,  34Sheahan TP Sims AC Leist SR et al.Comparative therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir and combination lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 222Google Scholar As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus. Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection. Our study has some limitations. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariable-adjusted methods. This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity. At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively.35Cui J Li F Shi Z-L Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2019; 17: 181-192Google Scholar Extensive research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has driven the discovery of many SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses in bats.

Reliable quick pathogen tests and feasible differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians in their first contact with suspected patients. Because of the pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaption, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.

We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.MethodsWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.FindingsUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.InterpretationThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.FundingUK Medical Research Council.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, SSRN, Research Square, Virological, and Wellcome Open Research for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the search terms “coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, and similar terms, and “fatality”, up to March 6, 2020. Several studies have estimated the case fatality ratio (the percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed disease who die from the disease) and infection fatality ratio (the percentage of all infected individuals who die from the disease, including those with mild disease) of COVID-19 using a range of different statistical and modelling methods. Studies done solely in hospitalised patients report the highest fatality ratios (8–28%), representing the outcome for the most severely ill patients. Estimates of the population-level case fatality ratio from all case reports are in the range of 2–8%. Estimates of the infection fatality ratio averaged across all age-groups range from 0·2% to 1·6%, while estimates of the infection fatality ratio in the oldest age group (≥80 years) range from 8% to 36%. None of the identified studies had adjusted for differences in the denominator populations to obtain estimates that could be applied across populations. No other studies have estimated the proportion of infected individuals who will require hospitalisation.Added value of this studyBy synthesising data from across a range of surveillance settings, we obtained estimates of the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio that take into account the different denominator populations in the datasets. Our underlying assumption, that attack rates (ie, the probability of becoming infected) do not vary substantially by age, is consistent with previous studies for respiratory infections. Under this assumption, differences in age patterns among cases in Wuhan versus those elsewhere in China would probably due to under-ascertainment of cases, given the different surveillance systems in place. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis, with cases in Wuhan seen in older individuals, who would have been identified through attendance at hospital, whereas cases elsewhere in China being younger overall, which would be explained by the policy of testing those with a travel history to Wuhan. After correcting for these biases, we found that estimates of the case fatality ratio from China are consistent with those obtained from early international cases. Our age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio can be applied to any demography to give an estimate of the infection fatality ratio in older and younger populations. These estimates can be combined with estimates of the infection attack rate (approximately 80% for an unmitigated epidemic) to give rough projections of scale. Similarly, our estimates of the proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation can be combined with the infection attack rate to forecast health-care requirements.Implications of all the available evidenceOur estimates of the case fatality ratio for COVID-19, although lower than some of the crude estimates made to date, are substantially higher than for recent influenza pandemics (eg, H1N1 influenza in 2009). With the rapid geographical spread observed to date, COVID-19 therefore represents a major global health threat in the coming weeks and months. Our estimate of the proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation, when combined with likely infection attack rates (around 50–80%), show that even the most advanced health-care systems are likely to be overwhelmed. These estimates are therefore crucial to enable countries around the world to best prepare as the global pandemic continues to unfold.

Assessing the severity of COVID-19 is crucial to determine the appropriateness of mitigation strategies and to enable planning for health-care needs as epidemics unfold. However, crude case fatality ratios obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases can be misleading.9Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar,  10Lipsitch M Donnelly CA Fraser C et al.Potential biases in estimating absolute and relative case-fatality risks during outbreaks.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015; 9e0003846Google Scholar First, there can be a period of 2–3 weeks between a person developing symptoms, the case subsequently being detected and reported, and observation of the final clinical outcome. During a growing epidemic, the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown. Simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true case fatality ratio early in an epidemic.9Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar,  10Lipsitch M Donnelly CA Fraser C et al.Potential biases in estimating absolute and relative case-fatality risks during outbreaks.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015; 9e0003846Google Scholar,  11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Google Scholar This effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)12Donnelly CA Ghani AC Leung GM et al.Epidemiological determinants of spread of causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1761-1766Google Scholar and H1N19Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar influenza, and as such is widely recognised. Thus, many of the estimates of the case fatality ratio that have been obtained to date for COVID-19 correct for this effect.13Jung S Akhmetzhanov AR Hayashi K et al.Real-time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: inference using exported cases.J Clin Med. 2020; 9: E523Google Scholar,  14Mizumoto K Kagaya K Chowell G Yoshida-Nakaadachi-cho U Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan City: China, January–February, 2020.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 13.)

Ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated case fatality ratio downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic. Second, surveillance of a newly emerged pathogen is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases, especially at the start of an epidemic when diagnostic capacity is low (figure 1). Estimates of the case fatality ratio can thus be biased upwards until the extent of clinically milder disease is determined.9Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar Data from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan have primarily been obtained through hospital surveillance and, thus, are likely to represent patients with moderate or severe illness, with atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress being used to define suspected cases eligible for testing.7Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology TeamThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China.Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020; 41 (in Chinese).: 145-151Google Scholar In these individuals, clinical outcomes are likely to be more severe, so any estimates of the case fatality ratio will be higher. Elsewhere in mainland China and the rest of the world, countries and administrative regions alert to the risk of infection being imported via travel initially instituted surveillance for COVID-19 with a broader set of clinical criteria for defining a suspected case. These criteria typically included a combination of symptoms (eg, cough and fever) combined with recent travel history to the affected region (Wuhan, or Hubei province)2Chan JFW Yuan S Kok KH et al.A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster.Lancet. 2020; 395: 514-523Google Scholar,  17Xu XW Wu XX Jiang XG et al.Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series.BMJ. 2020; 368: m606Google Scholar. Such surveillance is likely to detect clinically mild cases but, by initially restricting testing to those with a travel history or link, might have missed other symptomatic cases.Figure 1Spectrum of COVID-19 casesShow full captionAt the top of the pyramid, those meeting the WHO case criteria for severe or critical cases are likely to be identified in the hospital setting, presenting with atypical viral pneumonia.

Many more cases are likely to be symptomatic (ie, with fever, cough, or myalgia), but might not require hospitalisation. These cases will have been identified through links to international travel to high-risk areas and through contact-tracing of contacts of confirmed cases.

They might also be identified through population surveillance of, for example, influenza-like illness. The bottom part of the pyramid represents mild (and possibly asymptomatic) cases. These cases might be identified through contact tracing and subsequently via serological testing. Here we attempt to adjust for these biases in data sources to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio (proportion of all cases that will eventually lead to death) and infection fatality ratio (the proportion of all infections that will eventually lead to death) using both individual-level case report data and aggregate case and death counts from mainland China, from Hong Kong and Macau, and international case reports. By adjusting for both underlying demography and potential under-ascertainment at different levels of the severity pyramid (figure 1), these estimates should be broadly applicable across a range of settings to inform health planning while more detailed case data accrue. We identified information on the characteristics of 48 patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, reported by the National Health Commission and the Hubei Province Health Commission website up to Feb 8, 2020. We recorded the following data elements, where available: sex, age, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, and date of death. Of the 48 cases, neither the date of symptom onset nor the date of report was available for 13 cases. We also removed eight cases with onset before Jan 1, 2020, or death before Jan 21, 2020, and three deaths after Jan 28, 2020, which were the dates consistent with reliable reporting of onset and death in this setting, respectively, considering the onset-to-death times (including early onsets creates a bias towards long onset-to-death times, reflecting under-ascertainment of deaths early on). This left 24 deaths, which we used to estimate the onset-to-death distribution. We collated data on 2010 cases reported in 37 countries and two special administrative regions of China (Hong Kong and Macau), from government or ministry of health websites and media reports, until Feb 25, 2020. We recorded the following information where available: country or administrative region in which the case was detected, whether the infection was acquired in China or abroad, date of travel, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, date of confirmation, date of recovery, and date of death. We used data from 165 recovered individuals with reported recovery dates and reported or imputed onset dates to estimate the onset-to-recovery distribution, after excluding 26 recoveries without appropriate information on dates of recovery, report, or locality.

Data on infection prevalence in repatriated expatriates returning to their home countries were obtained from government or ministry of health websites and media reports. To match to the incidence reported in Wuhan on Jan 30, 2020, we used data from six flights that departed between Jan 30 and Feb 1, 2020, inclusive. In early February 2020 a cruise liner named the Diamond Princess was quarantined after a disembarked passenger tested positive for the virus. Subsequently all 3711 passengers on board were tested over the next month. We extracted data on the ages of passengers onboard on Feb 5, 2020, the dates of positive test reports, which were available for 657 out of 712 PCR-confirmed cases, and the dates of ten deaths among these cases from the reports of the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare19Government of JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare.https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e.htmlDate: 2020Date accessed: March 26, 2020Google Scholar and international media.

In estimating time intervals between symptom onset and outcome, it was necessary to account for the fact that, during a growing epidemic, a higher proportion of the cases will have been infected recently (appendix p 7). Therefore, we re-parameterised a gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 0·14 per day, obtained from the early case onset data (appendix p 6). Using Bayesian methods, we fitted gamma distributions to the data on time from onset to death and onset to recovery, conditional on having observed the final outcome. Missing onset dates were imputed on the basis of dates of report, where available. Estimates of the distribution of times from onset-to-death were used to project the expected cumulative number of deaths given the onsets observed in Wuhan and outside Wuhan, assuming a uniform attack rate across age groups. Using the age-distribution of the population, we obtained an estimate of the expected number of infections in each age group. Under-ascertainment was estimated in and outside of Wuhan by comparing the number of observed cases by age to this expected distribution, assuming perfect ascertainment in the 50–59 age group as this group had the highest number of detected cases relative to population size. We also did a sensitivity analysis assuming a differential attack rate by age (appendix p 9). For Wuhan, we added scaling to account for further under-ascertainment compared with outside of Wuhan. These steps gave us the expected age-distribution of cases. For a given onset-to-death distribution, we obtained a modelled estimate of the cumulative number of deaths by age under an age-dependent case fatality ratio (fitted relative to the case fatality ratio in the oldest age group, which represented the highest crude case fatality ratio). This estimate was compared with the observed deaths by age using a Poisson likelihood. These data were then jointly fitted alongside the most recent age-aggregated cumulative deaths and cases in mainland China. Given that the numbers of observed cases and deaths have dropped substantially following a peak in late January, the ratio of current cumulative cases to current number of deaths, once corrected for under-ascertainment, should provide a good estimate of the final case fatality ratio.11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Google Scholar To estimate the infection fatality ratio we fitted to data on infection prevalence from international Wuhan residents who were repatriated to their home countries. Our age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio model was jointly fitted to the case data and infection prevalence data with use of Bayesian methods, using our previous estimate of the onset-to-death distribution as a prior. Full mathematical details are provided in the appendix (p 8). Assuming a uniform attack rate by age groups, we used the demography-adjusted under-ascertainment rates calculated above to obtain an estimate of the proportion of infected individuals who would require hospitalisation. To independently validate our infection fatality ratio estimate, we analysed data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise liner taking the dates of reported positive tests as a proxy for onset date. We calculated the expected proportion of deaths observed until March 25, 2020, given the onset times and estimated onset-to-death distribution (appendix p 13). We used parametric and non-parametric methods11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Google Scholar,  22Griffin J Ghani A CASEFAT: Stata module for estimating the case fatality ratio of a new infectious disease.

Cases in which the outcome was unknown were treated as censored observations. For parametric and non-parametric analyses, missing onset dates were multiply imputed using information on the onset-to-report distribution, and unreported recoveries were imputed using onset-to-outcome distributions and country summary data. The parametric models were fitted to the data using Bayesian methods (appendix p 12). The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. In the subset of 24 deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in mainland China early in the epidemic, with correction for bias introduced by the growth of the epidemic, we estimated the mean time from onset to death to be 18·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 15·7–49·7; figure 2) with a coefficient of variation of 0·45 (95% CrI 0·29–0·54). With the small number of observations in these data and given that they were from early in the epidemic, we could not rule out many deaths occurring with longer times from onset to death, hence the high upper limit of the credible interval. However, given that the epidemic in China has since declined, our posterior estimate of the mean time from onset to death, informed by the analysis of aggregated data from China, is more precise (mean 17·8 days [16·9–19·2]; figure 2).Figure 2Onset-to-death and onset-to-recovery distributionsShow full caption(A) Onset-to-death data from 24 cases in mainland China early in the epidemic.

Both these onset-to-outcome estimates are consistent with a separate study in China.23Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020;  (published online March 11.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3Google Scholar Case fatality ratios were estimated from aggregate data on cases and deaths in mainland China (table 1). A large proportion of the cases, including all of those early in the epidemic, were reported in Wuhan, where the local health system was quickly overwhelmed. As a result, the age distribution of cases reported in Wuhan differed to that in the rest of China (figure 3A). Reported cases in Wuhan were more frequent in older age groups, perhaps reflecting higher severity (and therefore prioritisation for hospitalisation in Wuhan), while cases outside of Wuhan might also show a bias in terms of the relationship between age and travel. Adjusting for differences in underlying demography and assuming no overall difference in the attack rate by age, we estimated high under-ascertainment of cases in younger age groups both inside and outside of Wuhan (figure 3C, D). Furthermore, we estimated a higher level of under-ascertainment overall in Wuhan compared with outside of Wuhan (figure 3C). Accounting for this under-ascertainment, we estimated the highest case fatality ratio (13·4% [11·2–15·9%]) in the 80 years and older age group (figure 3B, table 1), with lower case fatality ratios associated with lower age groups, and the lowest in the 0–9 years age group (0·00260% [0·000312–0·0382]).Table 1Estimates of case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio obtained from aggregate time series of cases in mainland ChinaDeathsLaboratory-confirmed cases** Values do not include the clinically diagnosed cases included in our estimates.Case fatality ratioInfection fatality ratio†† Obtained by combining estimates of case fatality ratios with information on infection prevalence obtained from those returning home on repatriation flights.CrudeAdjusted for censoringAdjusted for censoring, demography, and under-ascertainment‡‡ Accounts for the underlying demography in Wuhan and elsewhere in China and corrects for under-ascertainment.Overall102344 6722·29% (2·15–2·43)3·67% (3·56–3·80)1·38% (1·23–1·53)0·657% (0·389–1·33)Age group, years0–904160·000% (0·000–0·883)0·0954% (0·0110–1·34)0·00260% (0·000312–0·0382)0·00161% (0·000185–0·0249)10–1915490·182% (0·00461–1·01)0·352% (0·0663–1·74)0·0148% (0·00288–0·0759)0·00695% (0·00149–0·0502)20–29736190·193% (0·0778–0·398)0·296% (0·158–0·662)0·0600% (0·0317–0·132)0·0309% (0·0138–0·0923)30–391876000·237% (0·140–0·374)0·348% (0·241–0·577)0·146% (0·103–0·255)0·0844% (0·0408–0·185)40–493885710·443% (0·314–0·608)0·711% (0·521–0·966)0·295% (0·221–0·422)0·161% (0·0764–0·323)50–5913010 0081·30% (1·09–1·54)2·06% (1·74–2·43)1·25% (1·03–1·55)0·595% (0·344–1·28)60–6930985833·60% (3·22–4·02)5·79% (5·20–6·34)3·99% (3·41–4·55)1·93% (1·11–3·89)70–7931239187·96% (7·13–8·86)12·7% (11·5–13·9)8·61% (7·48–9·99)4·28% (2·45–8·44)≥80208140814·8% (13·0–16·7)23·3% (20·3–26·7)13·4% (11·2–15·9)7·80% (3·80–13·3)Age category (binary), years<6019430 7630·631% (0·545–0·726)1·01% (0·900–1·17)0·318% (0·274–0·378)0·145% (0·0883–0·317)≥6082913 9095·96% (5·57–6·37)9·49% (9·11–9·95)6·38% (5·70–7·17)3·28% (1·82–6·18)Crude case fatality ratios are presented as mean (95% confidence interval).

In international Wuhan residents repatriated on six flights, we estimated a prevalence of infection of 0·87% (95% CI 0·32–1·9; six of 689). Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we estimate an infection fatality ratio of 0·66% (95% CrI 0·39–1·33). As for the case fatality ratio, this is strongly age-dependent, with estimates rising steeply from age 50 years upwards (table 1). The demography-adjusted and under-ascertainment-adjusted proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation ranges from 1·1% in the 20–29 years age group up to 18·4% in those 80 years and older (table 3). Using these age-stratified infection fatality ratio estimates, we estimate the infection fatality ratio in the Diamond Princess population to be 2·9%. Given the delay from onset of symptoms to death, we would expect 97% of these deaths to have occurred by March 25, 2020, giving an estimate of the current infection fatality ratio of 2·8%, compared with the empirical estimate of 1·4% (95% CI 0·7–2·6; ten of 712).Table 3Estimates of the proportion of all infections that would lead to hospitalisation, obtained from a subset of cases reported in mainland China18Yang Y Lu Q Liu M et al.Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online Feb 21.)

From an extensive analysis of data from different regions of the world, our best estimate at the current time for the case fatality ratio of COVID-19 in China is 1·38% (95% CrI 1·23–1·53).

This value was consistent with the infection fatality ratio observed in passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship up to March 5, 2020, although it is slightly above the upper 95% confidence limit of the age-adjusted infection fatality ratio observed by March 25 (of 712 confirmed cases, 601 have been discharged, ten have died, and 11 remain in a critical condition). This difference might be due to repatriation flight data slightly underestimating milder infections, or due to cruise passengers having better outcomes because of a potentially higher-than-average quality of health care. Our estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases require hospitalisation. This assumption is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in China, where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation. Mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations, given that the risks associated with COVID-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying comorbidities. Our estimate of the case fatality ratio is substantially lower than the crude case fatality ratio obtained from China based on the cases and deaths observed to date, which is currently 3·67%, as well as many of the estimates currently in the literature. The principle reason for this difference is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases. For example, various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms (for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history)13Jung S Akhmetzhanov AR Hayashi K et al.Real-time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: inference using exported cases.J Clin Med. 2020; 9: E523Google Scholar through to those identified in the hospital setting.14Mizumoto K Kagaya K Chowell G Yoshida-Nakaadachi-cho U Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan City: China, January–February, 2020.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 13.)

Our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20 years. As there are very few cases in this age group, it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility, although early results indicate young people are not at lower risk of infection than adults.28Bi Q Wu Y Mei S et al.Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 19.) (preprint).DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423Google Scholar Serological testing in this age group will be crucial in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age group in driving population transmission. The estimated increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case reports, in which the mean age tends to be in the range of 50–60 years. Different surveillance systems will pick up a different age case mix, and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through a history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance. Our correction for this surveillance bias therefore allows us to obtain estimates that can be applied to different case mixes and demographic population structures. However, it should be noted that this correction is applicable under the assumption of a uniform infection attack rate (ie, exposure) across the population. We also assumed perfect case ascertainment outside of Wuhan in the age group with the most cases relative to their population size (50–59-year-olds); however, if many cases were missed, the case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio estimates might be lower. In the absence of random population surveys of infection prevalence, our adjustment from case fatality ratio to infection fatality ratio relied on repatriation flight data, which was not age specific. The reported proportion of infected individuals who were asymptomatic on the Diamond Princess did not vary considerably by age, supporting this approach, but future larger representative population prevalence surveys and seroprevalence surveys will inform such estimates further. Much of the data informing global estimates of the case fatality ratio at present are from the early outbreak in Wuhan. Given that the health system in this city was quickly overwhelmed, our estimates suggest that there is substantial under-ascertainment of cases in the younger age groups (who we estimate to have milder disease) by comparison with elsewhere in mainland China. This under-ascertainment is the main factor driving the difference between our estimate of the crude case fatality ratio from China (3·67%) and our best estimate of the overall case fatality ratio (1·38%). The case fatality ratio is likely to be strongly influenced by the availability of health-care facilities. However surprisingly, although health-care availability in Wuhan was stretched, our estimates from international cases are of a similar magnitude, suggesting relatively little difference in health outcome. Finally, as clinical knowledge of this new disease accrues, it is possible that outcomes will improve. It will therefore be important to revise these estimates as epidemics unfold. The world is currently experiencing the early stages of a global pandemic. Although China has succeeded in containing the disease spread for 2 months, such containment is unlikely to be achievable in most countries. Thus, much of the world will experience very large community epidemics of COVID-19 over the coming weeks and months. Our estimates of the underlying infection fatality ratio of this virus will inform assessments of health effects likely to be experienced in different countries, and thus decisions around appropriate mitigation policies to be adopted.

We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.FindingsCases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%).

If well tracked, early introductions of an emerging pathogen provide a unique opportunity to characterise its transmission, natural history, and the effectiveness of screening. Careful monitoring of cases and low probability of infection from the general community enables inferences, important to modelling the course of the outbreak, that are difficult to make during a widely disseminated epidemic. In particular, we can make assumptions about when and where cases were likely to have been infected that are impossible when the pathogen is widespread. Furthermore, during these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing important information about transmission and natural history. Combined, these data on early introductions can be used to give insights into the natural history of the disease,9Lessler J Reich NG Cummings DAT Nair HP Jordan HT Thompson N Outbreak of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) at a New York City school.N Engl J Med. 2009; 361: 2628-2636CrossrefPubMedScopus (227)Google Scholar transmission characteristics,10Lipsitch M Cohen T Cooper B et al.Transmission dynamics and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome.Science. 2003; 300: 1966-1970CrossrefPubMedScopus (652)Google Scholar and the unseen burden of infection.11Lessler J Salje H Van Kerkhove MD et al.Estimating the severity and subclinical burden of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Am J Epidemiol. 2016; 183: 657-663CrossrefPubMedScopus (19)Google Scholar Research in contextEvidence before this studyThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been accompanied by a substantial increase in research and publications ranging from transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 to clinical characteristics of the infection.

We present one of the first estimates of the serial interval, secondary household attack rate, and dispersion (ie, tendency towards super spreading) for SARS-CoV-2 based on active surveillance data. We found that the attack rate does not differ significantly by age, with on average 7% of close contacts becoming infected, around 80% of these contacts showing any symptoms, and 3% of infections manifesting severe disease at initial assessment.

We provide a key piece of evidence supporting intensive contact tracing and highlighting that children might be an important target for interventions aimed at reducing transmission, even if they do not get sick. Here, we use data collected by the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Shenzhen CDC) on 391 cases of COVID-19 and 1286 of their close contacts to characterise key aspects of its epidemiology outside of Hubei province. We characterise differences in demographics and severity between cases identified through symptom-based surveillance and monitoring of close case contacts, and estimate the time to key events, such as confirmation, isolation, and recovery. Using data from contact tracing, we characterise SARS-CoV-2 transmission by estimating key values, such as the household secondary attack rate, serial interval, and observed reproductive number (R). On Jan 8, 2020, Shenzhen CDC identified the first case of pneumonia with unknown cause and began monitoring travellers from Hubei province for symptoms of COVID-19. Over the next 2 weeks this surveillance programme expanded to include travellers from Hubei regardless of symptoms, patients at local hospitals, and individuals detected by fever screening in neighbourhoods and at local clinics. Suspected cases and close contacts were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of nasal swabs at 28 qualified local hospitals, ten district-level CDCs, and two third-party testing organisations, with final confirmation done at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangdong CDC) or Shenzhen CDC (appendix 2 p 11). Close contacts were identified through contact tracing of a confirmed case and were defined as those who lived in the same apartment, shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with an index case 2 days before symptom onset. Casual contacts (eg, other clinic patients) and some close contacts (eg, nurses) who wore a mask during exposure were not included in this group. Symptomatic cases were isolated and treated at designated hospitals regardless of RT-PCR test results. Asymptomatic individuals who tested positive were quarantined at centralised facilities. Close contacts and travellers from Hubei who tested negative were quarantined at home or a central facility, and monitored for 14 days. RT-PCR testing was required for all close contacts at the beginning of isolation, and release was conditional on a negative RT-PCR result. Basic demographics, signs and symptoms, clinical severity, and exposure history were recorded for all confirmed cases. Here, we analyse confirmed cases identified by the Shenzhen CDC between Jan 14 and Feb 12, 2020, and close contacts of cases confirmed before Feb 9, 2020. This work was done in support of an ongoing public health response, and hence was determined not to be human subjects research after consultation with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health institutional review board. Data collection is part of the continuing public health investigation of an emerging outbreak and therefore the individual informed consent was waived. The study was approved by the ethics committees of Shenzhen CDC. Analytical datasets were constructed in an anonymised manner, and all analysis of personally identifiable data took place onsite at the Shenzhen CDC. We defined symptom-based surveillance to include symptomatic screening at airport and train stations, community fever monitoring, home observation of recent travellers to Hubei, and testing of patients admitted to hospital. Contact-based surveillance is the identification of cases through monitoring and testing of close contacts of confirmed cases, independently of their symptom presentation. By protocol, those in the contact-based group were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of symptoms, whereas those in the other categories were tested only if they showed signs or symptoms of disease. At the first clinical assessment, data were recorded on 21 signs and symptoms (appendix 2 p 1), and disease severity was assessed. Cases with fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia were classified as having moderate symptoms. Cases were classified as having severe symptoms if they had any of the following: breathing rate 30 breaths per min or higher; oxygen saturation level 93% or lower at rest; oxygen concentration level PaO2/FiO2 (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen) 300 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0·133 kPa) or lower; lung infiltrates higher than 50% within 24–48 h; respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; septic shock; or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. All other symptomatic cases were classified as mild. Relationships between demographics, mode of detection, and symptom severity were assessed and characterised with χ2 tests, and simple and multiple logistic regression. Distributions were fit to the timing of key events in each confirmed case's course of infection and treatment. The time from infection to symptom onset (incubation period) was assumed to be log-normally distributed and estimated as previously described.12Reich NG Lessler J Azman A Kamvar ZN Analysis of coarsely observed data [R package coarseDataTools version 0·6–5].

Cases who recently travelled to Hubei were assumed to have been exposed while there. Cases without a recent travel history but with exposure to a confirmed case were assumed to be exposed from the time of earliest to latest possible contact with that case. Only cases for whom we could identify the earliest and latest possible time of exposure and who had a date of symptom onset were included in the analysis. Time between symptom onset and recovery was estimated by use of parametric survival methods. Patients who had not recovered were considered to be censored on Feb 22, 2020, or at the time of death. All other delay distributions were estimated by directly fitting parametric distributions to time between symptom onset or arrival in Shenzhen, and confirmation, isolation, or admission to hospital. Confidence intervals were calculated with bootstrapping or standard parametric estimators.15Efron B Gong G A leisurely look at the bootstrap, the jackknife, and cross-validation.Am Stat. 1983; 37: 36-48Google Scholar Transmission was characterised by examining the relationship between confirmed cases and their infected and uninfected close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was calculated as the percentage of household contacts (those sharing a room, apartment, or other sleeping arrangement) who were later confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The distribution of serial intervals (the time between symptom onset in the confirmed case and their infected contacts) was calculated by fitting parametric distributions to the time of symptom onset in clear case–contact pairs. The mean R and distribution of individual reproductive numbers (ie, the number of secondary infections caused by each case) were calculated from the number of secondary infections observed among close contacts of each index case, with ambiguities resolved through multiple imputation (appendix 2 p 11). The relative odds of transmission among contacts of various types were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression and random-effects models, to account for differing numbers of possible infected individuals in each risk group. When assessing the impact of characteristics of infected individuals, we only included risk sets where a single potential infected individual was clearly identifiable. Confidence intervals were estimated by use of bootstrapping or standard parametric approaches. The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Shenzhen CDC had full access to all the data in the study, and all corresponding authors share the final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Between Jan 14 and Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen CDC confirmed 391 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (table 1). Of 379 with a known mode of detection, 292 (77%) were detected through symptom-based surveillance. Overall, there were approximately equal numbers of male and female cases (187 vs 204). The mean age of the population was 45 years, and 307 (79%) of 391 cases were adults aged 30–69 years. At the time of first clinical assessment, most cases were mild (102 [26%] of 391) or moderate (254 [65%] of 391), and only 35 (9%) were severe. 330 (84%) of 391 cases had fever at the time of initial assessment, while 25 (6%) of 391 had no signs or symptoms. As of Feb 22, 2020, final clinical outcomes were known for 228 of 391 cases in our data, with three who had died (all captured through symptom-based surveillance) and 225 who had recovered.Table 1Demographic and clinical characteristics of cases by contact-based versus symptom-based surveillanceContact-based surveillance (n=87)Symptom-based surveillance (n=292)Unknown or other (n=12)Total (n=391)p valueSexFemale63 (72%)131 (45%)10 (83%)204 (52%)<0·0001Male24 (28%)161 (55%)2 (17%)187 (48%)..Age0–9 years13 (15%)6 (2%)1 (8%)20 (5%)<0·000110–19 years5 (6%)6 (2%)1 (8%)12 (3%)..20–29 years11 (13%)23 (8%)0 (0%)34 (9%)..30–39 years15 (17%)71 (24%)1 (8%)87 (22%)..40–49 years9 (10%)49 (17%)2 (17%)60 (15%)..50–59 years10 (12%)63 (22%)1 (8%)74 (19%)..60–69 years20 (23%)60 (21%)6 (50%)86 (22%)..≥70 years4 (5%)14 (5%)0 (0%)18 (5%)..SeverityMild18 (21%)82 (28%)2 (17%)102 (26%)0·03Moderate66 (76%)180 (62%)8 (67%)254 (65%)..Severe3 (3%)30 (10%)2 (17%)35 (9%)..SymptomaticNo17 (20%)8 (3%)0 (0%)25 (6%)<0·0001Yes70 (80%)284 (97%)12 (100%)366 (94%)..FeverNo25 (29%)34 (12%)2 (17%)61 (16%)0·0002Yes62 (71%)258 (88%)10 (83%)330 (84%)..

The probability of severe symptoms increased slightly with age, although only individuals aged 60–69 years had a significantly increased risk compared with the reference category, individuals aged 50–59 years (OR 3·4 [95% 1·4–9·5]). Based on 183 cases with a well defined period of exposure and symptom onset (appendix 2 p 8), we estimated the median incubation period for COVID-19 to be 4·8 days (95% CI 4·2–5·4; figure 1, appendix 2 p 2), and estimated that 95% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 14·0 days (95% CI 12·2–15·9) of infection. We estimated that about 5·0% of cases who develop symptoms would not show symptoms until 14 days after infection.Figure 1Incubation period and serial interval of COVID-19Show full caption(A) Proportion of cases who developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by days after infection (ie, the cumulative distribution function of the incubation period).

Based on 228 cases with known outcomes, we estimated that median time to recovery was 20·8 days (95% CI 20·1–21·5). We estimated that the median time to recovery was 22·4 days (95% CI 20·8–24·1) in individuals aged 50–59 years, and was estimated to be significantly shorter in younger adults (eg, 19·2 days in individuals aged 20–29 years; appendix 2 pp 3, 10). In multiple regression models including sex, age, baseline severity, and method of detection, in addition to age, baseline severity was associated with time to recovery (appendix 2 p 3). Compared to cases with mild symptoms, those with severe symptoms had a 41% (95% CI 24–60) longer time to recovery (appendix 2 p 3). As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died. These deaths occurred 35–44 days from symptom onset and 27–33 days from confirmation. Cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were confirmed on average 5·5 days (95% CI 5·0–5·9) after symptom onset (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2), whereas those detected by contact-based surveillance were confirmed on average 3·2 days (95% CI 2·7–3·8) after symptom onset. 17 (5%) of 342 cases with a known onset date and start date of quarantine were isolated before developing symptoms. Among those isolated after developing symptoms, the symptom-based surveillance group was, on average, isolated 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after symptom onset, whereas the contact-based surveillance group was isolated 2·7 days (2·1–3·3) after symptom onset. Hence, contact-based surveillance was associated with a 2·3-day (95% CI 1·5–3·0) decrease in time to confirmation and a 1·9-day (1·1–2·7) decrease in time to isolation. The mean time between symptom onset and admission to hospital was similar to time between symptom onset and isolation in both the symptom-based and contact-based surveillance groups (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2).Figure 2Time between symptom onset and SARS-CoV-2 confirmation (A), admission to hospital (B), and isolation among cases (C) detected by contact-based and symptom-based surveillanceShow full captionThe maximum-likelihood estimates for the parametric distribution of the cumulative distribution function are shown, along with 1000 parametric bootstrap estimates of the cumulative distribution function.

Those developing symptoms before arrival or on the day of arrival were confirmed as cases on average 4·5 days (95% CI 3·8–5·1) after arrival, and isolated on average 3·1 days (2·5–3·7) after arrival. Overall, 1286 close contacts were identified for index cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 14 and Feb 9, 2020, with 244 (84%) of 292 cases having at least one close contact. 622 (95%) of 653 close contacts with known dates for the period when they were under quarantine were followed up for 12 days or longer. 98 of the close contacts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, and one had presumptive infection. Assuming those with a missing test result were uninfected, we found that the secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8) among household contacts and 6·6% (5·4–8·1) overall (the secondary attack rate increased to 14·9% [12·1–18·2] among household contacts and 9·7% [7·9–11·8] overall if those with missing results were removed from the denominator). In multiple conditional logistic regression analysis of contact types, household contact (OR 6·3; 95% CI 1·5–26·3) and travelling together (OR 7·1; 1·4–34·9) were significantly associated with infection (table 3). Reporting contact that occurred often was also associated with increased risk of infection compared with moderate-frequency contact (OR 8·8; 95% CI 2·6–30·1; table 3).Table 3Group-specific attack rates and risk factors for SAR-CoV-2 infection among close contactsNumber of cases** 15 confirmed close contacts were excluded from this analysis because contact tracing reports for the negative close contacts in the same clusters were missing.

Attack rates were similar across all age categories of infected contacts (table 3), although we observed some indication of elevated attack rates in older age groups (figure 3). Notably, the rate of infection in children younger than 10 years (7·4%) was similar to the population average (6·6%). There was no significant association between probability of infection and age of the index case. Surprisingly, in univariate analysis a longer time in the community before isolation was associated with a reduced risk of causing infections (data not shown). However, this association was no longer significant after adjusting for contact frequency and type.Figure 3Attack rate among close contacts, baseline severity, and proportion of cases without fever at initial assessment by age groupShow full caption*Proportion of close contacts for attack rate; proportion of all cases for those with severe symptoms or no fever at initial assessment.View Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) *Proportion of close contacts for attack rate; proportion of all cases for those with severe symptoms or no fever at initial assessment. Based on 48 pairs of cases with a clear relationship between the index case and secondary case and time of symptom onset, we estimated that the serial interval is gamma distributed with a mean of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6) and an SD of 4·2 days (95% CI 3·1–5·3; figure 1B, appendix 2 p 2). Hence, 95% of secondary cases were expected to develop symptoms within 14·3 days (95% CI 11·1–17·6) of their infector. This estimate includes the effect of isolation on truncating the serial interval. Stratified results show that if the infected individual was isolated less than 3 days after infection the average serial interval was 3·6 days, increasing to 8·1 days if the infected individual was isolated on the third day after symptom onset or later (appendix 2 p 3). The mean number of secondary cases caused by each index case (ie, the observed reproductive number, R), was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5). The distribution of individual R values was highly over-dispersed, with 80% of infections being caused by 8·9% (95% CI 3·5–10·8) of cases (negative binomial dispersion parameter 0·58; 95% CI 0·35–1·18). We examined the potential impact of surveillance and isolation through truncating the infectious period. Because of the scarce understanding of infectious periods following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we considered a range of possible infectious periods where infectiousness varies over time and follows a gamma distribution (appendix 2 p 11). We defined the mean infectious day (ie, the average number of days after symptom onset that an infected individual is expected to infect a secondary case) as the weighted mean of the infectious period, where each day is weighted by relative infectiousness. We considered periods where the mean infectious day is less than 15 days after symptom onset (roughly the period of SARS and early SARS-CoV-2 reports),16Peiris JSM Chu CM Cheng VCC et al.Clinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1767-1772SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (1025)Google Scholar,  17Zou L Ruan F Huang M et al.SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 1177-1179CrossrefPubMedScopus (129)Google Scholar and assumed that R0=2·6 and that isolation effectively ends the infectious period. Under these assumptions we found that if the mean infectious day is greater than 5 days, then it might be possible to bring R below one in cases detected by symptom-based surveillance, and the same can be accomplished by contact-based surveillance if the mean infectious day is greater than 3 days (appendix 2 p 9). For the impact of passive surveillance alone to achieve our observed R of 0·4, we projected that the mean infectious day must be at least 5·5 days (and likely greater) after symptom onset. Even if transmission is completely eliminated in the group captured by surveillance (eg, if we could get perfect surveillance on the day of symptom onset), assuming R0=2·6, the cases captured by surveillance must, if not isolated, be expected to cause 61% of onward transmission to achieve local elimination by surveillance and isolation alone (appendix 2 p 9). This analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 cases and their close contacts in Shenzhen, China, provides insight into the natural history, transmission, and control of this disease. The values estimated provide the evidentiary foundation for predicting the impact of this virus, evaluating control measures, and guiding the global response. Analyses of how cases are detected, and use of data on individuals exposed but not infected, indicate that infection rates in young children are not lower than the population average (even if rates of clinical disease are). We were able to directly estimate important transmission parameters, and show that, at least among observed contacts, transmission rates are low. Estimates of the distribution of time between symptom onset and case isolation by surveillance type reveal that heightened surveillance combined with case isolation could plausibly account for these low rates of transmission. These results paint a positive picture of the impact of heightened surveillance and isolation in Shenzhen. However, uncertainty in the number of asymptomatic cases missed by surveillance and their ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 must temper any hopes of stopping the COVID-19 pandemic by these measures. This work further supports the understanding of COVID-19 as a disease with a fairly short incubation period (mean 4–6 days) but a long clinical course,2Chen N Zhou M Dong X et al.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 507-513SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (559)Google Scholar,  7Backer JA Klinkenberg D Wallinga J Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20–28 January 2020.Euro Surveill. 2020; 252000062CrossrefScopus (49)Google Scholar,  18Pan F Ye T Sun P et al.Time course of lung changes on chest CT during recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia.Radiology. 2020;  (published online Feb 13.)DOI:10.1148/radiol.2020200370CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar with patients taking many weeks to die or recover. Notably, however, we estimate a higher proportion of cases taking 14 days or more to develop symptoms (5%) than estimated in the study by Lauer and colleagues (1%).6Lauer SA Grantz KH Bi Q et al.The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application.Ann Int Med. 2020;  (published online March 10)DOI: 10.7326/M20-0504CrossrefPubMedScopus (56)Google Scholar Focusing on cases detected through contact-based surveillance adds nuance to previous characterisations of COVID-19. Since RT-PCR testing of contacts is near universal, we can assume these cases are more reflective of the average SARS-CoV-2 infection than cases detected through symptomatic surveillance. In the contact-based surveillance group, any tendency for cases to be male or older (beyond the underlying population distribution) disappears. Furthermore, in this group, 20% of cases were asymptomatic at the time of first clinical assessment and nearly 30% did not have a fever. This observation is consistent with a reasonably high rate of asymptomatic carriage, but lower than that suggested by some modelling studies,19Imai N Cori A Dorigatti I Baguelin M Donnelly CA Riley S Ferguson NM Report 3: transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-transmissibility-25-01-2020.pdfDate: Jan 25, 2020Date accessed: February 24, 2020Google Scholar although RT-PCR has imperfect sensitivity.20Fang Y Zhang H Xie J et al.Sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19: comparison to RT-PCR.Radiology. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1148/radiol.2020200432CrossrefGoogle Scholar In Shenzhen, SARS-CoV-2 transmission most probably occurred between very close contacts, such as individuals sharing a household. However, even in this group fewer than one in six contacts (ie, secondary attack rate 11–15%) were infected, and overall we observed far fewer than one (0·4) onward transmission per primary case. As noted above, low transmission levels might in part be due to the impact of isolation and surveillance, but it is equally likely that unobserved transmission has some role. We also estimated reasonably high rates of overdispersion in the number of cases caused by each infected individual, leaving open the possibility that large COVID-19 clusters can occur even if surveillance and isolation are forcing R below one—events that could potentially overwhelm the surveillance system. This work has numerous limitations. As in any active outbreak response, the data were collected by multiple teams under protocols that, by necessity, changed as the situation developed. Hence, there might be noise and inconsistency in definitions. Notably, the definition of a confirmed case changed to require symptoms near the end of our analysis period (Feb 7), but sensitivity analyses show that truncating the data at this point does not qualitatively influence results (appendix 2 pp 5–6). It is, likewise, impossible to identify every potential contact an individual has, so contact tracing focuses on those close contacts who are most likely to be infected; hence our R is assuredly lower than the true reproductive number in the population. Asymptomatic travellers will be missed by symptom-based surveillance and, even if they are tested, some asymptomatic contacts might be missed because of the imperfect sensitivity of the RT-PCR test.20Fang Y Zhang H Xie J et al.Sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19: comparison to RT-PCR.Radiology. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1148/radiol.2020200432CrossrefGoogle Scholar Recovery time in Shenzhen is likely to be inflated because cases are required to be isolated for 2 weeks and release is conditional on a negative RT-PCR test. Although guidelines for contact tracing and case detection are supposed to be implemented across the country, whether the impact of contact tracing can be generalised to other parts of China depends on a range of factors, including local testing capacity and surveillance resources. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, it is important that we continue to expand our knowledge about its transmission and natural history. Data from the early phase of local outbreaks, when detailed contact tracing is possible and sources of infection can still be reliably inferred, are particularly powerful for estimating critical values pertinent to describing transmission and the natural history of a disease. This is especially true when information about uninfected contacts and mode of detection is used, as we have done here. The resulting estimates provide important inputs for interpreting surveillance data, evaluating interventions, and setting public health policy. This online publication has been corrected.

As of April 22, India has reported 18 985 confirmed cases and 603 deaths from COVID-19 in 31 states and union territories since its first case on Jan 30. India was quick to close its international borders and enforce an immediate lockdown, which WHO praised as “tough and timely”. The lockdown has also given the government time to prepare for a possible surge in cases when the pandemic is forecasted to peak in the coming weeks. Still, India's population of 1·3 billion across diverse states, health inequalities, widening economic and social disparities, and distinct cultural values present unique challenges. Preparedness and response to COVID-19 have differed at the state level. Kerala has drawn on its experience with the Nipah virus in 2018 to use extensive testing, contact tracing, and community mobilisation to contain the virus and maintain a very low mortality rate. It has also set up thousands of temporary shelters for migrant workers. Odisha's exposure to previous natural disasters meant crisis precautions were already in place and have been repurposed. Maharashtra has used drones to monitor physical distancing during lockdown and applied a cluster containment strategy: if three or more patients are diagnosed, all houses within 3 km are surveyed to detect further cases, trace contacts, and raise awareness. Whether this strategy will be successful is still unclear. The premise relies on there not being community transmission, and there is danger of stigmatisation and coercion. But states deserve much of the credit for India's COVID-19 response. The government's sudden enforcement of the lockdown seemed hastily prepared and immediately disadvantaged already vulnerable populations. There has been a mass exodus of migrant workers and concerns are rising about starvation among people who work in the informal economy. Implementing public health measures is difficult in places with overcrowded living conditions and inadequate hygiene and sanitation. Non-COVID-19 health services have been disrupted. Reports suggest that the government's efforts to provide financial support and a measure of food security to ease these pressures will be insufficient to meet demand. But better planning and communication could have helped avert this crisis. Rates of testing have been low (0·28 per 1000 people as of April 20). Capacity issues, absence of political will, and operational feasibility have been to blame. However, efforts to reverse the situation are underway as hundreds of thousands of testing kits have become available, and more testing companies and laboratories have been approved. Testing needs to be expanded exponentially as well as strategically as a tool to provide epidemiological evidence. India's response has also been constrained by a shortage of health workers, but this should be remedied by new reforms that would mobilise additional health-care workers from different sources. One threat to the COVID-19 response in India is the spread of misinformation driven by fear, stigma, and blame. There have been rising levels of violence against health-care workers and stigmatisation of people with or suspected of having COVID-19, which could impede reporting of illness. The pandemic has also been used to fan anti-Muslim sentiment and violence, after a gathering connected to the group Tablighi Jamaat was identified as being responsible for many cases. A welcome initiative to combat fake news is being led by a group of more than 400 multidisciplinary Indian scientists, who have voluntarily formed Indian Scientists' Response to COVID-19 to fight myths and misinformation about the disease. In India's favour are its young population (65% aged <35 years) and, to date, a less severe pandemic than was feared. The lockdown is already having the desired effect of flattening the epidemic curve. From April 20, states began easing restrictions on the basis of district profiling of infection hotspots (a form of cluster containment). The immediate challenge is to keep infections at manageable levels and ensure the ability to test, trace contacts, isolate patients, implement COVID care plans, and disseminate timely information. The central government should loosen its control and give states more autonomy over their funding and decision making. India must also pay much greater attention to the health sector and recognise the importance of having strong public sector capacity, especially in primary care and at the district level. India's public health-care system is chronically underfunded (at just 1·28% of GDP), leaving primary care weak. This pandemic could be the much needed wake-up call to the necessity of long-term changes to India's health system.

Policy makers are increasingly pressed to articulate their rationales and strategies for moving out of lockdown; the process of re-emergence is already cautiously starting in Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Wuhan, and some US states. As the counterpoise between further disease spread and socioeconomic costs is debated, it is essential that policy makers in all affected countries have the best possible data and understanding to inform any course of action. Strategies in various countries that aim to stagger return to work on the basis of disease severity risk and age do not take account of how exposing even lower-risk individuals, such as young people with no comorbidities, to the virus so as to increase herd immunity can still result in pandemic spread. The only selective pressure on SARS-CoV-2 is transmission—stop transmission and you stop the virus. The linchpin for a strategy to move out of lockdown seemingly rests on increased testing and contact tracing, possible return-to-work permits based on immune status,1Studdert DM Hall MA Disease control, civil liberties, and mass testing—calibrating restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMp2007637Google Scholar repurposed or new therapeutics,2Martinez MA Compounds with therapeutic potential against novel respiratory 2019 coronavirus.Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2020; 64: e00399-e00420Google Scholar and, finally, vaccination.3Amanat F Krammer F SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: status report.Immunity. 2020; 52: 583-589Google Scholar,  4Thanh Le T Andreadakis Z Kumar A et al.The COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5Google Scholar This approach is broadly sensible, yet immunology is a complex branch of molecular medicine and policy makers need to be alerted to important aspects of immunology in relation to COVID-19. There is no certainty as to the immunological correlates of antiviral protection or the proportion of the population who must attain them, making it impossible to identify a point when this level of immunity has been reached. Current discussion, for example, addresses the notion that scaled up antibody testing will determine who is immune, thus giving an indication of the extent of herd immunity and confirming who could re-enter the workforce. There are questions to be addressed about the accuracy of tests and practicalities of implementation of laboratory-based versus home-use assays.5Adams ER Anand R Andersson M et al.Evaluation of antibody testing for SARS-Cov-2 using ELISA and lateral flow immunoassays.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 20.) (preprint)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066407Google Scholar For any country contemplating these issues, another crucial question is how solid is the assumption that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein equate to functional protection? Furthermore, if presence of these antibodies is protective, how can it be decided what proportion of the population requires these antibodies to mitigate subsequent waves of cases of COVID-19? Any discussions should be informed by consideration of correlates of protection. Initially proposed by Stanley Plotkin,6Plotkin SA Vaccination against the major infectious diseases.CR Acad Sci III. 1999; 322: 943-951Google Scholar,  7Plotkin SA Immunologic correlates of protection induced by vaccination.Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2001; 20: 63-75Google Scholar this concept rests on the notion of empirically defined, quantifiable immune parameters that determine the attainment of protection against a given pathogen. Caution is needed because total measurable antibody is not precisely the same as protective, virus-neutralising antibody. Furthermore, studies in COVID-19 show that 10–20% of symptomatically infected people have little or no detectable antibody.8Tan W Lu Y Zhang J et al.Viral kinetics and antibody responses in patients with COVID-19.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 26.) (preprint)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382Google Scholar In some cases of COVID-19, low virus-binding antibody titres might correlate with lethal or near-lethal infection, or with having had a mild infection with little antigenic stimulation. Importantly, scientists must not only identify correlates of protection but also have a robust understanding of the correlates of progression to severe COVID-19, since knowledge of the latter will inform the former. The route to certainty on the degree and nature of the immunity required for protection will require evidence from formal proofs using approaches such as titrated transfers of antibodies and T lymphocytes to define protection in non-human primate models, as used, for example, in studies of Ebola virus.9Stanley DA Honko AN Asiedu C et al.Chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine generates acute and durable protective immunity against ebolavirus challenge.Nat Med. 2014; 20: 1126-1129Google Scholar A study of survivors of SARS showed that about 90% had functional, virus-neutralising antibodies and around 50% had strong T-lymphocyte responses.10Li CK Wu H Yan H et al.T cell responses to whole SARS coronavirus in humans.J Immunol. 2008; 181: 5490-5500Google Scholar These observations bolster confidence in a simple view that most survivors of severe COVID-19 would be expected to have protective antibodies. A caveat is that most studies, either of SARS survivors or of COVID-19 patients, have focused on people who were hospitalised and had severe, symptomatic disease. Similar data are urgently needed for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have not been hospitalised. How long is immunity to COVID-19 likely to last? The best estimate comes from the closely related coronaviruses and suggests that, in people who had an antibody response, immunity might wane, but is detectable beyond 1 year after hospitalisation.10Li CK Wu H Yan H et al.T cell responses to whole SARS coronavirus in humans.J Immunol. 2008; 181: 5490-5500Google Scholar,  11Temperton NJ Chan PK Simmons G et al.Longitudinally profiling neutralizing antibody response to SARS coronavirus with pseudotypes.Emerg Infect Dis. 2005; 11: 411-416Google Scholar,  12Choe PG Perera RAPM Park WB et al.MERS-CoV antibody responses 1 year after symptom onset, South Korea, 2015.Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23: 1079-1084Google Scholar Obviously, longitudinal studies with a duration of just over 1 year are of little reassurance given the possibility that there could be another wave of COVID-19 cases in 3 or 4 years. Specific T-lymphocyte immunity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, however, can be detectable for 4 years, considerably longer than antibody responses.13Channappanavar R Zhao J Perlman S T cell-mediated immune response to respiratory coronaviruses.Immunol Res. 2014; 59: 118-128Google Scholar Some of the uncertainty about COVID-19 protective immunity could be addressed by monitoring the frequency of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. Anecdotal reports of reinfection from China and South Korea should be regarded with caution because some individuals who seemed to have cleared SARS-CoV-2 infection and tested negative on PCR might nevertheless have harboured persistent virus. Virus sequencing studies will help to resolve this issue and in cases of confirmed reinfection it will be important to understand if reinfection correlates with lower immunity. Policy briefings in the UK and other countries have rightly emphasised the imperative to collect seroprevalence data.14Department of Health and Social Care, UK GovernmentGovernment begins large-scale virus infection and antibody test study.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-begins-large-scale-virus-infection-and-antibody-test-studyDate: April 23, 2020Date accessed: April 24, 2020Google Scholar This approach has sometimes been construed in a narrow sense as testing that would allow people back to work. However, seroprevalence data can show what proportion of a population has been exposed to and is potentially immune to the virus, and is thus wholly distinct from the snapshot of people who accessed PCR testing. How can one determine how much herd immunity is sufficient to mitigate subsequent substantial outbreaks of COVID-19? This calculation depends on several variables,15Anderson RM May RM Vaccination and herd immunity to infectious diseases.Nature. 1985; 318: 323-329Google Scholar including the calculated basic reproduction number (R0), currently believed to be about 2·2 for SARS-CoV-2.16Li Q Guan X Wu P et al.Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 1199-1207Google Scholar On the basis of this estimated R0, the herd immunity calculation suggests that at least 60% of the population would need to have protective immunity, either from natural infection or vaccination.17Guerra FM Bolotin S Lim G et al.The basic reproduction number (RO) of measles: a systematic review.Lancet Infect Dis. 2017; 17: e420-e428Google Scholar This percentage increases if R0 has been underestimated. Most of the available COVID-19 serology data derive from people who have been hospitalised with severe infection.8Tan W Lu Y Zhang J et al.Viral kinetics and antibody responses in patients with COVID-19.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 26.) (preprint)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382Google Scholar,  18Wu F Wang A Liu M et al.Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 20.)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365Google Scholar In this group, around 90% develop IgG antibodies within the first 2 weeks of symptomatic infection and this appearance coincides with disappearance of virus,18Wu F Wang A Liu M et al.Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 20.)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365Google Scholar supporting a causal relationship between these events. However, a key question concerns antibodies in non-hospitalised individuals who either have milder disease or no symptoms. Anecdotal results from community samples yield estimates of under 10% of tested “controls” developing specific IgG antibodies. We await larger seroprevalence datasets, but it seems likely that natural exposure during this pandemic might, in the short to medium term, not deliver the required level of herd immunity and there will be a substantial need for mass vaccination programmes. There are more than 100 candidate COVID-19 vaccines in development, with a handful in, or soon to be in, phase 1 trials to assess safety and immunogenicity.4Thanh Le T Andreadakis Z Kumar A et al.The COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5Google Scholar Candidate vaccines encompass diverse platforms that differ in the potency with which immunity is stimulated, the specific arsenal of immune mediators mobilised, the number of required boosts, durability of protection, and tractability of production and supply chains.3Amanat F Krammer F SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: status report.Immunity. 2020; 52: 583-589Google Scholar,  4Thanh Le T Andreadakis Z Kumar A et al.The COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5Google Scholar Safety evaluation of candidate COVID-19 vaccines will need to be of the highest rigour. Some features of the immune response induced by infection, such as high concentrations of tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 6, which could be elicited by some candidate vaccines, have been identified as biomarkers of severe outcome.19Feldmann M Maini RN Woody JN et al.Trials of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy for COVID-19 are urgently needed.Lancet. 2020;  (published online April 9.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30858-8Google Scholar Researchers should be commended for decades of iterative efforts, bringing us to a point where there are many candidate vaccines in development against a novel virus first sequenced in January, 2020. Delivery of efficacious vaccines is not a competitive race to the finish, but a considered evaluation of a safe, potent, global response.4Thanh Le T Andreadakis Z Kumar A et al.The COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5Google Scholar Few would disagree that science should guide the clinical therapeutic approach to an infected person. Science must also guide policy decisions. Reliance on comprehensive seroprevalence data and a solid, research-based grasp of correlates of protection will allow policy to be guided by secure, evidence-based assumptions on herd immunity, rather than optimistic guesses.

We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

In December, 2019, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, became the centre of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. By Jan 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), from these patients with virus-infected pneumonia,1Phelan AL Katz R Gostin LO The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Jan 30.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.1097Google Scholar,  2Gorbalenya AE Baker SC Baric RS et al.Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses—a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online Feb 11.)

To our knowledge, no previous studies have been done among patients with definite outcomes. The estimation of risk factors for severe disease and death in these earlier case series are therefore not very robust. Additionally, details of the clinical and virological course of illness have not yet been well described. Here, we present details of all patients admitted to the two designated hospitals in Wuhan—Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital—with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and a definite clinical outcome (death or discharge) as of Jan 31, 2020. We aim to explore risk factors of in-hospital death for patients and describe the clinical course of symptoms, viral shedding, and temporal changes of laboratory findings during hospitalisation. Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on Feb 23, 2020, for articles that documented the risk factors of mortality and viral shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the search terms (“novel coronavirus” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “COVID-19”) AND (“death” OR “mortality” OR “viral shedding”) with no language or time restrictions. Age, comorbidities, lymphocytopenia and elevated alanine aminotransferase, d-dimer, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, prothrombin time, and disease severity were reported to be associated with intensive care unit admission. However, no published works were found about the risk factors of mortality for adult patients with COVID-19. One study compared the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat and nasopharyngeal swab in 17 patients with COVID-19.Added value of this studyIn this retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients in two hospitals in Wuhan, China, we found increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer levels greater than 1·0 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.

Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future. This retrospective cohort study included two cohorts of adult inpatients (≥18 years old) from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China). All adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were screened, and those who died or were discharged between Dec 29, 2019 (ie, when the first patients were admitted), and Jan 31, 2020, were included in our study. Since these two hospitals were the only designated hospitals for transfer of patients with COVID-19 from other hospitals in Wuhan until Feb 1, 2020, our study enrolled all adult inpatients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and had a definite outcome (dead or discharged) at the early stage of the outbreak. Before Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results were not available in the electronic medical records, from which data for this study were obtained retrospectively; therefore, this study includes 29 of the 41 patients originally reported on.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar The study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of Jinyintan Hospital (KY-2020–01.01) and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission as described previously.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardised data collection form, which was a modified version of the WHO/International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case record form for severe acute respiratory infections. All data were checked by two physicians (FZ and ZL) and a third researcher (GF) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers. Methods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described elsewhere.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Briefly, four institutions—the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences—were responsible for SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. From Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health institutions, and Jingyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Throat-swab specimens were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 PCR re-examination every other day after clinical remission of symptoms, including fever, cough, and dyspnoea, but only qualitative data were available. The criteria for discharge were absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs in chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained at least 24 h apart. Routine blood examinations were complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), myocardial enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin, and procalcitonin. Chest radiographs or CT scan were also done for all inpatients. Frequency of examinations was determined by the treating physician. Fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37·3°C. Sepsis and septic shock were defined according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Secondary infection was diagnosed when patients showed clinical symptoms or signs of pneumonia or bacteraemia and a positive culture of a new pathogen was obtained from lower respiratory tract specimens (qualified sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) or blood samples after admission.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Ventilator-associated pneumonia was diagnosed according to the guidelines for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia.8Kalil AC Metersky ML Klompas M et al.Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society.Clin Infect Dis. 2016; 63: e61-e111Google Scholar Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines9Khwaja A KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury.Nephron Clin Pract. 2012; 120: c179-c184Google Scholar and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition.10Ranieri VM Rubenfeld GD Thompson BT et al.Acute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin Definition.JAMA. 2012; 307: 2526-2533Google Scholar Acute cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or if new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar The illness severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0).11National Health Commission of the People's Republic of ChinaChinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0).http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202002/8334a8326dd94d329df351d7da8aefc2/files/b218cfeb1bc54639af227f922bf6b817.pdfDate: Feb 19, 2020Google Scholar Coagulopathy was defined as a 3-second extension of prothrombin time or a 5-second extension of activated partial thromboplastin time. Hypoproteinaemia was defined as blood albumin of less than 25 g/L. Exposure history was defined as exposure to people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the Wuhan seafood market. Continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%), respectively. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, χ2 test, or Fisher's exact test to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Considering the total number of deaths (n=54) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings and clinical constraints. Previous studies have shown blood levels of d-dimer and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to be higher in critically ill or fatal cases, whereas lymphopenia and cardiovascular disease have been less commonly observed in non-critical or surviving patients with SARS-COV-2 infection.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar,  6Wang D Hu B Hu C et al.Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Feb 7.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.1585Google Scholar,  12Yang X Yu Y Xu J et al.Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study.Lancet Respir Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 24)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5Google Scholar Similar risk factors, including older age, have been reported associated with adverse clinical outcomes in adults with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).3Chan JWM Ng CK Chan YH et al.Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).Thorax. 2003; 58: 686-689Google Scholar,  13Arabi YM Balkhy HH Hayden FG et al.Middle East respiratory syndrome.N Engl J Med. 2017; 376: 584-594Google Scholar Some laboratory findings, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, and IL-6, might be unavailable in emergency circumstances. Therefore, we chose lymphocyte count, d-dimer, SOFA score, coronary heart disease, and age as the five variables for our multivariable logistic regression model. We excluded variables from the univariable analysis if their between-group differences were not significant, if their accuracy was unconfirmed (eg, exposure, which was self-reported), if the number of events was too small to calculate odds ratios, and if they had colinearity with the SOFA score. We compared patient characteristics between the two hospitals and used a generalised linear model to adjust for possible differences in patients’ characteristics and treatment between the two study centres. A two-sided α of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software (version 9.4), unless otherwise indicated. The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors (BC and HC) had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 813 adult patients were hospitalised in Jinyintan Hospital or Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital with COVID-19 before Jan 31, 2020. After excluding 613 patients that were still hospitalised or not confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection as of Jan 31, 2020, and nine inpatients without available key information in their medical records, we included 191 inpatients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) in the final analysis. 54 patients died during hospitalisation and 137 were discharged. The median age of the 191 patients was 56·0 years (IQR 46·0–67·0), ranging from 18 years to 87 years, and most patients were male (table 1). Comorbidities were present in nearly half of patients, with hypertension being the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease (table 1). The most common symptoms on admission were fever and cough, followed by sputum production and fatigue (table 1). Lymphocytopenia occurred in 77 (40%) patients. 181 (95%) patients received antibiotics and 41 (21%) received antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir; table 2). Systematic corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin use differed significantly between non-survivors and survivors (table 2).

The median time from illness onset (ie, before admission) to discharge was 22·0 days (IQR 18·0–25·0), whereas the median time to death was 18·5 days (15·0–22·0; table 2). 32 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. The median time from illness onset to invasive mechanical ventilation was 14·5 days (12·0–19·0). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in three patients, none of whom survived. Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure, and septic shock (table 2). Half of non-survivors experienced a secondary infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The frequency of complications were higher in non-survivors than survivors (table 2). In univariable analysis, odds of in-hospital death was higher in patients with diabetes or coronary heart disease (table 3). Age, lymphopenia, leucocytosis, and elevated ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, IL-6, prothrombin time, creatinine, and procalcitonin were also associated with death (table 3).Table 3Risk factors associated with in-hospital deathUnivariable OR (95% CI)p valueMultivariable OR (95% CI)p valueDemographics and clinical characteristicsAge, years** Per 1 unit increase.1·14 (1·09–1·18)<0·00011·10 (1·03–1·17)0·0043Female sex (vs male)0·61 (0·31–1·20)0·15....Current smoker (vs non-smoker)2·23 (0·65–7·63)0·20....Comorbidity present (vs not present)Chronic obstructive lung disease5·40 (0·96–30·40)0·056....Coronary heart disease21·40 (4·64–98·76)<0·00012·14 (0·26–17·79)0·48Diabetes2·85 (1·35–6·05)0·0062....Hypertension3·05 (1·57–5·92)0·0010....Respiratory rate, breaths per min≤241 (ref)......>248·89 (4·34–18·19)<0·0001....SOFA score6·14 (3·48–10·85)<0·00015·65 (2·61–12·23)<0·0001qSOFA score12·00 (5·06–28·43)<0·0001....Laboratory findingsWhite blood cell count, × 109 per L<40·73 (0·26–2·10)0·56....4–101 (ref)......>106·60 (3·02–14·41)<0·0001....Lymphocyte count, × 109 per L** Per 1 unit increase.0·02 (0·01–0·08)<0·00010·19 (0·02–1·62)0·13ALT, U/L≤401 (ref)......>402·87 (1·48–5·57)0·0018....Creatinine, μmol/L≤1331 (ref)......>1334·39 (1·01–19·06)0·048....Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L≤2451 (ref)......>24545·43 (6·10–338·44)0·0002....Creatine kinase, U/L≤1851 (ref)......>1852·56 (1·03–6·36)0·043....High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, pg/mL≤281 (ref)......>2880·07 (10·34–620·36)<0·0001....D-dimer, μg/mL≤0·51 (ref)..1 (ref)..> 0·51·96 (0·52–7·43)0·322·14 (0·21–21·39)0·52> 120·04 (6·52–61·56)<0·000118·42 (2·64–128·55)0·0033Prothrombin time, s<161 (ref)......≥164·62 (1·29–16·50)0·019....Serum ferritin, μg/L≤3001 (ref)......>3009·10 (2·04–40·58)0·0038....IL-6, pg/mL** Per 1 unit increase.1·12 (1·03–1·23)0·0080....Procalcitonin, ng/mL** Per 1 unit increase.13·75 (1·81–104·40)0·011....OR=odds ratio.

We included 171 patients with complete data for all variables (53 non-survivors and 118 survivors) in the multivariable logistic regression model. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL at admission were associated with increased odds of death (table 3). When adjusting for study centre, our generalised linear model showed similar results (appendix p 5). For survivors, the median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) from illness onset, but the virus was continuously detectable until death in non-survivors (table 2; figure 1). The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. Among 29 patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir and were discharged, the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14·0 days (IQR 10·0–17·0) and the median duration of viral shedding was 22·0 days (18·0–24·0). The median duration of viral shedding was 19·0 days (17·0–22·0) in patients with severe disease status and 24·0 days (22·0–30·0) in patients with critical disease status.Figure 1Clinical courses of major symptoms and outcomes and duration of viral shedding from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19Show full captionFigure shows median duration of symptoms and onset of complications and outcomes.

Major laboratory markers were tracked from illness onset (figure 2). Baseline lymphocyte count was significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors; in survivors, lymphocyte count was lowest on day 7 after illness onset and improved during hospitalisation, whereas severe lymphopenia was observed until death in non-survivors. Levels of d-dimer, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course, and increased with illness deterioration (figure 2). In non-survivors, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I increased rapidly from day 16 after disease onset, whereas lactate dehydrogenase increased for both survivors and non-survivors in the early stage of illness, but decreased from day 13 for survivors.Figure 2Temporal changes in laboratory markers from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19Show full captionFigure shows temporal changes in d-dimer (A), lymphocytes (B), IL-6 (C), serum ferritin (D), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (E), and lactate dehydrogenase (F). Differences between survivors and non-survivors were significant for all timepoints shown, except for day 4 after illness onset for d-dimer, IL-6, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I.

Median time from illness onset to dyspnoea was similar in survivors and non-survivors, with a median duration of dyspnoea of 13·0 days (9·0–16·5) for survivors (table 2; figure 1). In survivors, the median duration of fever was 12·0 days (8·0–13·0) and cough persisted for 19·0 days (IQR 12·0–23·0; figure 1). 62 (45%) survivors still had cough on discharge and 39 (72%) non-survivors still had cough at the time of death. The dynamic profiles of fever, cough, and dyspnoea are shown in the appendix (p 6). Sepsis developed at a median of 9·0 days (7·0–13·0) after illness onset among all patients, followed by ARDS (12·0 days [8·0–15·0]), acute cardiac injury (15·0 days [10·0–17·0]), acute kidney injury (15·0 days [13·0–19·5]), and secondary infection (17·0 days [13·0–19·0]). The initiation time and duration of systematic corticosteroid use was also similar between the two groups. Among non-survivors, the median time from illness onset was 10·0 days (7·0–14·0) to sepsis, 12·0 days (8·0–15·0) to ARDS, 14·5 days (9·5–17·0) to acute cardiac injury, and 17·0 days (13·0–19·0) to secondary infection (figure 1; table 2). Among survivors, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury were observed in one patient each, occurring 9 days (acute kidney injury), 14 days (secondary infection), and 21 days (acute cardiac injury) after illness onset. The median time from dyspnoea to intubation was 10·0 days (IQR 5·0–12·5) for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation and the time from invasive mechanical ventilation to occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 8·0 days (2·0–9·0; figure 1). This retrospective cohort study identified several risk factors for death in adults in Wuhan who were hospitalised with COVID-19. In particular, older age, d-dimer levels greater than 1 μg/mL, and higher SOFA score on admission were associated with higher odds of in-hospital death. Additionally, elevated levels of blood IL-6, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and lactate dehydrogenase and lymphopenia were more commonly seen in severe COVID-19 illness. Sustained viral detection in throat samples was observed in both survivors and non-survivors. Previously, older age has been reported as an important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS.14Choi KW Chau TN Tsang O et al.Outcomes and prognostic factors in 267 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.Ann Intern Med. 2003; 139: 715-723Google Scholar,  15Hong K-H Choi J-P Hong S-H et al.Predictors of mortality in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).Thorax. 2018; 73: 286-289Google Scholar The current study confirmed that increased age was associated with death in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies in macaques inoculated with SARS-CoV found that older macaques had stronger host innate responses to virus infection than younger adults, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, whereas expression of type I interferon beta was reduced.16Smits SL de Lang A van den Brand JMA et al.Exacerbated innate host response to SARS-CoV in aged non-human primates.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000756-eGoogle Scholar The age-dependent defects in T-cell and B-cell function and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a deficiency in control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses, potentially leading to poor outcome.17Opal SM Girard TD Ely EW The immunopathogenesis of sepsis in elderly patients.Clin Infect Dis. 2005; 41: S504-S512Google Scholar SOFA score is a good diagnostic marker for sepsis and septic shock, and reflects the state and degree of multi-organ dysfunction.18Singer M Deutschman CS Seymour CW et al.The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).JAMA. 2016; 315: 801-810Google Scholar,  19Ferreira FL Bota DP Bross A Mélot C Vincent JL Serial evaluation of the SOFA score to predict outcome in critically ill patients.JAMA. 2001; 286: 1754-1758Google Scholar Although bacterial infections are usually regarded as a leading cause of sepsis, viral infection can also cause sepsis syndrome. Previously, we determined that sepsis occurred in nearly 40% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia due to viral infection.20Zhou F Wang Y Liu Y et al.Disease severity and clinical outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses in adults: a multicentre prospective registry study from the CAP-China Network.Eur Respir J. 2019; 54: 1802406Google Scholar In the current study, we found that more than half of patients developed sepsis. Additionally, we found that more than 70% of patients had white blood cell count below 10·0 × 109 per L or procalcitonin below 0·25 ng/mL, and no bacterial pathogens were detected in these patients on admission. Sepsis was a common complication, which might be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis of sepsis in COVID-19 illness. Cardiac complications, including new or worsening heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction are common in patients with pneumonia. Cardiac arrest occurs in about 3% of inpatients with pneumonia.21Marrie TJ Shariatzadeh MR Community-acquired pneumonia requiring admission to an intensive care unit: a descriptive study.Medicine (Baltimore). 2007; 86: 103-111Google Scholar Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation.22Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Shachkina S Chirinos JA Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system.Lancet. 2013; 381: 496-505Google Scholar Coronary heart disease has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections.22Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Shachkina S Chirinos JA Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system.Lancet. 2013; 381: 496-505Google Scholar,  23Udell JA Zawi R Bhatt DL et al.Association between influenza vaccination and cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients: a meta-analysis.JAMA. 2013; 310: 1711-1720Google Scholar,  24Blackburn R Zhao H Pebody R Hayward A Warren-Gash C Laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections as predictors of hospital admission for myocardial infarction and stroke: time-series analysis of English data for 2004–2015.Clin Infect Dis. 2018; 67: 8-17Google Scholar In this study, increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I during hospitalisation was found in more than half of those who died. The first autopsy of a 53-year-old woman with chronic renal failure in Jinyintan Hospital showed acute myocardial infarction (data not published; personal communication with a pathologist from the Chinese Academy of Science). About 90% of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity, marked by increased d-dimer concentrations.25Milbrandt EB Reade MC Lee M et al.Prevalence and significance of coagulation abnormalities in community-acquired pneumonia.Mol Med. 2009; 15: 438-445Google Scholar In this study, we found d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL is associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. High levels of d-dimer have a reported association with 28-day mortality in patients with infection or sepsis identified in the emergency department.26Rodelo JR De la Rosa G Valencia ML et al.D-dimer is a significant prognostic factor in patients with suspected infection and sepsis.Am J Emerg Med. 2012; 30: 1991-1999Google Scholar Contributory mechanisms include systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that are mediators of atherosclerosis directly contributing to plaque rupture through local inflammation, induction of procoagulant factors, and haemodynamic changes, which predispose to ischaemia and thrombosis.27Smeeth L Thomas SL Hall AJ Hubbard R Farrington P Vallance P Risk of myocardial infarction and stroke after acute infection or vaccination.N Engl J Med. 2004; 351: 2611-2618Google Scholar,  28Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Wells GA Chirinos JA Chen L Fine MJ Cardiac complications in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: incidence, timing, risk factors, and association with short-term mortality.Circulation. 2012; 125: 773-781Google Scholar,  29Davidson JA Warren-Gash C Cardiovascular complications of acute respiratory infections: current research and future directions.Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2019; 17: 939-942Google Scholar In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed on myocytes and vascular endothelial cells,30Gallagher PE Ferrario CM Tallant EA Regulation of ACE2 in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts.Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2008; 295: H2373-H2479Google Scholar,  31Mendoza-Torres E Oyarzún A Mondaca-Ruff D et al.ACE2 and vasoactive peptides: novel players in cardiovascular/renal remodeling and hypertension.Ther Adv Cardiovasc Dis. 2015; 9: 217-237Google Scholar so there is at least theoretical potential possibility of direct cardiac involvement by the virus. Of note, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue has been documented in fatal cases of COVID-19, although viral detection studies were not reported.32Xu Z Shi L Wang Y et al.Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.Lancet Respir Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 18)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-XGoogle Scholar The level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of transmission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. For SARS-CoV, viral RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from about a third of patients as long as 4 weeks after disease onset.33Xu D Zhang Z Jin L et al.Persistent shedding of viable SARS-CoV in urine and stool of SARS patients during the convalescent phase.Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2005; 24: 165-171Google Scholar Similarly, the duration of MERS-CoV RNA detection in lower respiratory specimans persisted for at least 3 weeks,34Corman VM Albarrak AM Omrani AS et al.Viral shedding and antibody response in 37 patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection.Clin Infect Dis. 2016; 62: 477-483Google Scholar,  35Oh MD Park WB Choe PG et al.Viral load kinetics of MERS coronavirus infection.N Engl J Med. 2016; 375: 1303-1405Google Scholar whereas the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection has not been well characterised. In the current study, we found that the detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for a median of 20 days in survivors and that it was sustained until death in non-survivors. This has important implications for both patient isolation decision making and guidance around the length of antiviral treatment. In severe influenza virus infection, prolonged viral shedding was associated with fatal outcome and delayed antiviral treatment was an independent risk factor for prolonged virus detection.36Wang Y Guo Q Yan Z et al.Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding in patients with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection.J Infect Dis. 2018; 217: 1708-1717Google Scholar Similarly, effective antiviral treatment might improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in the current study. Randomised clinical trials for lopinavir/ritonavir (ChiCTR2000029308) and intravenous remdesivir (NCT04257656, NCT04252664) in treatment of COVID-19 are currently in progress. Our study has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective study design, not all laboratory tests were done in all patients, including lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and serum ferritin. Therefore, their role might be underestimated in predicting in-hospital death. Second, patients were sometimes transferred late in their illness to the two included hospitals. Lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high-dose corticosteroid use might have also contributed to the poor clinical outcomes in some patients. Third, the estimated duration of viral shedding is limited by the frequency of respiratory specimen collection, lack of quantitative viral RNA detection, and relatively low positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat-swabs.37Zou L Ruan F Huang M et al.SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMc2001737Google Scholar Fourth, by excluding patients still in hospital as of Jan 31, 2020, and thus relatively more severe disease at an earlier stage, the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of COVID-19. Last but not least, interpretation of our findings might be limited by the sample size. However, by including all adult patients in the two designated hospitals for COVID-19, we believe our study population is representative of cases diagnosed and treated in Wuhan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort study among patients with COVID-19 who have experienced a definite outcome. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and elevated d-dimer at admission were risk factors for death of adult patients with COVID-19. The prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for testing novel coronavirus antiviral interventions in efforts to improve outcomes. This online publication has been corrected.
