Since the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. ACEis do not inhibit ACE2. Although ARBs have been shown to up-regulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS-COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies. Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.",2020-04-21 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

This was the trigger of one of the most serious clusters of COVID-19 in the world, outside of China. Despite aggressive restraint and inhibition efforts, COVID-19 continues to increase, and the total number of infected patients in Italy is growing daily. After six weeks the total number of patients reached 128,948 cases (April 5, 2020), with the higher case-fatality rate (15,887 deaths) dominated by old and very old patients.                   This sudden health emergency severely challenged the Italian Health System, in particular acute care hospitals and intensive care units. In one hospital, geriatric observation units were created, the experience of which can be extremely useful for European countries, the United States, and all countries that in the coming days will face a similar situation.",2020-04-23 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Intervention(s)                   None.

Results                   Seventy-nine reports formed the basis of the review. Coronavirus binding to cells involves the S1 domain of the spike protein to receptors present in reproductive tissues, including angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins. SARS-CoV-1 may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following COVID-19 infection. Gonadotropin-dependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or MERS, but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum. COVID-19 infections in pregnancy are associated with preterm delivery. Postpartum neonatal transmission from mother to child has been reported.                                                   Conclusion                   COVID-19 infection may adversely affect some pregnant women and their offspring. Additional studies are needed to assess effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male and female fertility.",2020-04-16 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory. Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website. Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website. In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement. The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD. In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis. Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients.",2020-04-20 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Its rapid transmissibility has transformed healthcare delivery and forced countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. The vast majority of U.S. cardiac surgical programs have deferred all but truly emergent/urgent operative procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the healthcare system and to mobilize resources to combat the pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase worldwide, the incidence of new cases has begun to decline in many North American cities. This “flattening of the curve” has prompted interest in re-opening the economy, relaxing public health restrictions, and resuming non-urgent health care delivery.",2020-05-12 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

However, no data are available on the use of LUS in children with COVID-19 pneumonia. In this report, we describe LUS features of 10 consecutively admitted children with COVID-19 in two tertiary-level pediatric hospitals in Rome. LUS revealed signs of lung involvement during COVID-19 infection. In particular, vertical artifacts (70%), pleural irregularities (60%), areas of white lung (10%) and subpleural consolidations (10%) were the main findings in patients with COVID-19. No cases of pleural effusions were found. According to our experience, the routine use of LUS in the evaluation of children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, when performed by clinicians with documented experience in LUS, was useful in diagnosing and monitoring pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia, reducing unnecessary radiation/sedation in children and exposure of health care workers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",2020-05-03 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Objective We sought to address the dynamic changes of hematologic and immunologic biomarkers and their associations with severity and outcomes of the disease. Methods A retrospective study including 548 COVID-19 patients with clarified outcome (discharged or deceased) from a national cohort in China was performed. Cross-sectional and longitudinal variations were compared and the associations with different severity and outcomes were analyzed. Results On admission, the counts of lymphocytes, T cell subsets, eosinophils and platelets decreased markedly, especially in severe/critical and fatal patients. Increased neutrophil count and neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio were predominant in severe/critical cases or non-survivors. During hospitalization, eosinophils, lymphocytes and platelets were shown an increasing trend in survivors, but maintained lower levels or dropped significantly afterwards in non-survivors. Non-survivors kept high level or showed an upward trend for neutrophils, IL-6, procalcitonin, D-dimer, amyloid A protein and C-reactive protein, which were kept stable or shown downward trend in survivors. Positive correlation between CD8+ T cell and lymphocytes count was found in survivors but not in non-survivors. A multivariate Cox regression model suggested that restored levels of lymphocytes, eosinophils and platelets could serve as the predictors for the recovery, while progressive increases in neutrophils, basophils and IL-6 were associated with fatal outcome. Conclusions Hematologic and immunologic impairment showed a significantly different profile between survivors and non-survivors in COVID-19 patients with different severity. The longitudinal variations of these biomarkers could serve to predict recovery or fatal outcome.",2020-05-11 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Methods                   We studied consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy (13.02.2020–10.04.2020). The primary outcome was any thromboembolic complication, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary outcome was overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).                                                   Results                   We included 388 patients (median age 66 years, 68% men, 16% requiring intensive care [ICU]). Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward. Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4%–11.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward). Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24 h of hospital admission. Forty-four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA). The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients.                                                   Conclusions                   The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.",2020-04-23 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

The optimal management of patients infected with COVID-19 is still unclear, although the consensus is moving toward the need of a biphasic approach. During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7–10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent, with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anticytokine drugs) may be considered. This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the hemophagocytic syndrome. The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities. Here we present the therapeutic approach used in Brescia (Italy) for managing patients infected with COVID-19 who underwent kidney transplantation and are receiving hemodialysis. Furthermore, we provide some clinical and physiopathological background, as well as preliminary outcome data of our cohort, to better clarify the pathogenesis of the disease and clinical management.",2020-04-04 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15th, 2020. Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru. We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government. While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.",2020-05-12 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Data Synthesis                   COVID-19 mainly invades the lungs, causing its serious damage. Studies found that COVID-19 induced the renin-angiotensin system imbalance, inflammatory storm, hypoxemia and stress response et al, all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis, even increasing mortality in COVID-19 patients.                                                   Conclusions                   In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. Early identification, timely and effective treatments, maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis.                   The pandemic of COVID-19 has been taking lives worldwide. It caused by a novel coronavirus which human being are lack of defensive function in whole population. It targets human’s lung and causes serious damage of lungs. Based on early reports, for people with underlying heart issues, the concerns are serious. It appears people over 65 with coronary heart diseases or hypertension is more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms. In addition, some of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had cardiovascular diseases in China. As characteristic analysis of COVID-19 patients, hypertension and severe myocardial damage contribute to severity [1] and mortality of COVID-19 patients [2]. Therefore, to better understand the development of COVID-19 and the impacts of cardiovascular diseases will add valuable measures to the management of COVID-19 patients.",2020-04-08 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Methods                   We retrospectively included COVID-19 patients with anosmia between March 1st and March 17th, 2020. We used SARS-CoV-2 real time PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases.                                                   Results                   Fifty-four of 114 patients (47%) with confirmed COVID-19 reported anosmia. Mean age of the 54 patients was 47 (±16) years; 67% were females and 37% were hospitalised. The median Charlson comorbidity index was 0.70 (±1.6 [0–7]). Forty-six patients (85%) had dysgeusia and 28% presented with pneumonia. Anosmia began 4.4 (±1.9 [1–8]) days after infection onset. The mean duration of anosmia was 8.9 (±6.3 [1–21]) days and 98% of patients recovered within 28 days.                                                   Conclusions                   Anosmia was present in half of our European COVID-19 patients and was often associated with dysgeusia.",2020-04-17 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Prevalence of COVID-19 by sexes differs between countries. The trend in Spain shows an unequal pattern, initially more frequent in men, but women outnumbered them from March 31, after two weeks lockdown. Infections are more frequent in women than in men in close contact with probable/confirmed COVID-19 cases. Consistent with deaths in men, they are hospitalized more frequently than women: Significant gender differences in signs/symptoms can drive this pattern, already observed in other pathologies. In late April, excess mortality is the same in women (67%) than in men (66%). But, lack of exhaustive information on deaths from COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients may contribute to lower notification of deaths in women. Invisibility of data by sex and gender is probably affecting negatively women with COVID -19 more than men.",2020-05-04 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Two months into the COVID-19 outbreak, however, a retrospective study in China involving more than 200 participants revealed a neurological component to COVID-19 in a subset of patients. The observed symptoms, the cause of which remains unclear, included impaired consciousness, skeletal muscle injury and acute cerebrovascular disease, and appeared more frequently in severe disease. Since then, findings from several studies have hinted at various possible neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Here, we review the historical association between neurological complications and highly pathological coronaviruses including SARS, MERS and COVID-19. We draw from evidence derived from past coronavirus outbreaks, noting the similarities and differences between SARS and MERS and the current COVID-19 pandemic. We end by briefly discussing possible mechanisms by which the coronavirus impacts on the human nervous system, as well as neurology-specific considerations that arise from the repercussions of COVID-19.",2020-05-05 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Methods                   We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-COV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission.                                                   Findings                   Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8 %, 48.0 %, and 95.8 % of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1–2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3 %, 8.0 %, and 62.5 %, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4 % (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3 % (55/74) and 82.4 % (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively.                                                   Conclusion                   The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.",2020-04-30 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Given that the virus is transmitted via droplets, open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health-care workers (HCWs). The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCWs.                                                   Research Question                   ▪▪▪                                                   Study Design and Methods                   A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process.                                                   Results                   The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements.                                                   Interpretation                   The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections. In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for nonurgent indications, and if necessary to perform, HCWs should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.",2020-05-01 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Most of these strategies were used during the Middle East Respiratory syndrome outbreak and were applied again successfully during the COVID-19 outbreak. The reallocation of health care capacity, repurposing of hospitals, and close collaboration between the government and the health care committee might have been the key to successfully addressing the crisis of COVID-19 given the shortage of health care resources.",2020-05-05 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether it explained the higher incidence of COVID-19 in black and South Asian people.                                                   Methods                   UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37–73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration and ethnicity, were linked to COVID-19 test results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and confirmed COVID-19, and the association between ethnicity and both 25(OH)D and COVID-19.                                                   Results                   Complete data were available for 348,598 UK Biobank participants. Of these, 449 had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99–0.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998–1.01; p = 0.208). Ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (blacks versus whites OR = 5.32, 95% CI = 3.68–7.70, p-value<0.001; South Asians versus whites OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.65–4.25, p-value<0.001). Adjustment for 25(OH)D concentration made little difference to the magnitude of the association.                                                   Conclusions                   Our findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of COVID-19 infection, nor that vitamin D concentration may explain ethnic differences in COVID-19 infection.",2020-05-07 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains controversial. This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful implications for policymakers and the public. Daily data on meteorological conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020. Log-linear generalized additive model was used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, including wind speed, median age of the national population, Global Health Security Index, Human Development Index and population density. Our findings revealed that temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to daily new cases and deaths. A 1 °C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. The results remained robust when different lag structures and the sensitivity analysis were used. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially suppressed with temperature and humidity increases. However, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19.",2020-04-28 00:00:00,ELSEVIER,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

To flatten the curve, some African governments have imposed stringent public health measures (lockdown) based on physical distancing to reduce transmission. However, the safety of this approach in poor communities has not been evaluated, and it is plausible that lives lost to lockdown could exceed those saved from COVID-19. Potentially fatal unintended consequences include widespread economic disruption and hunger, worsening food insecurity if harvesting is disrupted, and increased domestic and state actor violence. Large numbers of African patients with HIV and tuberculosis depend on functional health services, with substantial individual and public health consequences if treatment access is disrupted.2Pai M AIDS, TB and malaria: coronavirus threatens the endgame.https://www.forbes.com/sites/madhukarpai/2020/03/29/aids-tb-and-malaria-coronavirus-threatens-the-endgame/#24e4c72a5afdDate: March 29, 2020Date accessed: April 1, 2020Google Scholar Although anticipated by national programmes, some treatment interruptions are inevitable during prolonged lockdown. With clear understanding of risk, governments can make informed decisions about harms and benefits. We used Spiegelhalter's approach to compare age-group specific infection fatality ratios from COVID-19 to background (non-COVID-19) mortality risk in Malawi, South Africa, the UK, and India.3Spiegelhalter D How much ‘normal’ risk does COVID represent?.https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196Date: March 21, 2020Date accessed: April 1, 2020Google Scholar,  4Verity R Okell LC Dorigatti I et al.Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online March 30.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedGoogle Scholar,  5Ferguson N Laydon D Nedjati-Gilani G et al.Report 9: impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand.https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdfDate: March 16, 2020Date accessed: April 1, 2020Google Scholar This assumes COVID-19 infection fatality ratios similar to China, but true age-specific case-fatality rates might be higher with fragile health systems. For context, Malawi has not yet triggered lockdown, whereas the UK, South Africa, and India have. We estimate that in the UK, having COVID-19 confers risk of death equivalent to approximately 12 months of background mortality risk, averaged across all age groups. By contrast, in Malawi this risk is equivalent to 4 months of background mortality (appendix). This reflects higher background mortality rates in Malawi, underscoring the fragility of health under normal circumstances. Malawi (median age 17 years) also has relatively few older citizens, with 6·6% of the population older than 60 years. This makes alternative strategies potentially safer and more feasible than lockdown—eg, community-led approaches to support older people to self-isolate with provision of food, medicine, and wellbeing support.6Dahab M van Zandvoort K Flasche S et al.COVID-19 control in low-income settings and displaced populations: what can realistically be done?.https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/covid-19-control-low-income-settings-and-displaced-populations-what-canDate: March 20, 2020Date accessed: April 1, 2020Google Scholar Although we fully agree that macroeconomic arguments against lockdown cannot justify widespread loss of life in Europe and Asia, the considerations are very different in Africa, where lockdown could cost many lives. We urge African governments to carefully contextualise safe physical distancing policies that maximise likely benefits. Without a context-specific, ethical approach to physical distancing, unintended harms from stringent lockdown could pose more harm than the direct effects of COVID-19 itself.

Nine patients were physicians, and two were health-care workers. All patients had normal blood parameters at the time of ophthalmological evaluation. Nine patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (using nasal and oral swabs), and two patients tested positive in antibody tests for COVID-19. Two different OCT devices were used: DRI-OCT Triton Swept Source (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) and XR Avanti SD-OCT (Optovue, Fremont, CA, USA). All patients showed hyper-reflective lesions at the level of ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers more prominently at the papillomacular bundle in both eyes (figure). Results of OCT-angiography and ganglionar cells complex analysis appeared normal. Furthermore, four patients presented subtle cotton wool spots and microhaemorrhages along the retinal arcade, observed on fundus examination, color fundus photography, and red-free imaging.

The EAGG deems it appropriate, in terms of the risk–benefit ratio, to remotely start a pharmacological treatment if the three following conditions are satisfied. First, the individual with ADHD should not have a personal history of shortness of breath on exertion compared with peers; fainting on exertion or in response to fright or noise; excessive palpitations, breathlessness or syncope (at rest or after exercise) or palpitations that are rapid, regular, and start and stop suddenly (fleeting occasional bumps are usually ectopic and do not need investigation); chest pain suggesting cardiac origin; or any previously documented hypertension, congenital heart abnormality, previous cardiac surgery, or underlying condition that increases the risk of having a structural cardiac disorder (eg, genetic conditions or multisystemic disorders).2National Institute for Health and Care ExcellenceAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder: diagnosis and management, NICE guideline [NG87].https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/NG87Date: Sept 13, 2019Date accessed: May 6, 2020Google Scholar The second condition is that the individual with ADHD does not have a family history of early (<40 years) sudden death in a first-degree relative suggesting cardiac disease. Finally, the patient must have baseline monitoring before initiation; blood pressure and heart rate can be measured by a family member or another person remotely (with telephonic assistance, if needed) on three separate occasions (details are provided in the appendix of our previous Comment1Cortese S Asherson P Sonuga-Barke E et al.ADHD management during the COVID-19 pandemic: guidance from the European ADHD Guidelines Group.Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2020;  (published online April 17.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30110-3SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFScopus (0)Google Scholar). If the first or second conditions are not satisfied, a referral to a cardiologist should be made before starting the pharmacological treatment. If only the third condition (baseline monitoring) is not satisfied, the prescriber will need to evaluate the risks and benefits of a face-to-face assessment in the context of the severity of ADHD symptoms, and the impact on the patient and the family. As detailed in our previous 2013 guidance,3Cortese S Holtmann M Banaschewski T et al.Practitioner review: current best practice in the management of adverse events during treatment with ADHD medications in children and adolescents.J Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2013; 54: 227-246CrossrefPubMedScopus (152)Google Scholar if persistent tachycardia or a history suggestive of arrhythmia or familial risk is identified, it is appropriate to request a 24-h electrocardiogram (ECG), rather than a standard, 12-lead ECG. The EAGG considers that, given the current circumstances, in the absence of risk factors described in the first and second conditions, a cardiac auscultation should not be mandatory before starting a medication for ADHD. The declaration of interests remains the same as in the original Comment.

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of emerging studies reporting gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury in patients with COVID-19 on the basis of disease severity, age group, and geographical region. We also explored the disease course of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases on April 4, 2020 (updated April 10, 2020) for articles published from Jan 1, 2020, using the keywords “coronavirus”, “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “novel coronavirus”, “nCoV”, “2019-nCoV”, and “COVID-19.” Considering the urgency of the topic and the need to increase the sensitivity of the search, a grey literature search was done using the same keywords on Google Scholar to capture the most recently published articles. Furthermore, COVID-19 publications in the WHO database of publications, The Lancet COVID-19 Resource Centre, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, BMJ, Gastroenterology, Gut, American Journal of Gastroenterology, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were screened for potentially relevant publications, included accepted pre-proof publications. Additional articles were retrieved by screening the reference lists of included studies and from the archives of the reviewers. The literature search was restricted to articles published in English. One of the reviewers (YQ) with experience in database searches designed the search strategy, which was subsequently revised by other authors. Because of the large number of records identified from the grey literature, the Google Scholar search was limited to titles. However, no additional limits were applied in the PubMed, Embase, or Web of Science searches. Records were managed with EndNote (version X9.0) to exclude duplicates. Eligible studies reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients. Given that preprint papers in databases such as bioRvix and medRvix were not peer-reviewed, we did not include papers found in such databases in our analysis to avoid any potential misinformation being disseminated. The following studies were excluded: duplicate publications; reviews; editorials; single case reports; studies pertaining to other coronavirus-related illnesses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and small case series (<10 cases). Two reviewers (YQ, J-SH) independently screened the titles and abstracts according to these eligibility criteria. Disagreement was discussed with another author (RM) and subsequently resolved via consensus. Two reviewers (J-SH, J-YT) independently rated the quality of included studies using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Case Series Studies.13National Heart, Lung, and Blood InstituteStudy quality assessment tools.http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/study-quality-assessment-toolsDate accessed: February 16, 2020Google Scholar Any disagreement was resolved by the third senior reviewer (RM). The two investigators (QY and J-SH) who did the literature search also independently extracted the data from included studies. Disagreements were resolved by a third investigator (RM) or by consensus. We extracted the following variables: author; date; study design; country; patient demographics; number of participants in severe and non-severe disease groups; and prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and belching, together with prevalence of digestive system comorbidities including liver disease and gastrointestinal diseases. Liver injury was defined according to the studies. Patients with abnormal liver test results, such as increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin concentrations, were also classified as having liver injury. Disease severity was defined according to the studies, mainly on the basis of the symptoms present at diagnosis—eg, patients with pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) less than 90%,14Wang Z Yang B Li Q et al.Clinical features of 69 cases with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China.Clin Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online March 16.)DOI:10.1093/cid/ciaa272Google Scholar or need of intensive care unit (ICU) care,15Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (1184)Google Scholar or with acute respiratory distress syndrome16Wu C Chen X Cai Y et al.Risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in Wuhan, China.JAMA Int Med. 2020;  (published online March 13.)DOI:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994CrossrefScopus (107)Google Scholar were classified as having severe disease.

To estimate standardised mean difference (SMD) or weighted mean differences, we used two simple formulas proposed by Hozo and colleagues18Hozo SP Djulbegovic B Hozo I Estimating the mean and variance from the median, range, and the size of a sample.BMC Med Res Method. 2005; 5: 13CrossrefPubMedScopus (3153)Google Scholar to estimate the mean using the values of the median, the low and high ends of the range, and the sample size. Odds ratios (OR) were used to describe the ratio of the probability of events occurring in patients with severe versus non-severe COVID-19. Owing to heterogeneity within and between studies, a random-effects model was used to estimate the average effect and its precision, which would give a more conservative estimate of the 95% CI. We used the I2 statistic and Cochran's Q test to assess statistical heterogeneity. A meta-analysis was planned to assess the association of gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury with demographic data, outcomes, and disease characteristics. The meta-analysis was done with the metaprop command of the meta package in R (version 3.2.0) for pooling single-armed rates. We used Stata (version 12.1) with the command metareg (for meta-regression) for the assessment of publication bias, and Review Manager (version 5.3) for all other analyses. Funnel-plot asymmetry as proposed by Egger and colleagues19Egger M Smith G Schneider M et al.Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test.BMJ. 1997; 315: 629-634CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar was used to investigate the possibility of publication bias. There was no funding source for this study. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 10 206 records were initially identified by our searches.

Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had an increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR 2·96 [95% CI 1·17–7·48]; p=0·020) and liver injury (2·71 [1·52–4·83]; p=0·0007; appendix p 18). However, the pooled rates of discharge (OR 0·72 [95% CI 0·37–1·41]; p=0·34; figure 4), length of hospital stay (SMD 0·22 [95% CI 0·14–0 ·58]; p=0·11), and mortality (OR 1·21 [95% CI 0·68–2·16]; p=0·52; n=1300 patients and n=107 deaths; I2=8%; figure 4) were similar between patients with and without gastrointestinal symptoms. We analysed the difference in gastrointestinal symptoms between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 (figure 5). Patients with severe disease were more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with those with non-severe disease (OR 1·60 [95% CI 1·09–2·36]; p=0·020; I2=44%). More specifically, a higher risk of having abdominal pain (7·10 [1·93–26·07]; p=0·010; I2=0) was observed in patients with severe disease than in those with non-severe disease. However, we found no significant difference between patients with severe and non-severe disease in loss of appetite (2·83 [0·92–8·69]; p=0·10; I2=61%), diarrhoea (1·22 [0·81–1·84]; p=0·22; I2=0), or nausea or vomiting (1·23 [0·69–2·19]; p=0·43, I2=34%).Figure 5Gastrointestinal symptoms according to COVID-19 severity (severe vs non-severe)Show full captionOdds ratio calculated with Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model.View Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) Odds ratio calculated with Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model.

Liver damage indices, including ALT, and AST, and total bilirubin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with severe disease than in those with non-severe disease (appendix p 19).

We further analysed the differences between patients in Hubei (the place of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, n=4009) versus those outside of Hubei province (n=2677). The incidence of overall gastrointestinal symptoms at diagnosis (17% [95% CI 10–28] vs 9% [6–14]; p=0·078) was similar between the two groups. We found a higher proportion of patients in Hubei presenting with nausea or vomiting compared with those outside of Hubei (appendix p 11). Other symptoms including diarrhoea and loss of appetite were similar between patients in Hubei and outside Hubei (appendix p 11). However, we found a higher risk of liver injury in patients in Hubei compared with those outside of Hubei (21% [95% CI 4–59] vs 10% [4–25]; p<0·0001). This trend was further confirmed by the finding that a larger proportion of patients in Hubei had increased ALT, AST, and total bilirubin concentrations compared with those of patients outside of Hubei (appendix p 11). We further analysed whether digestive symptoms varied between adult (n=6420) and paediatric patients (n=266). Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea and nausea or vomiting were similar between the two groups (appendix p 11). Similarly, children with COVID-19 had a similar risk of liver injury to that of adult patients (10% [95% CI 4–22] vs 18% [8–35]; p=0·32). However, children were less likely to present with increased ALT compared with adult patients (appendix p 11). Significant publication bias was found by both funnel plot and Egger test (p<0·0001) for gastrointestinal symptoms (appendix p 20) but not for liver injury (p=0·18; data not shown). An increasing number of studies have reported the involvement of the digestive system in patients with COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the pooled prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury in patients with COVID-19. Overall, gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in 15% of patients with COVID-19 and liver injury in 19% of patients. As the severity of the disease increases, digestive symptoms and liver injury become more pronounced. About 10% of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms alone without respiratory features; these patients have delayed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms have increased risk of severe or critical disease, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, some patients have initially presented with abdominal symptoms without fever or respiratory manifestations.58Song Y Liu P Shi X et al.SARS-CoV-2 induced diarrhoea as onset symptom in patient with COVID-19.Gut. 2020;  (published online March 5.)DOI:10.1136/gutjnl-2020-320891CrossrefScopus (13)Google Scholar In a large multicentre study12Pan L Mu M Ren H et al.Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms in Hubei, China: a descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study.Am J Gastroenterol. 2020;  (published April 14.)DOI:10.14309/ajg.0000000000000620CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar of 204 patients with COVID-19 in three heavily affected hospitals during the initial outbreak in China, 103 (50%) patients presented with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint.

Only one autopsy report with details of gastrointestinal pathology has been published in an 85-year-old man with COVID-19, which showed segmental dilatation and stenosis in the small intestine.64Liu Q Wang R Qu G et al.Macroscopic autopsy findings in a patient with COVID-19.J Forensic Med. 2020; 36 (in Chinese).: 1-3Google Scholar Further studies are needed to clarify whether this finding is secondary to COVID-19 or a pre-existing gastrointestinal comorbidity. In addition to digestive symptoms, patients with COVID-19 are also at risk of developing liver injury. Studies have shown that patients had varying degrees of liver function abnormalities—the incidence ranged from 1% to 53%—mainly indicated by abnormal ALT and AST concentrations, accompanied by slightly increased bilirubin concentrations. Albumin was decreased in severe cases (around 26·3–30·9 g/L).32Chen N Zhou M Dong X et al.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 507-513SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (641)Google Scholar Our findings indicate that one in five patients will develop liver function abnormalities, especially in patients with severe disease, thus close attention should be paid to liver dysfunction when treating patients with COVID-19 over the hospitalisation period. Liver injury was characterised by slight increases in hepatocyte-related enzymes, including ALT and AST. Cholangiocyte-related enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, were also reported to be slightly increased in a few patients.65Zhang C Shi L Wang FS Liver injury in COVID-19: management and challenges.Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2020; 5: 428-430SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (24)Google Scholar Studies on the exact mechanism of COVID-19-related liver injury are scarce.

A link between gastrointestinal involvement and disease severity of COVID-19 has been proposed.

In 99 patients who presented with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint, a longer time from onset to admission was observed compared with patients without digestive symptoms (9·0 days vs 7·3 days). As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more numerous. Patients without digestive symptoms were more likely to be cured and discharged than were patients with digestive symptoms (60% vs 34%).12Pan L Mu M Ren H et al.Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms in Hubei, China: a descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study.Am J Gastroenterol. 2020;  (published April 14.)DOI:10.14309/ajg.0000000000000620CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar This finding was consistent with the study from Wang and colleagues,33Wang D Hu B Hu C et al.Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Feb 7.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.1585CrossrefScopus (700)Google Scholar who found that patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have abdominal pain and loss of appetite compared with non-ICU patients.33Wang D Hu B Hu C et al.Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Feb 7.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.1585CrossrefScopus (700)Google Scholar We did subgroup analyses to investigate the difference in gastrointestinal symptoms between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19.

We found that patients presenting with initial gastrointestinal symptoms only had longer duration from illness onset to hospital admission. The rate of severe or critical illness was markedly increased in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms than in those without. Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms also had an increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. No significant difference was seen when considering pooled rates of discharge, length of hospital stay, and rates of death between patients with and without gastrointestinal symptoms. This finding might be due to the somewhat low incidence of each event. Moreover, the risk of severe disease was not increased among patients with COVID-19 with existing gastrointestinal or liver-related comorbidities compared with patients without such comorbidities. Thus, newly presenting gastrointestinal symptoms rather the existing digestive comorbidities were predictive of severe disease course. Altogether, our findings support the importance of early inclusion of symptoms such as diarrhoea in the diagnosis of COVID-19. The characteristics of patients with COVID-19 outside of Hubei might differ from those of patients in Hubei. An early study including 80 cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu province showed that patients with COVID-19 exhibited milder or more moderate symptoms and a lower proportion of liver dysfunction compared with patients in Wuhan.38Wu J Liu J Zhao X et al.Clinical characteristics of imported cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province: a multicenter descriptive study.Clin Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online Feb 29.)DOI:10.1093/cid/ciaa199Google Scholar Our subgroup analysis suggested that no difference existed in the rate of overall gastrointestinal symptoms between patients within Hubei and those outside. Patients in Hubei had a higher risk of presenting with abnormal liver function than did those outside of Hubei. One explanation is that Hubei might have had more patients with severe disease compared with outside of Hubei, which might result in the higher percentage of patients with abnormal liver function in Hubei. However, the studies included in our analysis did not show significant differences in the proportion of patients with severe disease between Hubei and outside of Hubei (data not shown). Thus this geographic difference needs to be further investigated in future studies. A few paediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported and associated clinical features have yet to be fully investigated.

First, an assessment of the methodological quality showed deficiencies in the studies assessed—all 35 studies included were considered to be of low quality. Second, because of insufficient data reported in the original publications, we could not assess the effects of other factors, such as sex, age, and comorbidities, on the rate of gastrointestinal symptoms at diagnosis and risk of liver injury. Third, the criteria for severe COVID-19 differed among studies, which might have contributed to the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis. Last, significant heterogeneity and publication bias were observed in our study for estimating the prevalence of digestive system symptoms. After reviewing each study, the non-specific symptom of appetite loss and two studies40Luo S Zhang X Xu H Don't overlook digestive symptoms in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2020;  (published online March 20.)DOI: 10.1016/j.cgh.2020.03.043SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFGoogle Scholar,  49Han C Duan C Zhang S et al.Digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity: clinical presentation, stool viral RNA testing, and outcomes.Am J Gastroenterol. 2020;  (published online April 15.)DOI:10.14309/ajg.0000000000000664CrossrefGoogle Scholar that were focused on patients with gastrointestinal symptoms contributed to most of the heterogeneity. When these studies were excluded from the analysis, the pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was with modest heterogeneity. The pooled rates of the other three symptoms (nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain) were similar to our original results, with only mild or modest heterogeneity. In conclusion, our results suggest that digestive symptoms and liver injury are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19. Compared with patients with non-severe disease, those with severe COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury. Patients in Hubei had a similar risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms but higher risk of liver injury than did those outside of Hubei. Children with COVID-19 had a similar risk of gastrointestinal symptoms to that of adult patients. A tenth of patients with COVID-19 might present only with gastrointestinal symptoms without respiratory symptoms; such patients could have delayed diagnosis. Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms have a tendency to develop severe or critical disease and have a poor disease course. Increased attention should be paid to the care of this unique group of patients. Contributors RM and M-HC conceived the study. SG, M-HC, and RM supervised the overall study.

Although most patients presented with fever or respiratory symptoms, for six patients, only digestive symptoms were present during the whole course of disease.4Pan L Mu M Yang P et al.Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms in Hubei, China: a descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study.Am J Gastroenterol. 2020;  (published online April 14.)DOI:10.14309/ajg.0000000000000620CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar In The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ren Mao and colleagues5Mao R Qiu Y He J-S et al.Manifestations and prognosis of gastrointestinal and liver involvement in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2020;  (published online May 12.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30126-6Google Scholar report findings of a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from 35 studies, including 6686 patients with COVID-19. In 29 studies (6064 cases) reporting gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19, the pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was 15% (95% CI 10–21), the most common of which were nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and anorexia. Of note, the authors report that around 10% of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms without respiratory features when infected with SARS-CoV-2. These patients were more likely to have a delayed diagnosis, leading to potential problems for themselves and individuals with whom they came into contact. Together with respiratory transmission, there is potential for faecal–oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been documented in faecal samples. For example, Wu and colleagues6Wu Y Guo C Tang L et al.Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in faecal samples.Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2020; 5: 434-435SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (20)Google Scholar showed that 41 (55%) of 74 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive faecal samples; whereas the respiratory samples of these patients remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for a mean of 16·7 days, their faecal samples remained positive for a mean of 27·9 days. One patient had RNA-positive faecal samples for 33 days after their respiratory samples became RNA-negative, and another patient tested RNA-positive in their faecal sample for 47 days after symptom onset. The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms was not correlated with faecal sample viral RNA positivity and severity of disease was also not correlated with extended duration of faecal sample viral RNA positivity. Wang and colleagues7Wang W Xu Y Gao R et al.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different types of clinical specimens.JAMA. 2020;  (published online March 11.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.3786CrossrefScopus (86)Google Scholar examined different types of clinical specimen in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (1070 specimens from 205 patients of mean age 44 years) using RT-PCR, and found that 126 (32%) of 398 pharyngeal swabs (126 of 398) and 44 (29%) of 153 faecal specimens (44 of 153) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The authors cultured four SARS-CoV-2 positive faecal specimens with high copy numbers and detected live virus using electron microscopy detection. These findings imply that in some patients, although SARS-CoV-2 has been cleared in the respiratory tract, the virus continues to replicate in the gastrointestinal tract and could be shed in faeces. However, two major questions remain to be answered. First, how long can SARS-CoV-2 survive in faeces? van Doremalen and colleagues8van Doremalen N Bushmaker T Morris DH et al.Aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 1564-1567CrossrefPubMedScopus (165)Google Scholar analysed the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on various surfaces, and found that the virus remained viable in aerosols for 3 h. The viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces depended on the type of surface. In the simulated environment in the laboratory, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was detected after 4 h on copper and after 24 h on cardboard. SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel, with viable virus detectable for up to 72 h. However, there are currently no data showing how long SARS-CoV-2 remains viable in faeces. Second, why can SARS-CoV-2 continue to replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of some patients after it has been cleared from the respiratory tract? Xu and colleagues9Xu Y Li X Zhu B et al.Characteristics of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential evidence for persistent fecal viral shedding.Nat Med. 2020; 26: 502-505CrossrefPubMedScopus (26)Google Scholar studied the characteristics of ten paediatric patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and found that eight (80%) of ten patients (eight of ten) persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal tests became negative, which was different from the ratio (41 [55%]of 74) in adults reported by Wu and colleagues.6Wu Y Guo C Tang L et al.Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in faecal samples.Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2020; 5: 434-435SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (20)Google Scholar There are some differences in the microenvironment between adult and paediatric gastrointestinal tracts.10Ringel-Kulka T Cheng J Ringel Y et al.Intestinal microbiota in healthy U.S. young children and adults—a high throughput microarray analysis.PLoS One. 2013; 8e64315CrossrefPubMedScopus (74)Google Scholar Is it possible that the complex intestinal flora residing in the gastrointestinal tract might protect SARS-CoV-2 from the human immune system? The characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 are more insidious than the respiratory symptoms, making them easy to overlook. However, some patients might have only gastrointestinal symptoms during the whole course of this disease, and some continue to shed the virus in faeces, despite respiratory samples testing negative. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether these patients represent a potentially overlooked means of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We declare no competing interests.

In The Lancet Global Health, Timothy Roberton and colleagues1Roberton T Carter ED Chou VB et al.Early estimates of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study.Lancet Glob Health. 2020;  (published online May 12.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30229-1Google Scholar present startling new evidence on the potential rise in maternal and child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries if essential health services are disrupted as a result of COVID-19. Building on lessons learned from previous outbreaks of Ebola virus disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the authors estimate a devastating increase in the numbers of maternal and child deaths resulting from reductions in routine health service coverage. Left unchecked, these reductions (due to, for example, disruptions in medical supply chains or the availability of human and financial resources) along with declines in the uptake of health services by communities fearful of infection will be more catastrophic for mothers and children than COVID-19 itself. The projection of an additional 1·2 million child deaths and 56 700 maternal deaths in 118 countries if coverage of essential services drops by around 45% for 6 months is alarming. It is also avoidable if we act now. These findings reinforce the multi-part approach that UNICEF has adopted from the start of the outbreak.2UNICEFCoronavirus disease (COVID-19): resources for practitioners.https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/covid-19-resources-practitionersDate accessed: May 7, 2020Google Scholar First, we are working to prevent COVID-19 transmission and treat those who fall sick. Second, we are working to address the effects of the policy responses aimed at containing the spread, including maintaining routine health services for all children and mothers, ensuring continuity of learning, keeping mothers and children safe and protected from violence, and scaling up social protections to keep children and their families afloat. Third, we are working to strengthen the systems that underpin all of these services. The evidence is already showing the negative effects of COVID-19, and the unprecedented measures to contain it, on maternal and child health. Children are at risk not only of infection, but also of losing or being separated from family members and caregivers. Mothers and children are affected by the disruption of essential preventative and curative support and supplies resulting from suspensions in services and transportation systems, as well as by financial constraints.3UNPolicy brief: the impact of COVID-19 on women.https://www.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2020/policy-brief-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-women-en.pdf?la=en&vs=1406Date: April 9, 2020Date accessed: May 7, 2020Google Scholar,  4UNPolicy brief: the impact of COVID-19 on children.https://unsdg.un.org/sites/default/files/2020-04/160420_Covid_Children_Policy_Brief.pdfDate: April 15, 2020Date accessed: May 7, 2020Google Scholar Constrained access to clinics, schools, social workers, water, and sanitation is a particular threat to the most vulnerable populations, and the lack of child protection and broader social services is particularly harmful to women and children in need of safety. Looming above all of these concerns is the economic impact of both the pandemic control measures governments are taking and the predicted knock-on effects of the projected global recession:5UNShared responsibility, global solidarity: responding to socio-economic impacts of COVID-19.https://unsdg.un.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/SG-Report-Socio-Economic-Impact-of-Covid19.pdfDate: March, 2020Date accessed: May 7, 2020Google Scholar reduced incomes, public and private debt, and reduced access to goods will affect many aspects of household health and nutrition. In short, these effects threaten to roll back the hard-won progress countries have made in recent decades. As a global community, overcoming the negative impacts of the pandemic will require focus on six key areas of action and investment. First, we must keep children healthy and well nourished by providing supplies and protective equipment, which must reach health workers and affected communities. At the same time, life-saving maternal, newborn, and child health services, routine vaccinations, and access to HIV treatment must be maintained. Second, we must urgently prioritise funding and support for maintaining and strengthening water, sanitation, and hygiene. The combined work of governments and the private sector will be required to increase the practice of handwashing across the board, tapping into local innovation and global partnerships. Third, learning and connectedness among children must be maintained, and support must be given to governments to provide no-technology, low-technology, and digital solutions. Already before the crisis, UNICEF was working on an initiative6UNICEFUNICEF's approach to digital health.https://www.unicef.org/innovation/sites/unicef.org.innovation/files/2018-11/UNICEF%27s%20Approach%20to%20Digital%20Health%20released%2022%20Oct%202018.pdfDate accessed: May 7, 2020Google Scholar with partners to extend digital infrastructure to ensure all children can learn, no matter who and where they are, and this work needs to be brought quickly to scale. Fourth, we must recognise parents and families as essential front-line workers. They need support through social protection measures that include cash and nutrition support. Fiscal response packages must target women and children. More than ever, everyone needs access to paid family leave, paid sick leave, and childcare. Fifth, services to prevent and address gender-based violence—including counselling and support—must be designed and delivered. These services should be designated as essential, and moved online. The current crisis makes women and children even more vulnerable to violence.3UNPolicy brief: the impact of COVID-19 on women.https://www.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2020/policy-brief-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-women-en.pdf?la=en&vs=1406Date: April 9, 2020Date accessed: May 7, 2020Google Scholar Finally, we must not forget about refugee and migrant children or children affected by conflict. An effective COVID-19 response is one that includes all children in a country—whatever their status. As we think through new and innovative ways to support children and their families, it is encouraging to see that many local initiatives have already begun.7UNICEFCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) information centre.https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/covid-19Date accessed: May 7, 2020Google Scholar These initiatives push us all to consider the new opportunities that this crisis creates for communities to recover better, build stronger systems, and orient these services to reach all people, rich and poor alike. This kind of long-term thinking can help us to prevent further loss of life from COVID-19 and to reduce the effects of the global recession, while making progress towards the healthier, more equal, resilient, and sustainable future envisioned in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This future is not automatic. It begins by heeding the findings of models like those presented by Roberton and colleagues, and by realising that the full effects of the disease on health and wellbeing of children reach beyond the immediate illness. These effects threaten global progress in a number of areas, as well as the lives and rights of a generation of children. By working together as a global community, we can learn from these data and invest in future-oriented solutions now, and spur a lasting recovery that will benefit children and communities for decades to come.

In many low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), the disease is rapidly spreading amid numerous endemic health problems such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, malnutrition, and frequent outbreaks of viral infections with high associated mortality. All this occurs in a context of weak health infrastructures that can barely cope with the aforementioned existing health challenges.1Makoni M Africa prepares for coronavirus.Lancet. 2020; 395: 483SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (4)Google Scholar WHO is already urging countries to ensure the continuity of health services and programmes, so that even when overwhelmed with the response to COVID-19, the other programmes will be able to continue as effectively as possible. However, fear of the unknown and extensive misinformation are creating a breeding ground that may reverse the progress achieved in basic health indicators such as maternal and child mortality during the past 20 years in many LMICs. In The Lancet Global Health, Timothy Roberton and colleagues report the findings of a modelling study to estimate the indirect effects of the coronavirus pandemic on maternal and child mortality in LMICs.2Roberton T Carter ED Chou VB et al.Early estimates of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study.Lancet Glob Health. 2020;  (published online May 12.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30229-1Google Scholar As previously done for the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, they use the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to estimate the additional indirect maternal and under-5 child deaths that could be indirectly attributed to COVID-19 pandemic response strategies.3Sochas L Channon AA Nam S Counting indirect crisis-related deaths in the context of a low-resilience health system: the case of maternal and neonatal health during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone.Health Policy Plann. 2017; 32: 32-39CrossrefScopus (9)Google Scholar They model three possible scenarios of reduction in the coverage of essential maternal and child health services and of an increased prevalence of wasting over 3, 6, and 12 months. They estimate that reductions of around 45% for 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths.2Roberton T Carter ED Chou VB et al.Early estimates of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study.Lancet Glob Health. 2020;  (published online May 12.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30229-1Google Scholar They estimate that these figures would represent a 9·8–44·7% increase in under-5 deaths per month, and an 8·3–38·6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries included in their analysis.2Roberton T Carter ED Chou VB et al.Early estimates of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study.Lancet Glob Health. 2020;  (published online May 12.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30229-1Google Scholar Elsewhere, the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and newborn health in India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan over 12 months was estimated using the same LiST.4Stein D Ward K Cantelmo C Estimating the potential impact of COVID-19 on mothers and newborns in low- and middle-income countries.https://medium.com/@HealthPolicyPlus/estimating-the-potential-impact-of-covid-19-on-mothers-and-newborns-in-low-and-middle-income-3a7887e4a0ffDate accessed: May 5, 2020Google Scholar However, different assumptions and scenarios were used, yielding an estimate of 766 180 additional deaths (31 980 maternal deaths, 395 440 newborn deaths, and 338 760 stillbirths) across these four countries alone, which would correspond to a 31% increase in mortality. The comprehensive analysis by Roberton and colleagues provides estimates of maternal and child deaths under three scenarios of differing severity and duration, which may help policy makers to adjust the response to the pandemic.5Bong CL Brasher C Chikumba E McDougall R Mellin-Olsen J Enright A The COVID-19 pandemic: effects on low and middle-income countries.Anesth Analg. 2020;  (published online April 1.)DOI:10.1213/ANE.0000000000004846CrossrefScopus (0)Google Scholar The authors acknowledge the limitations of their work, among which is the fact that they applied the same assumptions for the 118 countries included in the analysis. The authors also justify the exclusion of HIV infection in their analysis due to the complexity of prevention and treatment delivery systems and to the low contribution of HIV to global child deaths. Nevertheless, since HIV infection is both a leading cause of death in women of reproductive age and responsible for 6–20% of maternal deaths, we think it should be considered when estimating HIV effects on maternal mortality.6Lathrop E Jamieson DJ Danel I HIV and maternal mortality.Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2014; 127: 213-215CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar,  7UNAIDSForty years into the HIV epidemic, AIDS remains the leading cause of death of women of reproductive age—UNAIDS calls for bold action.https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2020/march/20200305_weve-got-the-powerDate accessed: May 5, 2020Google Scholar The geographical overlap with the HIV epidemic is particularly important when analysing data from southern Africa, where up to 30% of pregnant women may be HIV-infected.8Gonzalez R Munguambe K Aponte J et al.High HIV prevalence in a southern semi-rural area of Mozambique: a community-based survey.HIV Med. 2012; 13: 581-588CrossrefPubMedScopus (62)Google Scholar This study raises awareness of the potential indirect effects of the pandemic in the most vulnerable populations from the most disadvantaged countries worldwide. The case of antenatal care (ANC) illustrates this problem. In 2016, WHO launched new guidelines recommending at least eight ANC contacts during pregnancy, based on evidence that this increased number of contacts is associated with reduced perinatal mortality.9WHOWHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience.https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2020/march/20200305_weve-got-the-powerDate accessed: May 5, 2020Google Scholar In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, some African countries are changing routine ANC guidelines to space (and de facto reduce) the number of contacts to one every 3 months instead of monthly visits, or delaying the postpartum visit to 3 months after delivery (therefore no longer constituting a postpartum visit).10Ministério da SaúdeDirecção Nacional de Saúde Pública.

The implications for maternal and neonatal health are likely to be significant. When not tailored to the given context, public health measures can lead to unintended harm that is potentially greater than the one that it intended to avoid. Preventing these indirect effects is especially important in low-resilience health systems. The challenge is how to contain the effects of epidemics while understanding its effects on maternal and child health and ensuring that essential health services are maintained. National programmes should keep providing core maternal and child interventions even with the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Continued provision of these interventions is essential to save maternal and child lives. We declare no competing interests.",2020-05-12 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease.MethodsIn this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK–CALIBER). We report prevalence of underlying conditions defined by Public Health England guidelines (from March 16, 2020) in individuals aged 30 years or older registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, using validated, openly available phenotypes for each condition. We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 1·5, 2·0, and 3·0 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0·001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), and do nothing (80%).

We estimated that more than 20% of the study population are in the high-risk category, of whom 13·7% were older than 70 years and 6·3% were aged 70 years or younger with at least one underlying condition. 1-year mortality in the high-risk population was estimated to be 4·46% (95% CI 4·41–4·51). Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions. In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 1·5, four with an RR of 2·0, and seven with an RR of 3·0. In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18 374 excess deaths with an RR of 1·5, 36 749 with an RR of 2·0, and 73 498 with an RR of 3·0. In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146 996 excess deaths with an RR of 1·5, 293 991 with an RR of 2·0, and 587 982 with an RR of 3·0.InterpretationWe provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates. These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions.

Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions. In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 1·5, four with an RR of 2·0, and seven with an RR of 3·0. In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18 374 excess deaths with an RR of 1·5, 36 749 with an RR of 2·0, and 73 498 with an RR of 3·0. In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146 996 excess deaths with an RR of 1·5, 293 991 with an RR of 2·0, and 587 982 with an RR of 3·0. We provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates. These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions. Countries should assess the overall (direct and indirect) effects of the pandemic on excess mortality. National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Health Data Research UK. Excess deaths from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic might arise both in those infected (direct effects), as well as those affected (indirectly, not infected) by altered access to health services; the physical, psychological, and social effects of distancing; and economic changes. Understanding the effect of COVID-19 on mortality during this emergency requires modelling of an infectious disease, as well as wider medical and societal changes. One way of estimating and monitoring excess mortality is to compare observed numbers of deaths with those expected based on the background (pre-COVID-19) mortality risks in the population.1Spiegelhalter D How much ‘normal’ risk does Covid represent?

The UK has relatively high case fatality rates (8·2%), but mortality rates are unknown at this stage of the pandemic because testing is more common among sicker patients who are admitted to hospital (the context where most testing has been done) rather than milder cases.

For example, an RR of 2·0 for COVID-19 describes a doubling of the risk of mortality in individuals infected with or affected by COVID-19 versus their background risk of death. A definition of COVID-19-related mortality relevant to the emergency includes both deaths among those infected (direct), and deaths among those affected by health service, societal, and economic changes (indirect).

Extrapolating from our English sample to the whole UK population, we estimate 8·43 million people are in the high-risk group, of whom 5·77 million are older than 70 years of age, and 2·66 million have one or more underlying condition and are 70 years or younger). Based on the background (pre-COVID-19) 1-year mortality that we observed in the CALIBER data of 4·46% for this group, 376 001 deaths would occur in the UK. Using these estimates, numbers of people at high-risk other countries were 4·70 million in Canada, 8·31 million in France, 10·46 million in Germany, 7·51 million in Italy, 1·28 million in Sweden, and 41·76 million in the USA (table).TableProjected deaths in 1 year in high-risk group pre-COVID-19 infection across countriesGeneral population (millions)High-risk group (millions)Baseline number of deaths in 1 year in high-risk groupTotalOlder than 30 yearsOlder than 70 years70 years or younger with underlying conditionTotal at high riskCanada37·0623·443·221·484·70209 732England55·9835·414·872·247·10316 805France65·5041·435·692·628·31370 681Germany82·4052·127·163·2910·46466 322Italy59·2037·455·152·377·51335 028Sweden10·106·390·880·401·2857 158UK66·4442·035·772·668·43376 001USA329·10208·1728·6013·1641·761 862 459All assumptions are based on England (CALIBER) estimates of 63·25% of the total population older than 30 years, 13·74% older than 70 years, 6·32% 70 years or younger with an underlying condition, and 20·06% total high-risk group; and a 1-year mortality (Kaplan-Meier) for the total high-risk group of 4·46%.

Using NHS records, we provide an initial population-based study estimating plausible ranges of excess COVID-19-related mortality in England. We provide estimates of the prevalence and background (pre-COVID-19) 1-year mortality risks according to underlying conditions at different ages in women and men, sharing these estimates in online materials, and the disease definitions in the HDR UK–CALIBER portal. These are major parameters in understanding the emergency, and the best source of estimates comes from electronic records, with implications for policy makers, clinicians, and the public. Our results support rigorous, sustained implementation of suppression measures.25Cyranoski D What China's coronavirus response can teach the rest of the world.Nature. 2020; 579: 479-480CrossrefPubMedScopus (4)Google Scholar With our definition of overall excess deaths, combining direct and indirect effects among those with and without infection, it is reasonable to consider that a high (eg, 80%) proportion of the population might be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not know what the relative impact of excess deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic will be over a 1-year period in any country. However, clinical and societal concern internationally is that it is not a regular seasonal flu. We show that if the pandemic is associated with an RR of 1·5, then there will be 18 374 excess deaths in a mitigation scenario and 146 996 excess deaths in a do nothing scenario; compared with two deaths under a full suppression scenario. A doubling of the risk is worth considering because of uncertainty regarding the actual risk associated with COVID-19 and mounting health-care burden around the world. This RR of 2·0 would result in 36 749 excess deaths in a mitigation scenario and 293 991 excess deaths in a do nothing scenario. A major concern is that relative risks will rise in a non-linear fashion with infection rates if health systems become overwhelmed by critically ill patients. Thus, at high infection rates, relative risks for excess mortality would almost certainly be much higher—and these non-linear interactions are a subject for further modelling. The impact of COVID-19 is likely to be much greater if there is poor compliance with social isolation policies and low treatment and health-system capacity. The RR of COVID-19 infection and the case fatality rate have been estimated,21Baud D Qi X Nielsen-Saines K Musso D Pomar L Favre G Real estimates of mortality following COVID-19 infection.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online March 12.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30195-XSummaryFull TextFull Text PDFGoogle Scholar but the RR for mortality will better capture the impact of infection on individuals and health systems. Even in the RR of 2·0 model, full suppression would lead to virtually no excess mortality, because some patients with underlying conditions would have died over a 1-year period regardless of the COVID-19 outbreak. The prototype online risk calculator allows exploration and visualisation of the age-specific, sex-specific, and underlying condition-specific excess mortality under different assumptions. Near real-time cause-specific mortality, as reported by the Office for National Statistics, ideally on a weekly basis, will greatly aid understanding of the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.10Office for National StatisticsDeaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional: week ending 3 April 2020.https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending3april2020#main-pointsDate: April 14, 2020Date accessed: April 17, 2020Google Scholar Such information can inform timing of exit strategies from lockdown. In future analyses, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disease-specific health-care provision and use should be assessed. We have assumed the same impact (RR) of COVID-19 on excess mortality for each underlying condition—ie, it is the same for a patient with COPD or with morbid obesity. Although a reasonable starting point, this assumption requires testing as empirical data become available. An interaction between different comorbidities almost certainly exists, meaning that some combinations are worse than others, and this factor needs to be investigated. We used a 1-year time period because of concerns regarding second waves of infection and the time needed for health services and the wider socioeconomic disruption to return to a new steady state. Complementary future analyses might usefully address the temporal resolution (daily and weekly) of excess mortality estimates, which are likely to change at different phases of the epidemic; specifically to focus on the first 3 months, extending to 2 years and beyond. We show that by Public Health England criteria, at least 20% of the population falls within the high-risk mortality category for COVID-19: 13·7% based on age older than 70 years (an arbitrary cutoff) and a further 6·3% based on having one or more underlying conditions. We show how policy might consider age in combination with underlying conditions. For example, a man aged 66–70 years with no underlying conditions, who is not currently considered high risk, has a higher background 1-year mortality (1·07%) than that of a woman aged 56–60 years with one underlying condition (0·91%), who is considered high risk. The underlying conditions that we report (cardiovascular diseases, COPD, and diabetes) are known to already be suboptimally managed before COVID-19, with missed opportunities for effective (secondary) preventive interventions common in many countries.26Yusuf S Islam S Chow CK et al.Use of secondary prevention drugs for cardiovascular disease in the community in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries (the PURE study): a prospective epidemiological survey.Lancet. 2011; 378: 1231-1243SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (591)Google Scholar With COVID-19 pressures, these practical actions for clinicians might not be addressed, and chronic disease management care might deteriorate. Primary and secondary health-care workers have an important role in optimising guideline-recommended management of underlying conditions to lower background risk, particularly if shielding or suppression measures are to be sustained over long periods—eg, 3 or more months. The prototype online risk calculator might be relevant for clinicians to prioritise such patients. In England, 1·5 million individuals have been identified based on national health records as being extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, on the basis of one of a wide range of factors (including pregnancy with serious heart disease, chemotherapy, solid organ transplants, and cystic fibrosis).12Public Health EnglandGuidance on social distancing for everyone in the UK.https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adultsDate: March 30, 2020Date accessed: April 16, 2020Google Scholar These patients have been identified and are being individually supported (eg, with food parcels and medicine delivery) for the life-changing intervention of 12 weeks of shielding. Such policies, which require actionable knowledge across multiple diseases have few, if any, historical precedents; only countries with nationwide health-system data can implement such policies. The list was probably designed to identify patients who are most susceptible to infection or have a degree of immunosuppression, which cannot be quantified in a standardised way. The prognosis research strategy initiative has previously made recommendations for consistent approaches to understanding prognosis across multiple diseases and clinical specialties, the importance of which is highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.27Hemingway H Croft P Perel P et al.Prognosis research strategy (PROGRESS) 1: a framework for researching clinical outcomes.BMJ. 2013; 346e5595CrossrefPubMedScopus (208)Google Scholar We found that patients with conditions not on the vulnerable patient list may be at as high or greater mortality than those who are. For example, cardiovascular disease is not on the vulnerable patient list and has a 1-year mortality of 6%; we found that the 1-year mortality risk of people with two or more conditions was 11%—but multiple morbidities co-occurring in the same individual do not yet qualify as extremely vulnerable. A more systematic, transparent understanding is needed of which underlying conditions are important for policy and patients. Further research is required to identify the extent to which patients with other physical conditions, frailty, and mental health conditions as well as those experiencing social exclusion (eg, homeless people and intravenous drug users) might benefit from targeted interventions. We have deposited definitions of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 in the HDR UK–CALIBER open online portal. It is important for reproducible research in COVID-19 that different research groups within and between countries use clinical information from electronic health records in consistent, transparent, and validated ways to define underlying conditions and the COVID-19 syndrome (electronic health record phenotypes). It has previously been shown that in defining one disease—asthma—research groups combine clinical data in more than 60 different ways to reach a definition.28Al Sallakh MA Vasileiou E Rodgers SE Lyons RA Sheikh A Davies GA Defining asthma and assessing asthma outcomes using electronic health record data: a systematic scoping review.Eur Respir J. 2017; 491700204CrossrefPubMedScopus (10)Google Scholar However, few efforts have been made to harmonise definitions of diseases across national electronic health records. To address the COVID-19 pandemic, international efforts are needed to harmonise definitions of underlying conditions and the clinical syndrome and progression of COVID-19 infection using routine clinical health records. We share age-specific (5-year age bands) and sex-specific estimates of prevalence and 1-year mortality for each underlying condition. These population-based estimates might be relevant for other countries, particularly those in which population-based records are neither available nor accessible. As an illustration, we show estimates of excess deaths in different countries if the background (pre-COVID-19) mortality from England were applied. It is known, based on disease-specific registries, that mortality among people with underlying conditions differs between countries, but few studies using electronic health records compare outcomes across countries. In one study, the long-term mortality among patients who had survived a heart attack was broadly consistent across France, Sweden, the UK, and the USA,29Rapsomaniki E Thuresson M Yang E et al.Using big data from health records from four countries to evaluate chronic disease outcomes: a study in 114 364 survivors of myocardial infarction.Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes. 2016; 2: 172-183CrossrefPubMedScopus (0)Google Scholar suggesting that our findings might have international relevance. Like other researchers, we were able to access only a sample of relevant NHS data, covering 5% of the UK population, excluding any detailed information from hospitals. Research is a key part of the COVID-19 response, and the UK Government is already acting to increase publicly accountable access to NHS health and social care data to a large number of researchers, clinicians, and policy makers nationwide. Currently researchers can access only small samples, in which linkage to even simple data on hospital admissions requires multiple approvals and can take years. It is impossible to access NHS data on the COVID-19 epidemic as a nationwide whole (it is fragmented by primary and secondary care and across countries). Despite small networks for critical care,30Harris S Shi S Brealey D et al.Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative (CCHIC): data, tools and methods for reproducible research: a multi-centre UK intensive care database.Int J Med Inform. 2018; 112: 82-89CrossrefPubMedScopus (13)Google Scholar and coronary disease,31Kaura A Panoulas V Glampson B et al.Association of troponin level and age with mortality in 250 000 patients: cohort study across five UK acute care centres.BMJ. 2019; 367l6055CrossrefPubMedScopus (2)Google Scholar there are currently no national efforts to stream real-time, actionable data on COVID-19 care and (non-fatal) outcomes. With public and Government support, the NHS has an opportunity to mobilise its data to create a learning health system needed urgently for COVID-19, in which high-quality clinical information is collected. A system like this would need to include measures of disease severity, which are often absent. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, this system could have far-reaching, long-term benefits for patient care by accelerating knowledge generation and application. We might have underestimated true 1-year mortality risks because physical distancing policies might themselves influence the background mortality risks—people might be less likely to access health and social care, and physical isolation has in many previous studies been shown to be associated with the onset and progression of cardiovascular and other diseases. Underlying diseases, treatment, and health-care use need to be explored in detail in the context of COVID-19. It is not known whether sudden and systematic physical distancing,32Fenichel EP Economic considerations for social distancing and behavioral based policies during an epidemic.J Health Econ. 2013; 32: 440-451CrossrefPubMedScopus (18)Google Scholar particularly if prolonged over months, has different or additional health consequences from those reported from earlier studies of isolation. Understanding how to mitigate the emergency will require accessing and linking data about causes and consequences of the emergency across sectors, including education, economy, and transport. We have presented our findings in a way that begins to be understandable by the general public, because of calls for information that might be relevant to an individual's risk—here defined by age, sex, and presence of an underlying condition.1Spiegelhalter D How much ‘normal’ risk does Covid represent? Medium.https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196Date: March 21, 2020Date accessed: April 16, 2020Google Scholar No authoritative public-facing tools are yet available, but they might provide context, motivation, and support to comply with the multiple changes in daily living that shielding entails. Particularly over prolonged isolation, this could be important given concern about the practical ability of patients to maintain shielding. By contrast with the daily news feed in every country, which reports the numbers of deaths (the numerator), we report a risk: numbers of deaths over 1 year divided by the population who was at risk of dying. Among the public it might not be widely appreciated that 1400 people die on average every day in the UK at baseline (ie, before COVID-19).33BBC NewsCoronavirus: UK deaths double in 24 hours.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51889957Date: March 14, 2020Date accessed: April 16, 2020Google Scholar Of all those people dying within 1 year, it is likely that COVID-19 brings forward the death earlier in the year. In other words, there are competing causes for the mortality. Our study has important limitations. The study was developed over a 72-h period before posting the results on March 22, 2020, the day before the UK Prime Minister announced lockdown. First, our models require further data for their development. Commonly, research using NHS data can take months, and even years, partly because of the multiple steps in accessing such data for research. Specifically, it is important to study a wider range of underlying conditions, a wider range of hospital and critical care admissions, linkage of primary care data to nationally available information on COVID-19 testing, linkage to richer, real-time hospital data, and use of nationwide NHS data. Second, we believe it is both a limitation and a strength that our model is simple and supports public understanding. The assumptions we make can be tested as empirical data become available, such as the Office for National Statistics data.10Office for National StatisticsDeaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional: week ending 3 April 2020.https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending3april2020#main-pointsDate: April 14, 2020Date accessed: April 17, 2020Google Scholar There are many avenues for further modelling to better understand how to target different preventive interventions. An (incomplete) list includes statistical (dynamic models, weekly rates of mortality, and competing risks), public health (disease-specific data for high-risk and extremely vulnerable conditions, regional variation, social deprivation, and ethnicity), clinical (including hospital and critical care admissions), and health service factors (including data on health-care workers and operational features). Health-care professionals, like those involved in this paper, are being redirected to provide priority clinical services during the emergency internationally. We believe an important aspect of emergency response is to support clinical academics to continue to contribute to research into new preventive and treatment options, as they take on new service responsibilities. If the relative risk of COVID-19 on mortality over 1 year were 1·2 (ie, the same magnitude as the winter vs summer mortality excess) then the number of excess deaths would be zero when one in 100 000 individuals are infected (full suppression scenario), 7350 when one in ten are infected (mitigate scenario), and 58 798 when eight in ten are infected (do nothing scenario). However, if the relative risk is doubled to 2·0, then there would be 36 749 deaths in the mitigation scenario and 293 991 deaths in the do nothing scenario. These results should inform targeting of those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions. Contributors AB conceived the research question. SD and HH obtained funding.

According to data from WHO, more than 1 500 000 people live with a transplanted organ worldwide. In the USA, approximately 40 000 patients receive an organ transplant every year, but 120 000 patients remain on a waiting list for transplantation, with 7600 individuals dying annually while waiting for an organ transplant. In Europe and many other countries, patients are affected by a similar scarcity of organs and high death rates while on the waiting list for transplantation. As nations adjust to new realities driven by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many health-care providers, institutions, and patients are concerned about the potential effect that COVID-19 will have on organ donation and transplantation. One concern is that transplant recipients might have greater susceptibility to infection and increased viral burden.2American Society of TransplantationCOVID-19 information.https://www.myast.org/covid-19-informationDate: April 17, 2020Date accessed: April 28, 2020Google Scholar A second concern is that hospitals will not have the resources in terms of staff and equipment to care for recipients after transplantation, who typically need intensive care and multispecialty management. Because of the overwhelming health-care system burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, a pronounced negative effect on worldwide organ donation and transplantation is anticipated but has not been measured. Our objective was to quantify the contemporary effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on organ donation and transplantation in France and the USA. We did nationwide analyses using data on COVID-19 diagnoses from Public Health France and the Center for System Science and Engineering.3Xu B Kraemer MUG on behalf of the Open COVID-19 Data Curation GroupOpen access epidemiological data from the COVID-19 outbreak.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30119-5Google Scholar Organ procurement and transplantation data were obtained from two federal agencies, the National Organ Procurement Agency in France and the United Network for Organ Sharing in the USA.4United Network for Organ SharingTransplant trends.https://unos.org/data/transplant-trends/Date: April 27, 2020Date accessed: April 28, 2020Google Scholar Organ transplantations were counted using mean 5 days moving averages, with stratified analyses done for kidney, liver, heart, and lung. We noted a strong temporal association between the increase in COVID-19 infections and a striking reduction in overall solid-organ transplantation procedures (figure). The effect was seen in France and confirmed in the USA. The overall reduction in deceased donor transplantations since the COVID-19 outbreak was 90·6% in France and 51·1% in the USA, respectively. In both France and the USA, this reduction was mostly driven by kidney transplantation, but a substantial effect was also seen for heart, lung, and liver transplants, all of which provide meaningful improvement in survival probability. In the appendix, the geographical association is shown between areas with COVID-19 clusters and the decrease in organ procurement, showing a significant reduction in transplantation rates even in regions where COVID-19 cases are low, suggesting a global and nationwide effect beyond the local COVID-19 infection prevalence.FigureTrends in COVID-19 spread over time in France and the USA and recovery of organs and solid-organ transplantation procedures from deceased donorsShow full caption(A, C) Number of COVID-19 diagnoses and number of solid organs recovered for transplantation over time in France (A) and the USA (C).

As COVID-19 spreads rapidly across Europe to North America, South America, and other continents, health-care providers and leaders of medical institutions will make difficult decisions about how best to deploy limited medical resources.5Anderson RM Heesterbeek H Klinkenberg D Hollingsworth TD How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?.Lancet. 2020; 395: 931-934Google Scholar These choices could be especially devastating for the thousands of patients in need of an organ transplant. While living donor organ transplants could presumably be rescheduled for a future date, deceased donor organs must be procured immediately or the opportunity is lost. Transplant professionals will need to adapt to these rapidly changing circumstances, provide reassurance to their patients, and remain poised to reinvigorate the valuable transplant infrastructure when the COVID-19 crisis begins to abate. By using the example of organ transplantation, which is a highly regulated field and has a specific centralised day-to-day reporting scheme at a federal level, we show how high-value medical procedures can be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with outcomes for vulnerable patient groups. Furthermore, detailed cartographic mapping of trends in organ donation and transplant activity will enable targeted interventions when the burdens of COVID-19 get lighter. Some organ procurement organisations and their networks will undoubtedly recover more quickly than others through best practices and effective communication with hospitals. Careful mapping will enable public health leaders and transplant organisations to identify areas where transplants have not recovered well and support is needed.

The most typical finding in patients with COVID-19 and coagulopathy is an increased D-dimer concentration, a relatively modest decrease in platelet count, and a prolongation of the prothrombin time. In a series6Guan WJ Ni ZY Hu Y et al.Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 1708-1720Google Scholar of 1099 patients with COVID-19 from China, elevated D-dimer (>0·5 mg/L) was found in 260 (46%) of 560 patients. In another observational study3Tang N Li D Wang X Sun Z Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia.J Thromb Haemost. 2020; 18: 844-847Google Scholar in 183 patients with COVID-19 in China, a mean D-dimer concentration of 2·12 mg/L (range 0·77–5·27) was measured in patients who didn't survive compared to a concentration of 0·61 mg/L (0·35–1·29) in survivors. A third study7Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar found that patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had significantly higher median D-dimer concentrations (2·4 mg/L, IQR 0·6–14·4) than patients who received no ICU care (0·5 mg/L, 0·3–0·8). In another study,8Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062Google Scholar D-dimer on admission greater than 1 mg/L resulted in an 18-times increased risk of death (95% CI 2·6–128·6; p=0·0033). The prothrombin time in patients with severe COVID-19 was shown to be mildly prolonged (15·6 s, range 14·4–16·3) in patients who died versus patients who survived (13·6 s, 13·0–14·3).3Tang N Li D Wang X Sun Z Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia.J Thromb Haemost. 2020; 18: 844-847Google Scholar Of note, these subtle changes might go undetected when the prothrombin time is expressed as international normalised ratio (INR).

However, mild thrombocytopenia (a platelet count of <150 × 109 cells per L) can be found in 70–95% of patients with severe COVID-19. Thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 has not been found to be an important predictor of disease progression or adverse outcome.5Thachil J Wada H Gando S et al.ISTH interim guidance on recognition and management of coagulopathy in COVID-19.J Thromb Haemost. 2020;  (published online March 25.)DOI:10.1111/jth.14810Google Scholar,  7Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Mean fibrinogen concentrations in patients with COVID-19 are at the upper limits of normal, presumably as an acute phase response. However, a sudden decrease in plasma fibrinogen to concentrations less than 1·0 g/L was observed shortly before death in a number of patients with COVID-19 in China.3Tang N Li D Wang X Sun Z Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia.J Thromb Haemost. 2020; 18: 844-847Google Scholar Plasma concentrations of antithrombin are lower in COVID-19 non-survivors than in survivors (84% of normal in non-survivors vs 91% in survivors); however, plasma concentrations rarely drop below 80% of normal.3Tang N Li D Wang X Sun Z Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia.J Thromb Haemost. 2020; 18: 844-847Google Scholar The combination of thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, and increased D-dimer is suggestive of DIC, although the pattern is distinctively different to DIC seen in sepsis.2Levi M Scully M How I treat disseminated intravascular coagulation.Blood. 2018; 131: 845-854Google Scholar In sepsis, thrombocytopenia is usually more profound, and D-dimer concentrations do not reach the high values seen in patients with COVID-19. In fact, most patients with COVID-19 would not be classified as having DIC according to the DIC score of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.2Levi M Scully M How I treat disseminated intravascular coagulation.Blood. 2018; 131: 845-854Google Scholar,  3Tang N Li D Wang X Sun Z Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia.J Thromb Haemost. 2020; 18: 844-847Google Scholar Other laboratory abnormalities in COVID-19 that might be relevant for the coagulopathy are increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and in some patients, strikingly high ferritin concentrations reminiscent of findings in thrombotic microangiopathy.8Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062Google Scholar Post-mortem findings in patients with COVID-19 show typical microvascular platelet-rich thrombotic depositions in small vessels of the lungs and other organs. However, there are no signs of haemolysis or schistocytes in the blood film and the platelet count is higher than would be expected in case of thrombotic microangiopathy (preprint reference; appendix). Taken together, available evidence suggests that the coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 is a combination of low-grade DIC and localised pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy, which could have a substantial impact on organ dysfunction in the most severely affected patients. Severe COVID-19 is also associated with increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukins (IL), including IL-1 and IL-6.7Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar IL-6 can induce tissue factor expression on mononuclear cells, which subsequently initiates coagulation activation and thrombin generation. TNF-α and IL-1 are the main mediators driving a suppression of endogenous anticoagulant pathways. In a subset of patients most severely affected by COVID-19, a cytokine storm profile can be found, characterised by high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.9Mehta P McAuley DF Brown M Sanchez E Tattersall RS Manson JJ COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1033-1034Google Scholar Coronavirus infections are also associated with a remarkable activation of the fibrinolytic system. Observations in urokinase-type plasminogen activator knock-out mice pointed to a urokinase-driven pathway stimulating fibrinolysis and being an important factor in lethality. In addition, plasma concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were 6-times higher in patients infected with human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) than in patients with no infection (appendix). Inflammation-induced endothelial cell injury could result in massive release of plasminogen activators, which could explain the high concentrations of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products in patients with severe COVID-19. Thrombotic microangiopathy is typically caused by pathologically enhanced platelet-vessel wall interaction due to ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers. These multimers are released from perturbed endothelial cells and are under normal circumstances cleaved by ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13). In many severe inflammatory states, upon systemic infection a secondary deficiency of ADAMTS13 has been established. Currently, there are no data on ADAMTS13 concentrations in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. The coagulation changes associated with COVID-19 suggest the presence of a hypercoagulable state that might increase the risk of thromboembolic complications. Immobilisation and vascular damage are other factors that can increase the risk of thrombosis. Patients with COVID-19 have anecdotally been reported to have had pulmonary embolism, suggesting that there could be a disproportionately high incidence of venous thromboembolism and possibly arterial thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. In critically ill patients, the incidence of thromboembolic complications ranges from 5% to 15% (appendix). Initial cohort studies show that the incidence of thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19 is 35–45% (appendix).10Klok FA Kruip M van der Meer NJM et al.Incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.Thromb Res. 2020;  (published online April 10.)DOI:10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013Google Scholar Some people have also suggested that pulmonary embolism could be involved in the rapid respiratory deterioration seen in some patients,10Klok FA Kruip M van der Meer NJM et al.Incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.Thromb Res. 2020;  (published online April 10.)DOI:10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013Google Scholar but for practical reasons, doing adequate objective diagnostic testing is not always possible (eg, CT-angiography). A retrospective study4Tang N Bai H Chen X Gong J Li D Sun Z Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy.J Thromb Haemost. 2020;  (published online March 27.)DOI:10.1111/jth.14817Google Scholar done in China that included 449 patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 infection showed a lower mortality in patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy who received prophylactic heparin than in patients not receiving anticoagulant treatment (40 [40%] of 99 patients vs 224 [64%] of 350 patients, p=0·029) in the subgroup of patients with a high sepsis-induced coagulopathy score. In particular, in patients with increased concentrations of D-dimer (6 times the upper limit of normal), mortality was lower in heparin-treated patients than those not treated with heparin. These results need to be interpreted with caution, as heparin treatment was not random and the conclusions were drawn from multiple post-hoc, subgroup analyses. A prospective randomised controlled trial testing the effectiveness of prophylactic heparin for the prevention of COVID-19-assocated coagulopathy is warranted to confirm these results. Using the available evidence, we suggest monitoring coagulopathy in patients with severe COVID-19 by measuring prothrombin time, platelet count, and D-dimer concentrations every 2–3 days (panel).5Thachil J Wada H Gando S et al.ISTH interim guidance on recognition and management of coagulopathy in COVID-19.J Thromb Haemost. 2020;  (published online March 25.)DOI:10.1111/jth.14810Google Scholar There is evidence supporting the use of prophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients. In view of the hypercoagulable state of patients with severe COVID-19, and the potential increased risk of thrombosis, we suggest that all patients with COVID-19 that are admitted to hospital should receive this prophylactic treatment in the absence of medical contraindications. If LMWH is not available, unfractionated heparin could be used, although this requires more frequent injections; an alternative is fondaparinux, but whether this drug has the postulated anti-inflammatory benefits of heparin is unclear. Patients with severe COVID-19 might need higher-dose thromboprophylaxis than is generally given because of their hypercoagulable state, and this hypothesis will be tested in several multicentre, randomised, controlled trials (NCT04372589, NCT04367831, NCT04345848, and NCT04366960).PanelManagement of coagulopathy in patients with severe COVID-19Diagnostic approach•Repeated (every 2–3 days) assessment of:•D-dimer•Prothrombin time•Platelet countsTherapeutic management•Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for all patients hospitalised•Consider venous thromboembolism in patients with rapid respiratory deterioration and high D-dimer concentrations•Do CT angiography or ultrasound of the venous system of the lower extremities•If diagnostic testing is not possible and there are no bleeding risk factors, consider therapeutic anticoagulation•Other interventions (such as plasma exchange, or administration of other anticoagulants or anti-inflammatory drugs) are experimental and should be considered in a clinical trial setting only Diagnostic approach •Repeated (every 2–3 days) assessment of:•D-dimer•Prothrombin time•Platelet counts Therapeutic management •Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for all patients hospitalised•Consider venous thromboembolism in patients with rapid respiratory deterioration and high D-dimer concentrations•Do CT angiography or ultrasound of the venous system of the lower extremities•If diagnostic testing is not possible and there are no bleeding risk factors, consider therapeutic anticoagulation•Other interventions (such as plasma exchange, or administration of other anticoagulants or anti-inflammatory drugs) are experimental and should be considered in a clinical trial setting only Preliminary observations suggest that in patients with high D-dimer concentrations and a sudden deterioration of respiratory insufficiency, pulmonary embolism should be part of the differential diagnosis. This diagnosis should be confirmed by imaging, although in some very unstable patients this might be difficult. Alternatively, venous ultrasound of the legs can be helpful to identify lower extremity thrombosis. In patients with a strong suspicion of pulmonary embolism in whom no objective diagnosis can be obtained, therapeutic anticoagulation could be started, particularly in the absence of risk factors for bleeding or other contraindications for anticoagulation. Of note, the incidence of haemorrhagic complications in patients with COVID-19, even those with severe coagulopathy, appear to be low.4Tang N Bai H Chen X Gong J Li D Sun Z Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy.J Thromb Haemost. 2020;  (published online March 27.)DOI:10.1111/jth.14817Google Scholar Other anticoagulant modalities have not yet been systematically studied in patients with COVID-19 and cannot be advocated at this point. Plasma exchange could be helpful as a treatment of thrombotic microangiopathy by delivering high volumes of plasma, replenishing missing factors (eg, ADAMTS-13 or complement proteins) and removing excess inflammatory mediators; however, this treatment needs to be further evaluated in a controlled trial setting.

Given the absence of a vaccine or treatment, prevention is the primary guard against adverse events, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. However, prevention requires keeping infected and uninfected patients apart as much as possible. Because some patients with COVID-19 can be contagious yet asymptomatic, especially in the initial days after infection, knowing who is infected requires timely diagnostic testing as well as when and how a patient was exposed and when symptoms began. This could be challenging in individuals with psychiatric or substance use disorders as some are unable to recall or are unaware of potential exposures and symptom onset. Even under optimal conditions, current diagnostic tests do not effectively identify infected individuals and, as more people become infected, the number of false negatives increases. Furthermore, new polymerase chain reaction and serological tests arise each week, often with limited performance information, which adds to the confusion about COVID-19 tests.1Congress of the United States House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform Subcommittee StaffPreliminary findings of the subcommittee's coronavirus antibody testing investigation.https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/ECP%20Staff%20Report%20on%20Preliminary%20Findings%20of%20the%20Subcommittee's%20Coronavirus%20Antibody%20Testing%20Investigation.pdfDate: 2020Date accessed: April 29, 2020Google Scholar People with psychiatric conditions or substance use disorders, particularly those in residential treatment or inpatient facilities, are at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19, not only because of the difficulty in evaluating their medical symptoms and history, but also because of frequent patient turnover, limited space and staff, and general resource constraints in many facilities. Patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—the virus responsible for the development of COVID-19—pose a substantial threat of spreading the virus because they come in contact with other susceptible individuals given the close quarters and communal living environments. Furthermore, these patients are at higher risk for complications of COVID-19 because they frequently have underlying medical conditions that worsen their prognosis (eg, cardiac disease, history of smoking). The vulnerability of institutionalised populations has been noted by clinicians and researchers, and we extend this work by drawing attention to this particularly high-risk subgroup and the problems posed by the performance of current diagnostic technology.2Barnett ML Grabowski DC Nursing homes are ground zero for COVID-19 pandemic.https://jamanetwork.com/channels/health-forum/fullarticle/2763666Date: 2020Date accessed: April 8, 2020Google Scholar,  3Gessen M Why psychiatric wards are uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus.https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-psychiatric-wards-are-uniquely-vulnerable-to-the-coronavirusDate: 2020Date accessed: April 22, 2020Google Scholar One solution would be to test all individuals for COVID-19 before entry into treatment facilities. Testing capacity has improved; however, access remains limited and test sensitivity is modest, which results in false negatives.4Marcotte LM Liao JM Incorporating test characteristics into SARS-CoV-2 testing policy—sense and sensitivity.https://jamanetwork.com/channels/health-forum/fullarticle/2764750Date: 2020Date accessed: April 14, 2020Google Scholar,  5Stein R Study raises questions about false negatives from quick COVID-19 test.https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/21/838794281/study-raises-questions-about-false-negatives-from-quick-covid-19-testDate: 2020Date accessed: April 21, 2020Google Scholar Test performance is further compromised by variations in test quality, sample collection, and duration of symptom onset, increasing the potential for error.6Koerth M There are not enough COVID-19 tests.

Thus, the pretest probability of infection with SARS-CoV-2 could be hard to estimate. Fundamentally, when the sensitivity of a test is limited and the disease course for a patient is unknown, the test outcome could be unreliable and infectious patients could be placed erroneously in treatment facilities. Already, there has been evidence of rapid spread of COVID-19 through long-term care facilities and inpatient psychiatry units,7Ramgopal K Coronavirus in a psychiatric hospital: ‘it's the worst of all worlds’.https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/coronavirus-psychiatric-hospital-it-s-worst-all-worlds-n1184266Date: 2020Date accessed: April 18, 2020Google Scholar,  8Yao H Chen JH Xu YF Patients with mental health disorders in the COVID-19 epidemic.Lancet Psychiatry. 2020; 7: e21Google Scholar with several reporting patient deaths attributed to COVID-19. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing and frequent handwashing can be difficult to implement in these types of inpatient or residential settings, as some individuals might not be able to adhere to recommendations. Best practice should involve screening all patients for symptoms of COVID-19, particularly before admission, and a protocol should be implemented for management of inpatients who develop symptoms.9Li L Challenges and priorities in responding to COVID-19 in inpatient psychiatry.Psychiatric Serv. 2020;  (published online April 23)DOI:10.1176/appi.ps.202000166Google Scholar One potential strategy for improving detection could involve testing all patients for COVID-19 at two or more time points before entry to the inpatient unit to mitigate the risk of false negative results for those with uncertain time of disease onset. Another would be to require sample testing from multiple body sites with more than one sample, analogous to blood culture protocols, which could address concerns about sampling technique. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 should remain separated from other people until testing indicates they are no longer infectious. As serological tests and additional diagnostic or risk information become available, diagnostic certainty and detection should improve, at which point existing protocols should be adapted. Because of the potential for rapid spread and serious complications, implementation of such preventative efforts must occur immediately. This should be done in combination with the development of a rigorous evidence base monitoring diagnostic testing and disease transmission in this rapidly changing environment by use of creative study designs. In addition to testing patients, prevention should centre around providing safe conditions for patients and staff. The United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently released guidelines allowing for patient separation on the basis of COVID-19 status for patients in long-term care facilities.10Center for Clinical Standards and Quality/QualitySafety & Oversight Group2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) long-term care facility transfer scenarios.https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-20-25-nh.pdfDate: 2020Date accessed: April 27, 2020Google Scholar Analogous considerations for individuals with mental illness in residential or acute care facilities would probably benefit this population. These recommendations are burdensome, but necessary given increasing reports of rapid spread within facilities housing susceptible individuals. The structure of these facilities and patient populations make monitoring illness course and preventing the spread of COVID-19 more difficult, but these risks can be mitigated by employing testing strategies that attempt to lift the shroud of false negative test results.

Many repurposed drugs have been shown to have in-vitro activity against the close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, which are all beta-coronaviruses. Lopinavir and many interferons, particularly interferon beta, have been shown to have modest activity in vitro against SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and can be used synergistically with ribavirin.5Chen F Chan KH Jiang Y et al.In vitro susceptibility of 10 clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus to selected antiviral compounds.J Clin Virol. 2004; 31: 69-75Google Scholar,  6Chan JF Chan KH Kao RY et al.Broad-spectrum antivirals for the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect. 2013; 67: 606-616Google Scholar In 2003, we did an open-label trial using historical controls, and showed that a combination of lopinavir–ritonavir with ribavirin reduced the mortality and need for intensive respiratory support of patients with SARS who had been admitted to hospital.7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar Moreover, lopinavir–ritonavir or interferon beta-1b has been shown to reduce viral load and improve lung pathology in a common marmoset model.8Chan JF Yao Y Yeung ML et al.Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir or interferon-β1b improves outcome of MERS-CoV infection in a nonhuman primate model of common marmoset.J Infect Dis. 2015; 212: 1904-1913Google Scholar However the viral load of SARS and MERS peaks at around day 7–10 after symptom onset, whereas the viral load of COVID-19 peaks at the time of presentation, similar to influenza.9To KK-W Tsang OT-Y Leung W-S et al.Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online March 23.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30196-1Google Scholar,  10Cheng VC Tang BS Wu AK Chu CM Yuen KY Medical treatment of viral pneumonia including SARS in immunocompetent adult.J Infect. 2004; 49: 262-273Google Scholar Experience from the treatment of patients with influenza who are admitted to hospital suggested that a combination of multiple antiviral drugs is more effective than single drug treatments in this setting of patients with a high viral load at presentation.11Dunning J Baillie JK Cao B Hayden FG Antiviral combinations for severe influenza.Lancet Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 1259-1270Google Scholar,  12Hung IFN To KKW Chan JFW et al.Efficacy of clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination in the treatment of patients hospitalized for influenza A(H3N2) infection: an open-label randomized, controlled, phase IIb/III trial.Chest. 2017; 151: 1069-1080Google Scholar Therefore, we did this phase 2 randomised trial to establish whether a combination of three modestly active drugs against SARS-CoV-2 can improve the viral load profile and clinical parameters in adults with COVID-19 requiring hospital admission. Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on March 30, 2020, using the terms “Covid-19”, “interferon beta 1b”, “lopinavir/ ritonavir”, “treatment”, “hospitalized”, “patients”, “phase 2”, and “trial” for articles in English published up to the date of the search. Our search did not show any randomised controlled trials assessing a combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Added value of this studyThis is the first randomised controlled trial on the triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin, compared with single-drug lopinavir–ritonavir in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Treatment with the triple combination effectively suppressed viral load in all clinical specimens, including the nasopharyngeal swab, throat saliva, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and stool in most patients 8 days from treatment commencement, which was significantly shorter than the time taken in the control group, treated with lopinavir–ritonavir alone. The triple combination also alleviated symptoms completely within 4 days—a significantly shorter time than the control. The triple combination also suppressed IL-6 levels. The clinical and virological efficacy resulted in shorter hospital stays and facilitated infection control. This treatment regimen was also shown to be safe, with minor and self-limiting gastrointestinal adverse events of diarrhoea and vomiting. Increased liver enzymes were uncommon, and resolved upon stopping the medications.Implications of all the available evidenceThis study showed that early treatment with the triple combination of antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin is safe and highly effective in shortening the duration of virus shedding, decreasing cytokine responses, alleviating symptoms, and facilitating the discharge of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Furthermore, the triple antiviral therapy rapidly rendered viral load negative in all specimens, thereby reducing infectiousness of the patient.

Furthermore, the triple antiviral therapy rapidly rendered viral load negative in all specimens, thereby reducing infectiousness of the patient. This was a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial. Adult patients aged at least 18 years admitted to hospital from Feb 10, 2020, for virologically confirmed COVID-19, were recruited from the Queen Mary Hospital, Pamela Youde Nethersole Hospital, Ruttonjee Hospital, United Christian Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and Tuen Mun Hospital in Hong Kong. These six major public hospitals are positioned across five of the seven hospital clusters, and serve 75% of the 7·5 million population. Public health ordinance in Hong Kong required all patients tested positive for COVID-19 be admitted to hospital. Eligibility criteria for the study were age at least 18 years, a national early warning score 2 (NEWS2) of at least 1, and symptom duration of 14 days or less upon recruitment (appendix pp 9–10). The institutional review board of the University of Hong Kong Hospital Authority approved this study (UW20–074). All patients gave written consent for participation in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to either the triple combination lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta-1b group or the control group (lopinavir–ritonavir only), in the ratio of 2:1, by simple randomisation with no stratification. Randomised treatment was open-label. Patients were assigned to a serial number by the study coordinator. Each serial number was linked to a computer-generated randomisation list assigning the antiviral treatment regimens. The study medications were dispensed by the hospital pharmacy and then to the patients by the medical ward nurses. In the combination group, patients who were recruited and treated less than 7 days from symptom onset received a triple combination of 14 days of oral lopinavir–ritonavir (lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg) every 12 h (via nasogastric tube to intubated patients), ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and subcutaneous injection of one to three doses of interferon beta-1b 1 mL (8 million international units [IU]) on alternate days depending on the day of drug commencement (if commenced on day 1–2 from symptom onset, the patient received all three doses of interferon beta-1b; if commenced on day 3–4, the patient received two doses; if commenced on day 5–6, the patient received one dose). For those recruited and treated between days 7 and 14, interferon beta-1b injection was omitted to avoid its proinflammatory effects. Patients assigned to the control group received only oral lopinavir–ritonavir (lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg) every 12 h for 14 days. For patients who had no history of prolonged QTc syndrome, but were found to have prolonged QTc less than 480 ms, first-degree heart block or bundle branch block, or bradycardia upon ECG examination, and those who developed increased alanine transaminase of three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), the lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was reduced to once per day. Lopinavir–ritonavir would be stopped if alanine transaminase levels exceeded six times the ULN. The randomisation window from symptom onset was extended from 10 to 14 days after trial commencement after knowing that the incubation period could go beyond 14 days. Because a placebo group was generally not accepted in Chinese culture, and our previous study showed that interferon beta-1b and lopinavir–ritonavir are active against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, lopinavir–ritonavir was used in the control group whereas interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin were used in the combination group for patients admitted less than 7 days from symptom onset. The intervention treatment had to be started within 48 h after hospital admission. Standard of care included oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, dialysis support, and antimicrobial treatment for secondary bacterial infection as indicated clinically. Stress doses of corticosteroid (50 mg hydrocortisone every 8 h intravenously, tapering over 7 days) were given to patients who developed oxygen desaturation and required oxygen support. Non-invasive or invasive ventilatory support beyond day 7 from symptom onset was at the discretion of the consultants. Clinical findings including history and physical examination, and laboratory and radiological investigation results were entered into a predesigned database. Chest radiograph and ECG were taken at baseline and at regular intervals for monitoring of patient progress and to detect early cardiac rhythm changes. Patients with underlying cardiac conditions were put on cardiac monitoring. High-resolution CT was done at the consultants' discretion. All patients were followed up at the infectious disease clinic within 30 days after discharge. Initial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made upon admission. All recruited patients had to have laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR in the nasopharyngeal swab. Daily nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, stool or rectal swabs, and urine if available, were obtained until discharge, for quantification of viral load and genetic mutation testing (appendix pp 20–23). Complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and cytokine profile were regularly checked until discharge (appendix p 21). Blood and urine samples for bacterial culture were taken when clinically indicated. The nasopharyngeal swab upon admission was assessed by BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 plus (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Methods for assays by quantitative RT-PCR, serum cytokine profiling, and nanopore sequencing for nsp5 mutation are in the appendix (pp 20–23). The primary endpoint was time to achieve a negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Secondary clinical endpoints were time to resolution of symptoms defined as a NEWS2 of 0 maintained for 24 h; daily NEWS2 and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; length of hospital stay; and 30-day mortality. Other virological endpoints included the time to achieve negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in all clinical samples, including nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, stool, and urine; daily viral load changes in the first 7 days; and emergence of amino acid mutations in the nsp5 gene encoding a 3C-like protease. The serum cytokine response was also measured. Safety endpoints were the frequencies and duration of adverse events. It is important to note that COVID-19 is a new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is phylogenetically closest to the 2003 SARS-CoV. At the time of study design in mid-January, 2020, there was insufficient information on the mortality of COVID-19. Thus, we based our sample size calculation on our own findings of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment in a trial on the 2003 SARS-CoV.7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar The current study was designed on the basis of an estimated difference of 26·4% in the 21-day mortality or acute respiratory distress syndrome rate in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, when treated with lopinavir–ritonavir (2·4%) versus historical controls without antiviral treatment (28·8%). The necessary sample size had been calculated to be 30 patients per group to detect such a difference at a two-sided α level of 0·05, with 80% power. The protocol proposed recruiting at least 35 patients per group to allow for a 17% dropout rate. The primary endpoint was assessed in the intention-to-treat population of all randomised patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned drug. Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test and continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, for both intention-to-treat and subgroup analyses. For viral load, specimens with undetectable viral load were assigned a value of 1 log10 copies per mL for the purpose of statistical analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model. Factors significant at univariable analysis (p<0·10) were further assessed by means of a multivariable analysis by Cox proportional hazards model to identify the independent factors for negative nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR on day 7 after treatment. A p value of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version 26.0 and PRISM, version 8. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04276688. The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Between Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 144 patients were screened, and 127 patients were recruited (figure 1). The number of patients screened accounted for 80% of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong during this period. Nine patients did not fulfil the inclusion criteria (four with second-degree and third-degree cardiac arrhythmia, two with severe depression, and three because of pregnancy) and eight patients declined the treatment regimen. One patient in the control group required discontinuation of lopinavir–ritonavir because of alanine transaminase six times greater than the ULN after 1 week of treatment. The median age was 52 years (IQR 32–62); 68 (54%) patients were men versus 59 (46%) women (table 1). 51 (40%) patients had underlying diseases. The median time to hospital admission from symptom onset was 5 days (IQR 3–7).Figure 1Trial profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT)Table 1Baseline demographics of the study populationCombination group (n=86)Control group (n=41)Age51·0 (31·0–61·3)52·0 (33·5–62·5)SexMen45 (52%)23 (56%)Women41 (48%)18 (44%)Time from symptoms onset to start of treatment, days5 (4–7)4 (3–8)Underlying diseasesDiabetes11 (13%)6 (15%)Hypertension23 (27%)13 (32%)Coronary artery disease5 (6%)5 (12%)Cerebrovascular disease1 (1%)1 (2%)Hyperlipidaemia18 (21%)11 (27%)Thyroid disease3 (3%)1 (2%)Obstructive sleep apnoea1 (1%)1 (2%)Crohn's disease1 (1%)0Epilepsy1 (1%)0Tuberculosis2 (2%)0Chronic hepatitis B2 (2%)1 (2%)Chronic hepatitis C01 (2%)Malignancy1 (1%)1 (2%)Smoker6 (7%)1 (2%)Symptoms and signsFever70 (81%)32 (78%)Chills13 (15%)6 (15%)Cough45 (52%)23 (56%)Sputum29 (34%)13 (32%)Shortness of breath7 (8%)7 (17%)Sore throat16 (19%)10 (24%)Myalgia10 (12%)8 (20%)Malaise19 (22%)5 (12%)Nausea or vomiting1 (1%)0Diarrhoea17 (20%)7 (17%)Rhinorrhoea14 (16%)10 (24%)Anosmia4 (5%)1 (2%)Headache3 (3%)3 (7%)Chest tightness2 (2%)0Anorexia1 (1%)0Baseline laboratory findings (normal range)Haemoglobin (11·5–14·8 g/dL)13·4 (12·7–14·9)13·5 (12·7–14·8)White cell count (3·89–9·93 × 109 per L)4·9 (3·7–6·2)5·4 (4·6–6·4)Neutrophils (2·01–7·42 × 109 per L)3·4 (2·4–4·3)3·5 (2·9–4·5)Lymphocytes (1·06–3·61 × 109 per L)1·0 (0·8–1·5)1·3 (0·9–1·6)Platelets (154–371 × 109 per L)195·0 (171·8–260·0)192·0 (160·5–244·5)Alanine aminotransferase (8–45 U/L)23·0 (15·0–33·3)26·0 (14·5–43·0)Alkaline phosphatase (42–110 U/L)58·0 (48·0–75·0)65·0 (52·5–75·0)Lactate dehydrogenase (143–280 U/L)194·0 (159·8–249·0)167·5 (142·0–200·0)Bilirubin (4–23 μmol/L)7·9 (5·5–9·0)7·5 (6·0–10·8)Creatinine (49–82 μmol/L)75·5 (65·0–92·0)76·0 (62·5–96·0)Urea (2·9–8·0 mmol/L)4·0 (2·9–4·8)3·7 (2·7–4·6)Creatine kinase (22–198 U/L)79·0 (50·0–151·0)90·5 (54·5–141·5)C-reactive protein (<0·76 mg/dL)3·0 (2·0–9·2)3·0 (1·5–7·2)Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (<12 mm/h)19·0 (11·0–48·0)19·0 (9·8–37·8)Baseline radiological findings (%)Abnormal chest x-ray64 (74%)32 (78%)Right upper zone infiltrate00 (0%)Right middle zone infiltrate4 (5%)6 (15%)Right lower zone infiltrate38 (44%)18 (44%)Left upper zone infiltrate1 (1%)0Left middle zone infiltrate7 (8%)7 (17%)Left lower zone infiltrate27 (31%)10 (24%)High-resolution CT (performed in 22 patients)14 (16%)6 (15%)Data are n (%) or median (IQR).

U/L=units per L. Among the 127 patients, 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 patients were assigned to the control group. Within the combination group, 52 patients were admitted to hospital less than 7 days from symptom onset and received the lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta-1b regimen, and 34 patients who were admitted 7 days or more after symptom onset received the lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin only regimen. The median number of doses of interferon beta-1b received was two. Median time from symptom onset to start of treatment was 5 days (4–7) for the combination group and 4 days (3–8) for the control group (table 1). The age, sex, and baseline demographics in each group were similar. Fever and unproductive cough were the most common presenting signs and symptoms. Both diarrhoea and anosmia were infrequent. Most patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate upon presentation. One patient in the combination group had concomitant rhinovirus infection upon presentation.

For the primary endpoint of time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab, the combination group had a significantly shorter median time (7 days [IQR 5–11]) than the control group (12 days [8–15]; HR 4·37 [95% CI 1·86–10·24], p=0·0010; table 2). Clinical improvement was significantly better in the combination group, with a significantly shorter time to complete alleviation of symptoms, defined as a NEWS2 of 0 (4 days [IQR 3–8] in the combination group vs 8 days [7–9] in the control group; HR 3·92 [95% CI 1·66–9·23], p<0·0001) and SOFA score of 0 (3·0 days [1·0–8·0] vs 8·0 days [6·5–9·0]; HR 1·89 [1·03–3·49], p=0·041; table 2). A similar pattern was observed on the daily NEWS2 (all p<0·0001; figure 2A) and daily SOFA score after treatment (all p<0·05 except day 1 [p=0·21]; table 2). The significantly better clinical and virological response is also reflected in the shorter median hospital stay in the combination group than in the control group (9·0 days [7·0–13·0] vs 14·5 days [9·3–16·0]; HR 2·72 [1·2–6·13], p=0·016).Figure 2Outcomes over timeShow full caption(A) National early warning score 2; (B) nasopharyngeal swab viral load; (C) posterior oropharyngeal saliva viral load; (D) throat swab viral load; (E) stool viral load; and (F) serum IL-6 cytokine concentration (first 60 recruited patients).

Data points are medians and error bars are IQRs. For the virological outcome, the combination treatment was associated with significantly shorter time to negative viral load in all specimens when assessed individually (nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool samples) as well as in all specimens combined (table 2). All urine samples tested negative for viral load. All patients had a SARS-CoV-2 positive baseline nasopharyngeal swab. With regards to the other clinical samples, 108 (85%) patients provided posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples, 99 (78%) provided throat swabs, 36 (28%) provided stool samples, and 83 (65%) provided urine samples. The baseline viral loads for all specimens were similar between the combination group and control group (table 2). The nasopharyngeal swab viral load was significantly lower in the combination group than in the control group from day 1 to day 7 after treatment (figure 2B). Similar results were found in the posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool specimens after treatment (figure 2C–E). Post-hoc subgroup comparison of the 76 patients who started treatment less than 7 days after onset of symptoms showed better clinical and virological outcomes in the combination group (52 patients, receiving lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta-1b) than in the control group (24 patients; table 3) across all measured variables except stool samples. However, no significant differences between the treatment groups were measured in these outcomes in the 51 patients who were treated 7 days or more after symptom onset (34 in the combination group [receiving lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin only] and 17 in the control group; appendix p 31).Table 3Subgroup analysis of clinical, viral load, and cytokine profileStarted treatment <7 days from symptom onsetStarted treatment ≥7 days from symptom onsetCombination group (with interferon beta-1b; n=52)Control group (n=24)p valueCombination group (without interferon beta-1b; n=34)Control group (n=17)p valueNEWS2Baseline2 (1–2)2 (2–2)0·112 (1–2)2 (1–2)0·49Day 11 (1–1)2 (2–2)<0·00012 (1–2)2 (1–2)0·71Day 21·0 (0·0–1·0)2·0 (1·5–3·0)<0·00011·5 (1·0–2·0)2·0 (1·0–2·8)0·41Day 30·0 (0·0–1·0)2·0 (1·0–3·0)<0·00011·0 (1·0–2·0)2·0 (0·3–2·8)0·16Day 40·0 (0·0–0·0)2·0 (1·0–2·5)<0·00011·0 (1·0–2·0)2·0 (0·3–2·0)0·37Day 50 (0–0·5)2 (1–2)<0·00011 (0–1)2 (0–2)0·040Day 60 (0–0·3)1 (1–2)<0·00011 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·14Day 70 (0–0)1 (0–2)<0·00011 (0–1)1 (0–1)0·68Time to NEWS2 of 0, days4·0 (3·0–5·0)8·0 (6·5–9·0)<0·00016·0 (5·0–10·8)8·0 (5·5–8·0)0·90SOFA scoreBaseline0 (0–1)0 (0–1)0·991 (0–1)0 (0–1)0·17Day 10·0 (0·0–1·0)1·0 (0·0–1·0)0·0301·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–1·5)0·67Day 20 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·00601 (0–2)1 (0–2)0·72Day 30 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·00501 (0–2)1 (0–3)0·49Day 40 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·00601 (0–2)1 (0–3)0·48Day 50·0 (0·0–0·8)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·00301·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–3·0)0·55Day 60·0 (0·0–0·0)0·5 (0·0–2·0)0·00101·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·88Day 70·0 (0·0–0·0)0·5 (0·0–2·0)<0·00011·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·88Time to SOFA score of 0, days3 (1–5)7 (1–9)0·00108 (1–8)8 (1–9)0·23Duration of hospital stay, days8 (6–12·5)15 (9–16)0·003013 (8–15)13·5 (12·3–21·8)0·09030-day mortality0 (0)0 (0)1·000 (0)0 (0)1·00Time to negative viral load, daysNasopharyngeal swab6·5 (4·0–8·0)12·5 (8·0–14·8)<0·000110·5 (8·0–12·3)12·0 (8·0–17·0)0·10Posterior oropharyngeal saliva6·0 (2·0–7·0)8·5 (5·3–11·8)<0·00018·0 (6·0–9·0)8·0 (5·3–9·0)0·79Throat swab4·0 (1·0–6·0)8·0 (3·3–12·8)0·00105·0 (1·5–8·0)4·5 (2·0–9·0)0·52Stool4·5 (2·0–5·0)6·0 (3·0–7·0)0·0705·0 (2·0–10·0)7·0 (5·5–8·5)0·14All specimens7·0 (4·0–9·0)13·0 (8·0–14·0)<0·000112·0 (7·8–14·0)12·0 (12·0–19·0)0·080Virological findings (RT-PCR), log10 copies per mLNasopharyngeal swab (baseline)7 (5·2–8·4)6·1 (4·3–7·7)0·295·5 (3·8–7·3)6·6 (3·8–8)0·65Posterior oropharyngeal saliva (baseline)5·4 (3·9–7·3)5·3 (3·9–7·5)0·864·8 (3·8–6·2)5·4 (4·9–6·8)0·30Throat swab (baseline)4·8 (3·2–6·9)4·4 (3·5–6·1)0·814·5 (1·0–5·6)5·0 (4·0–5·5)0·52Stool (baseline)3·2 (1·9–6·2)3·2 (2·9–5·6)0·853·3 (2·8–3·9)5·6 (1·9–7·4)0·48Cytokine concentration, log10 pg/mLIL-6 (baseline)1·4 (1–1·5)1·4 (1·4–1·6)0·131·4 (1–1·4)1 (1–1·6)0·45TNFα (baseline)1 (1–1)1 (1–1)0·871 (1–1)1 (1–1)0·82Data are median (IQR).

NEWS2=national early warning score 2. SOFA=sequential organ failure assessment. 17 (13%) of 127 patients developed oxygen desaturation and required oxygen treatment (table 2). Six (5%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, of whom five required non-invasive ventilator support and one 96-year-old female patient with a past medical history of coronary artery disease required intubation and ventilator support. She was in the control group and was successfully extubated after 10 days of intensive care. 69 (54%) patients received concomitant antibiotics. Eight (6%) patients were given stress doses of corticosteroids in the second week from symptom onset. The serum cytokine profile was analysed in the first 84 recruited patients. The IL-6 concentration in the combination group was significantly lower than in the control group on days 2, 6, and 8 (figure 2F). TNFα concentrations and IL-10 concentrations were not significantly different between the groups. No significant nsp5 mutations were identified in serial nasopharyngeal swab samples. Multivariable analysis showed that the combination group and having a normal baseline chest x-ray were independently associated with day 7 negative nasopharyngeal swab viral load. Of the two, the combination group was the most significant independent factor (HR 4·27 [95% CI 1·82–10·02], p=0·0010; appendix p 30). Adverse events were reported by 41 (48%) of 86 patients in the combination group and 20 (49%) of 41 patients in the control group. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea (52 [41%] of 127 patients), fever (48 [38%] patients), nausea (43 [34%]) and raised alanine transaminase level (18 [14%]; table 4). These side-effects mostly resolved within 3 days after drug initiation. Sinus bradycardia was reported by four (3%) patients. There were no differences between incidence of any of the adverse events or durations of nausea or diarrhoea between the treatment groups. The peak median alanine transaminase concentration was 38·0 units per L (24·5–62·5) and peak median bilirubin was 22·0 μmol/L (17·0–32·5), in all patients. No serious adverse events were reported in the combination group. One patient in the control group had a serious adverse event of impaired hepatic enzymes requiring discontinuation of treatment. No patients died during the study.Table 4Adverse events in the study populationCombination group (n=86)Control group (n=41)p valueAdverse eventsNausea30 (35%)13 (32%)0·87Diarrhoea34 (40%)18 (44%)0·54Increased alanine aminotransferase11 (13%)7 (17%)0·32Hyperbilirubinaemia4 (5%)3 (7%)0·54Sinus bradycardia3 (4%)1 (2%)0·77Fever32 (37%)16 (39%)0·73Serious adverse events01 (2%)0·15Duration of nausea, days2 (1–2)2 (1–2)0·80Duration of diarrhoea, days3 (3–3)3 (3–3)0·88                            Open table in a new tab                         In this multicentre randomised open-label phase 2 trial in patients with COVID-19, we showed that a triple combination of an injectable interferon (interferon beta-1b), oral protease inhibitor (lopinavir–ritonavir), and an oral nucleoside analogue (ribavirin), when given within 7 days of symptom onset, is effective in suppressing the shedding of SARS-CoV-2, not just in a nasopharyngeal swab, but in all clinical specimens, compared with lopinavir–ritonavir alone. Furthermore, the significant reductions in duration of RT-PCR positivity and viral load were associated with clinical improvement as shown by the significant reduction in NEWS2 and duration of hospital stay. Most patients treated with the triple combination were RT-PCR negative in all specimens by day 8. The side-effects were generally mild and self-limiting. Specific highly active antiviral drugs are always needed for any novel emerging infectious disease because the development of a new antiviral takes years before its approval for clinical use. Therefore, drug repurposing by testing existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that have been used to treat other viral infections is the most feasible approach in a pandemic. Many drugs have been shown to have some in-vitro activity against betacoronaviruses, including remdesivir, favipiravir, nitazoxanide, camostat mesilate, interferons, lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and convalescent plasma containing neutralising antibodies.5Chen F Chan KH Jiang Y et al.In vitro susceptibility of 10 clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus to selected antiviral compounds.J Clin Virol. 2004; 31: 69-75Google Scholar,  6Chan JF Chan KH Kao RY et al.Broad-spectrum antivirals for the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect. 2013; 67: 606-616Google Scholar,  7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar,  8Chan JF Yao Y Yeung ML et al.Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir or interferon-β1b improves outcome of MERS-CoV infection in a nonhuman primate model of common marmoset.J Infect Dis. 2015; 212: 1904-1913Google Scholar,  13Agostini ML Andres EL Sims AC et al.Coronavirus susceptibility to the antiviral remdesivir (GS-5734) is mediated by the viral polymerase and the proofreading exoribonulcease.MBio. 2018; 9: e00221-e00318Google Scholar,  14Li G De Clercq E Therapeutic options for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020; 19: 149-150Google Scholar,  15Wang M Cao R Zhang L et al.Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 269-271Google Scholar,  16Rossignol JF Nitazoxanide, a new drug candidate for the treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect Public Health. 2016; 9: 227-230Google Scholar,  17Beigel JH Nam HH Adams PL et al.Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics - a meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference.Antiviral Res. 2019; 167: 45-67Google Scholar,  18Sheahan TP Sims AC Leist SR et al.Comparative therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir and combination lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 222Google Scholar,  19Mair-Jenkins J Saavedra-Campos M Baillie JK et al.The effectiveness of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis.J Infect Dis. 2015; 211: 80-90Google Scholar,  20Cunningham AC Goh HP Koh D Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges.Crit Care. 2020; 24: 91Google Scholar,  21Dong L Hu S Gao J Discovering drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Drug Discov Ther. 2020; 14: 58-60Google Scholar These drugs have known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, side-effects, and dosing regimens. As expected, lopinavir–ritonavir alone was shown to have similar effects to placebo on reducing viral load when treatment was initiated at a median of 13 days after symptom onset, despite some improvement in symptoms.22Cao B Wang Y Wen D et al.A trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online March 18.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2001282Google Scholar Up to now, only two open-label non-randomised trials have been reported. One trial used a combination of oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 20 patients with COVID-19 showing that this combination might reduce viral load significantly by day 6 after treatment, compared with 16 controls from another hospital, which could be due to chance because this combination was not planned a priori and the addition of azithromycin was at the physician's discretion.23Gautret P Lagier JC Parola P et al.Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 20.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949Google Scholar A small retrospective analysis showed that viral load was negative at day 7 post-treatment in 75% of patients with COVID-19 treated with arbidol and lopinavir–ritonavir (16 patients) versus 35% of patients treated with lopinavir–ritonavir alone (17 patients).24Deng L Li C Zeng Q et al.Arbidol combined with LPV/r versus LPV/r alone against Corona Virus Disease 2019: a retrospective cohort study.J Infect. 2020;  (published March 11.)DOI:10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002Google Scholar Under the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region public health ordinance, all patients with COVID-19 must stay in hospital until nasopharyngeal swab viral loads are negative on 2 consecutive days. Thus, most patients were admitted to hospital within 7 days of symptom onset, allowing recruitment into the clinical trial during the early course of COVID-19. With the memory of the 2003 SARS pandemic, most patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong accepted antiviral treatment, which explained our high recruitment rate. Despite being an open-label study, all patients were enrolled consecutively without bias. Our case demographics and proportion of patients with underlying diseases were similar to other reported cohorts in China. The low crude mortality rate in Hong Kong (four [0·4%] of 1041 cases) could be explained by the highly vigilant infection control measures, efficient contact tracing, and early hospital admission and treatment. Early treatment with a triple combination of modestly active antivirals is appropriate for the treatment of COVID-19 because the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks at around the time of symptom onset. This is unlike the situation of SARS and MERS when the antiviral treatment has time to suppress the viral load before it peaks at around days 7–10 after symptom onset. The viral load profile of COVID-19 is similar to that of influenza, which has a high viral load at the time of initiation of anti-influenza treatment. The emergence of resistant influenza virus quasispecies during treatment has been well reported with single-drug treatment by amantadine, baloxavir marboxil, and oseltamivir in the setting of severe influenza or diseases caused by H5N1, H7N9, or in immunosuppressed hosts.11Dunning J Baillie JK Cao B Hayden FG Antiviral combinations for severe influenza.Lancet Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 1259-1270Google Scholar,  17Beigel JH Nam HH Adams PL et al.Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics - a meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference.Antiviral Res. 2019; 167: 45-67Google Scholar,  25Hayden FG Sugaya N Hirotsu N et al.Baloxavir marboxil for uncomplicated influenza in adults and adolescents.N Engl J Med. 2018; 379: 913-923Google Scholar Thus, the antiviral combination was considered a reasonable option to improve the outcome of severe influenza. Indeed, we have previously shown that a combination of naproxen and clarithromycin, with weak anti-influenza virus activity in vitro individually, when combined with oseltamivir can improve the morbidity and mortality and shorten the duration of hospital stay in patients with influenza A/H3N2 pneumonia.12Hung IFN To KKW Chan JFW et al.Efficacy of clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination in the treatment of patients hospitalized for influenza A(H3N2) infection: an open-label randomized, controlled, phase IIb/III trial.Chest. 2017; 151: 1069-1080Google Scholar Furthermore, we have previously shown that a combination of lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin significantly reduced mortality and respiratory failure in patients during the 2003 SARS outbreak.7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar Thus, we hypothesised that a triple combination of modest antiviral drugs might rapidly suppress the high initial viral load, improve the clinical parameters, and reduce risk of health-care workers by reducing the duration and quantity of virus shedding from these treated patients. An in-vitro study in cell culture-based assays showed that the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of lopinavir against SARS-CoV is about 17 μM and against MERS-CoV it is about 8 μM, whereas the peak serum lopinavir concentration is about 15 μM with a half-life of 7·4–10·8 h after an oral dose of 400 mg lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir.26de Wilde AH Jochmans D Posthuma CC et al.Screening of an FDA-approved compound library identifies four small-molecule inhibitors of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication in cell culture.Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 4875-4884Google Scholar The EC50 of interferon beta-1b is 0·12 IU/mL against SARS-CoV and 17·6 IU/mL against MERS-CoV,6Chan JF Chan KH Kao RY et al.Broad-spectrum antivirals for the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect. 2013; 67: 606-616Google Scholar,  27Tan EL Ooi EE Lin CY et al.Inhibition of SARS coronavirus infection in vitro with clinically approved antiviral drugs.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 581-586Google Scholar whereas its peak serum level is about 20 IU/mL with a half-life of 2–5 h after a single subcutaneous dose of 8 million IU. Notably, the maintenance of high serum interferon beta-1b level is not essential once the antiviral status of exposed cells is induced. The EC50 of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 was 109 μM,15Wang M Cao R Zhang L et al.Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 269-271Google Scholar which greatly exceeds the drug's serum concentration with the usual oral dosing. Nevertheless, synergistic activity between interferons and a lower dose of ribavirin have been shown in checkerboard assays. However, combining ribavirin with interferons (alfa-2a, alfa-2b, and beta-1a) did not improve outcomes in critically ill patients with MERS.28Arabi YM Shalhoub S Mandourah Y et al.Ribavirin and interferon therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: a multicentre observational study.Clin Infect Dis. 2020; 70: 1837-1844Google Scholar Thus, the repurposing of this triple combination of modestly active lopinavir–ritonavir, interferon beta-1b, and ribavirin for the treatment of this novel pandemic virus should be a reasonable therapeutic approach. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in ex-vivo infected human lung tissues compared with 2003 SARS-CoV.29Chu H Chan JF-W Wang Y et al.Comparative replication and immune activation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in human lungs: an ex vivo study with implications for the pathogenesis of COVID-19.Clin Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1093/cid/ciaa410Google Scholar Thus, the use of interferon beta-1b treatment to jump-start or improve the antiviral response of patients would be a logical approach. Additionally, interferon beta-1b was shown to decrease virus-induced lung fibrosis in a mouse model, which might improve outcomes of patients with COVID-19 complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome.30Luckhardt TR Commes SM Trujillo G et al.TLR9-induced interferon β is associated with protection from gammaherpesvirus-induced exacerbation of lung fibrosis.Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair. 2011; 4: 18Google Scholar Despite the concern of major side-effects arising from a combination of three drugs, no significant differences in incidence of adverse events between treatment groups were reported in our cohort of 127 patients. No haemolysis occurred from the short duration of low dose ribavirin. We did not use triple combination for patients who started treatment 7 days or more after symptom onset because of the concerns about the proinflammatory side-effects of interferon beta-1b, despite that at most three doses were used for each patient. Liver dysfunction was observed in about 14% of these patients and it was mild and self-limiting, except in one patient in the control group, in whom the biochemical hepatitis warranted the discontinuation of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment. Our study had several limitations. This trial was open label, without a placebo group, and confounded by a subgroup omitting interferon beta-1b within the combination group, depending on time from symptom onset. A subsequent phase 3 trial with interferon beta-1b as a backbone treatment with a placebo control group should be considered, because subgroup comparison suggested that interferon beta-1b appears to be a key component of our combination treatment. Our absence of critically ill patients did not allow the generalisation of our findings to severe cases. Triple antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin were safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in shortening virus shedding, alleviating symptoms, and facilitating discharge of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

The investigators enrolled 127 patients with COVID-19 admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong. Median age of patients was 52 years (IQR 32–62) and 68 [54%] were men; 86 were assigned to the combination group and 41 to the control group. Treatment duration was 14 days. Interferon beta-1b was given in the combination group only to patients who were enrolled less than 7 days after onset of symptoms, for a maximum of three doses by the end of the first week of symptoms. The primary endpoint was time to negative nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and secondary endpoints were time to symptom resolution by achieving a national early warning score 2 (NEWS2) of 0, a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 0, 30-day mortality, and duration of hospital stay. Triple therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the duration of viral shedding (time to negative nasopharyngeal swab 7 days [IQR 5–11] in the combination group vs 12 days [8–15] in the control group; hazard ratio [HR] 4·37 [95% CI 1·86–10·24]), symptom alleviation (time to NEWS2 0 of 4 days [IQR 3–8] vs 8 days [7–9]; HR 3·92 [1·66–9·23]), and duration of hospital stay (9·0 days [7·0–13·0] vs 14·5 days [9·3–16·0]; HR 2·72 [1·2–6·13]). This significant difference was sustained in a subgroup analysis of patients who were enrolled within less than 7 days of symptom onset (52 patients in the combination group, who received interferon beta-1b, vs 24 in the control group) but not in the subgroup of patients enrolled later than 7 days from symptom onset (34 patients in the combination group, who only received lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin, vs 17 in the control group). Most published studies so far have been retrospective or observational. Therefore, this prospective, randomised controlled design adds notable value to the growing evidence on treatments, eliminating a number of limitations inherent to retrospective studies. Additionally, despite the relatively small number of patients in the interferon beta-1b subgroup, significant differences in outcomes were demonstrated. Therefore, this study provides much needed data on a potential therapeutic regimen for SARS-CoV-2. It is important to note that the studied population had mild or moderate disease at the time of enrolment, evidenced by a median NEWS2 of 2 and SOFA score of 0, and there was no mortality in either group. Whether similar results are reproducible in populations with severe COVD-19 is unknown and should be explored in future studies.

The use of placebo as a control in the absence of proven effective therapy is therefore ideal. Additionally, earlier enrolment to standardise the number of interferon beta-1b doses is important but might be impractical, particularly because patients might not present to hospitals earlier than 7 days, when symptoms typically worsen.11Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062Google Scholar This study presents a step towards finding a much-needed therapy for SARS-CoV-2.

This disruption of routine health services and medical supplies risks increasing morbidity, disability, and avoidable mortality over time in NCD patients. Additionally, patients with severe obesity who require intensive care have increased patient management needs.6WHONoncommunicable diseases in emergencies.

International Diabetes Federation,        Brussels2019Google Scholar Communities and health systems need to be adaptive to both support and manage the increased risks of people with known NCDs and exercise sensitivity about the vulnerability of the large population with undiagnosed NCDs and those at increased risk of NCDs. The COVID-19 response and continued and strengthened focus on NCD prevention and management are key and interlinked aspects of public health at the present time. If the COVID-19 response is not adapted to encompass prevention and management of NCD risks, we will fail many people at a time when their vulnerability is heightened. What steps should be taken to adapt the COVID-19 response?

DOI:10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30228-9,10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30228-9,News,Evidence mounts on the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on ethnic minorities," As the cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continue to increase across the world, evidence is continuing to emerge that the pandemic could be disproportionately affecting people from black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. In the UK, this trend first came to public attention during media reports that showed the first 11 doctors who sadly lost their lives to COVID-19, were all from BAME communities. Following this, various analyses have been published, with one showing that of 106 COVID-19 fatalities in health workers some two thirds (63%) were in BAME people (up to April 22, 2020). The figure was 94% for doctors and 71% for nurses, with the average reduced with the inclusion of other health-care workers (55%). The UK's Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre data, up to April 30, shows that of 6574 patients with COVID-19 in intensive care, one third were from non-white ethnic groups; ethnic minorities make up only 13% of the population as a whole. However, data released by NHS England on April 19 showed that of 13 918 patients in hospitals in England who had tested positive for COVID-19 at time of death, 73·6% were white and 16·2% were of BAME ethnicity—more representative of the proportion of BAME people in the general population. “The problem is that data on deaths and serious illness from COVID-19 among the health-care workforce and their ethnicity is not being routinely published by the government”, explains Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the British Medical Association (BMA) council chair and a general practitioner (GP) in north London, UK. “However, it is a clear and consistent theme from the reports and what we know about those who have died so far, that a disproportionate number of those health-care workers who have tragically lost their lives are from BAME communities.” The UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced that there will be a review into the impact of COVID-19 on BAME communities, led by NHS England and Public Health England (PHE). The UK Government subsequently confirmed that the review will also analyse the effect of gender and obesity, as well as ethnicity. “While the review speaks of looking at existing health data, the BMA believes it is also vital to collect detailed data around occupation for all health-care workers who contract the infection, given that more than 150 are reported to have died, including at least 16 doctors, of whom 94% are from BAME origin”, says Nagpaul. “It is important to ascertain whether there are any occupational factors that have played a part in these health-care workers contracting the virus so that we can learn how to put in place measures to protect all health-care workers.” He adds that many factors affecting the wider ethnic minority community apply to ethnic minority doctors, such as the greater prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease, which are thought to increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. “We also know that a large proportion of BAME doctors work in staff grade, specialist, and associate specialist roles, which are crucial, patient-facing roles that are invaluable for the running of the NHS”, adds Nagpaul. “Workplace factors could have a part to play too; for example, a recent BMA survey has found that BAME doctors were twice as likely as white doctors to feel pressured to see patients in high-risk settings without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). Other BMA research revealed that BAME doctors are twice as likely not to feel confident to raise concerns about safety in the workplace compared with their white colleagues.” Nagpaul raised all these concerns in a letter to Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, and days later, on April 29, 2020, NHS England wrote to all hospital trusts across England—as well as ambulance services, mental health trusts, and organisations providing community health—asking them to risk assess their BAME workers and where necessary reassign them to duties that leave them less at risk of contracting COVID-19. On May 1, 2020, the UK's Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) published its report, which found that people from ethnic minorities are more likely to live in areas badly affected by COVID-19 infection. However, despite people from ethnic minorities being younger on average than the white British population, and therefore theoretically less susceptible to infection, they were found to have higher death rates. After adjusting for age, sex, and geography, the authors of the IFS report found that the death rate for people of black African descent was 3·5 times higher than for white British people, while for those of black Caribbean and Pakistani descent, death rates were 1·7 times and 2·7 times higher, respectively. In the USA, early data suggest that African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In a preliminary study of data compiled from hospitals in 14 US states, African Americans represented 33% of COVID-19 hospitalisations, despite only making up 18% of the total population studied. In another analysis, among COVID-19 deaths for which race and ethnicity data were available, death rates from COVID-19 in New York City (NY, USA) among black or African American people (92·3 deaths per 100 000 population) and Hispanic or Latino people (74·3) were substantially higher than that of white (45·2) or Asian (34·5) people. “Studies are underway to confirm these data and understand and potentially reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minorities”, a spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed to The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. Chronic conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, hypertension, kidney disease, and obesity, are all more common in African American than white populations; all of these conditions have been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19. However, the CDC states many other factors could be involved, such as people from ethnic minorities being more likely to live in more densely populated areas and housing, to use public transport more, and to work in lower paid service jobs without sick pay, meaning they would be more likely to go to work under all circumstances, increasing the risk of exposure. “I do not think that the pattern we are seeing in COVID-19 deaths for African Americans is solely due to pre-existing health conditions”, says Thomas A LaVeist, Dean of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA. “Race disparities in those diseases are not large enough to fully explain the COVID-19 death disparity. For example, there are no racial differences in obesity among men. Also, especially in the southern US states, white people also have extremely high rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and the other chronic diseases.” LaVeist says it is difficult to have definitive views on the cause of ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality until the overall infection rate has been established in different racial groups. “Are African Americans more likely to have been exposed to the virus? They seem to be more likely than others to work in jobs that place them at risk, such as check-out clerks and delivery drivers, and less likely to have jobs that allow them to work from home.” He adds that most southern states with larger ethnic minority populations have declined to expand Medicaid, which has reduced the number of poorer residents with regular access to primary health care. “Each of these factors, many of them the result of policy decisions, play a role in producing disproportionate death rates among African Americans”, he says. In Australia, steps have been taken to protect Indigenous Australians living in remote and rural locations, mainly through the introduction of extremely strict limitations on travel in or out of these communities. “It's important to stress that the majority of Indigenous Australians live in urban or regional areas—large and small cities mainly on the coast of Australia. While a lot of focus is on remote communities, a high proportion of Indigenous Australians in urban and regional areas have the same elevated risk of serious COVID-19 illness due to multiple chronic conditions and are at risk of rapid spread due to a high prevalence of overcrowding”, explains Jason Agostino, medical advisor to the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation and Lecturer in General Practice at the Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia. At the time of writing, Australia's latest COVID-19 epidemiology report (including data up to April 26, 2020) showed there were only 52 cases of COVID-19 among Indigenous Australians, representing less than 1% of Australia's cases despite Indigenous Australians being 3·3% of the population. “So far there have not been any cases in Indigenous Australians in remote or very remote regions”, explains Agostino. “Through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander COVID-19 Advisory Group and other forums we are able to identify strategies to address community priorities. An early and positive step to prevent spread was the additional travel restrictions put in place for many remote communities at the request of community leaders.” However, institutional problems remain, in particular some communities have overcrowded housing and have no facilities to safely isolate and quarantine infected or suspected cases. “There has also been insufficient support to enable health-care staff to quarantine before entering remote communities. If a health service wants to enforce the 14-day quarantine for locum staff, they have to bear that cost”, says Agostino. Should an outbreak occur, protocols have been developed for early transfer of cases and their close contacts out of communities and into regional centres, and the Australian Federal Government recently announced additional funding for retrieval services. The risks of COVID-19 to Indigenous communities could not be clearer. More than 1 in 3 Indigenous Australian adults report having either cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or renal disease, and onset of these diseases often occurs 20 years earlier than the non-Indigenous population. Smoking rates are also much higher, with approximately 40% of adults smoking, more than double that seen in the non-Indigenous population. “The 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic showed what can happen to Indigenous Australians”, says Agostino. “During that outbreak, rates of admission to the intensive care unit and mortality were some 4-times higher in Indigenous Australians compared with the non-Indigenous population.” He concludes that “while Australia's Federal and State and Territory Governments have put in place some good measures, the success so far is due to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people taking the lead and protecting their communities. Indigenous Australians began a network of community-controlled health organisations in the 1970s and this so-called whole of community, whole of person approach to health care is what is helping protect them in this early stage of the pandemic.” View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Jim West/Science Photo Library View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Jim West/Science Photo Library",2020-05-08 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Negative serum galactomannan might indicate that Aspergillus spp hyphae are unable to cause angioinvasive growth and release galactomannan into the blood. Most patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis did not have European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORTC/MSGERC) host factors, because only two (15%) of 13 had haematological malignancy as underlying disease.3Wang H Ding Y Li X Yang L Zhang W Kang W Fatal aspergillosis in a patient with SARS who was treated with corticosteroids.N Engl J Med. 2003; 349: 507-508Google Scholar Absence of host factors was also apparent in influenza-associated disease, in which 57% of patients could not be classified according to the EORTC/MSGERC consensus definition or the AspICU algorithm for patients in ICUs.

During the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, only four cases of proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were reported among 8422 probable SARS cases.3Wang H Ding Y Li X Yang L Zhang W Kang W Fatal aspergillosis in a patient with SARS who was treated with corticosteroids.N Engl J Med. 2003; 349: 507-508Google Scholar Because all four invasive pulmonary aspergillosis cases were associated with concomitant corticosteroid therapy, coronavirus infection itself might not increase the risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but other risk factors might have. Bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan testing is important to diagnose invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in the ICU and high galactomannan levels (galactomannan index >2·5) were observed in patients with presumed COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis.5Koehler P Cornely OA Böttiger BW et al.COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis.Mycoses. 2020;  (published online April 27.)DOI:10.1111/myc.13096Google Scholar However, only a restricted role for bronchoscopy has been recommended in COVID-19, because it is an aerosol-generating procedure that poses risks to patients and personnel.11Wahidi MM Lamb C Murgu S et al.American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) statement on the use of bronchoscopy and respiratory specimen collection in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.J Bronchology Interv Pulmonol. 2020;  (published online March 18.)DOI:10.1097/LBR.0000000000000681Google Scholar Collection of upper respiratory samples is the preferred method for diagnosis, and tracheal aspirates and non-bronchoscopic alveolar lavage in intubated patients.11Wahidi MM Lamb C Murgu S et al.American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) statement on the use of bronchoscopy and respiratory specimen collection in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.J Bronchology Interv Pulmonol. 2020;  (published online March 18.)DOI:10.1097/LBR.0000000000000681Google Scholar Although Aspergillus spp can be detected in sputum and tracheal aspirates in patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, its presence might reflect oral pharyngeal colonisation because Aspergillus spp is considered a core component of the basal oral mycobiome. Furthermore, galactomannan testing is not validated for upper respiratory tract specimens. Bronchoscopy is recommended in COVID-19 only when the intervention is considered lifesaving, which includes secondary infectious causes.11Wahidi MM Lamb C Murgu S et al.American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) statement on the use of bronchoscopy and respiratory specimen collection in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.J Bronchology Interv Pulmonol. 2020;  (published online March 18.)DOI:10.1097/LBR.0000000000000681Google Scholar Radiological and clinical signs of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in non-neutropenic patients are mostly unspecific and bronchoscopy is thus indicated in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are suspected of secondary infection, including fungal diagnostic work-up. Even if evidence for Aspergillus spp is recovered, uncertainty remains about whether patients truly develop invasive disease and require antifungal therapy. Indeed, eight of the nine patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis from France were not treated with antifungal drugs, and the three deaths were considered not to be related to aspergillosis, but clinically attributed to bacterial septic shock.3Wang H Ding Y Li X Yang L Zhang W Kang W Fatal aspergillosis in a patient with SARS who was treated with corticosteroids.N Engl J Med. 2003; 349: 507-508Google Scholar Autopsies were not performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis. It is therefore crucial to gain insight into the interaction between Aspergillus spp and the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung (panel). Only histopathology can prove invasive pulmonary aspergillosis through autopsy of deceased patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis. If autopsy is precluded because of the risk of aerosol formation, post-mortem lung biopsy might be considered as an alternative to obtaining tissue. Until histopathological evidence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis is obtained, we believe that patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill with evidence for Aspergillus spp in bronchoalveolar lavage or serum should receive antifungal therapy according to national and international guidelines.PanelCrucial next research questions for COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosisDiagnosis of CAPA•What is the positive predictive value of culture isolation of Aspergillus species in samples from the upper respiratory tract (infections vs colonisation)?•In light of low sensitivity of serum galactomannan, are there alternative blood tests for CAPA?

An area of concern is the impending crisis of domestic violence—gender-based violence and child abuse and neglect, due to movement restrictions, loss of income, isolation, overcrowding, and stress and anxiety, all which put women and children at a disproportionally increased risk of harm.1WHOJoint Leader's statement - Violence against children: a hidden crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/08-04-2020-joint-leader-s-statement---violence-against-children-a-hidden-crisis-of-the-covid-19-pandemicDate: 2020Date accessed: April 11, 2020Google Scholar This increased risk is not surprising. Previous epidemics, such as the Ebola virus disease outbreak in west Africa,2International Rescue CommitteeEverything on her shoulders: rapid assessment on gender and violence against women and girls in the Ebola outbreak in Beni. DRC,        March 15, 2019https://www.rescue.org/report/everything-her-shoulders-rapid-assessment-gender-and-violence-against-women-and-girls-ebolaDate accessed: April 11, 2020Google Scholar but also cholera and Zika virus disease outbreaks, led to regional environments where domestic violence became more prevalent; there were reductions in funding for specialist gender-based violence public health services; and, for survivors of gender-based violence, there was reduced access to health-care services. Although we are not aware of published studies to date that have tracked the national trends in gender-based violence related to COVID-19, initial reports from UK support services such as the National Domestic Abuse helpline have already shown increases in service use, a pattern seen elsewhere (with notable examples in China, Spain, and France).3Taub A A new COVID-19 crisis: Domestic abuse rises worldwide. The New York Times,        April 6, 2020https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/world/coronavirus-domestic-violence.htmlDate accessed: May 6, 2020Google Scholar In the UK, before the coronavirus crisis, gender-based violence was already deemed as highly prevalent, associated with substantial negative downstream social, psychological, and physical outcomes.4Chandan JS Thomas T Gokhale KM Bandyopadhyay S Taylor J Nirantharakumar K The burden of mental ill health associated with childhood maltreatment in the UK, using The Health Improvement Network database: a population-based retrospective cohort study.Lancet Psychiatry. 2019; 6: 926-934Google Scholar Therefore, any resultant increases in the rates of domestic violence would not only be a further travesty of human rights but also be associated with further long-term costs to society, which might be irreparable beyond the immediate threat of COVID-19. It has never been more important than now to implement a public health approach to gender-based violence in the UK. Similar to an approach that has been put in use to improve the management of physical violence in cities such as Cardiff, Glasgow, and London, the principles of a public health approach should be implemented to support survivors of gender-based violence. The WHO public health approach consists of four steps, which we have suggested the adaptation of to aid in the prevention of domestic violence during this pandemic (appendix).5Violence Prevention AllianceThe public health approach. World Health Organization,        2011https://www.who.int/violenceprevention/approach/public_health/en/Date accessed: December 14, 2019Google Scholar Without adequate surveillance, it is not possible to capture the burden of domestic violence during this pandemic. Because of selection biases, administrative datasets have consistently shown underestimates in the expected rates of domestic violence.6Everson MD Smith JB Hussey JM et al.Concordance between adolescent reports of childhood abuse and child protective service determinations in an at-risk sample of young adolescents.Child Maltreat. 2008; 13: 14-26Google Scholar Potential approaches to improve the surveillance of domestic violence could include the routine inquiry (feasibly integrated into remote primary care consultations or active syndromic surveillance from local health protection teams) and the urgent implementation of linked datasets between police and health records datasets to identify individuals at risk. Enhancing surveillance would also provide the opportunity to offer targeted support and interventions. Though formal evaluations of current interventions have not yet taken place during the pandemic, national charities (such as, but not limited to, Women's Aid, Safelives, and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty against Children) have produced guidance for how survivors can both report violence, abuse, and neglect and keep themselves safe, including information on remote reporting and support mechanisms. There are substantial gaps in the literature relating to the surveillance and evaluation of effective interventions to support those at risk of domestic violence, child abuse and neglect during this pandemic. The medical profession has a duty to provide support in overcoming these problems—to provide a public health approach to supporting those most vulnerable in society.

In this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food.MethodsWe modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9·8–51·9% and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10–50%. Although our scenarios are hypothetical, we sought to reflect real-world possibilities, given emerging reports of the supply-side and demand-side effects of the pandemic. We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths under each scenario, in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.FindingsOur least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9·8–18·5% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39·3–51·9% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9·8–44·7% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8·3–38·6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18–23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths.InterpretationOur estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada.

We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Our least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9·8–18·5% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39·3–51·9% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9·8–44·7% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8·3–38·6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18–23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths. Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada.

Previous infectious disease outbreaks indirectly resulted in increases in mortality caused by reductions in the provision and use of routine health services. Notably, the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic resulted in a 27·6 percentage point decrease in service use and 44·3 percentage point decrease in inpatient services in high-incidence areas of west Africa.

Already with COVID-19 we are seeing similar disruptions. The pandemic and the response to the pandemic are affecting both the provision and utilisation of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) services. Amid the pandemic, health workers, equipment, and facilities have been reassigned to address the influx of patients with COVID-19.12Gilbert M Pullano G Pinotti F et al.Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against importations of COVID-19: a modelling study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 871-877SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (24)Google Scholar Restructuring of the health system could result in the closure of peripheral health facilities, as seen in the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak.13Brolin Ribacke KJ Saulnier DD Eriksson A von Schreeb J Effects of the west Africa Ebola virus disease on health-care utilization—a systematic review.Front Public Health. 2016; 4: 222CrossrefGoogle Scholar The health workforce has been further reduced by nosocomial COVID-19 infection and burnout.14Ji Y Ma Z Peppelenbosch MP Pan Q Potential association between COVID-19 mortality and health-care resource availability.Lancet Glob Health. 2020; 8: e480SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (21)Google Scholar RMNCH interventions delivered through campaigns (eg, vaccinations, bednets, or vitamin A) are being paused or reduced in scale.15WHOGuiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The low buying power of LMICs and their lack of infrastructure for domestic production are disadvantageous in ensuring a steady supply chain. Global reserves and international procurement mechanisms for essential RMNCH medicines could mitigate shortages;16WHOCOVID-19.

In addition, local efforts to contain COVID-19 are likely to negatively impact domestic medical supply chains. Governments are restricting population movement by closing borders, reducing public transport, halting non-essential activities, and issuing shelter-in-place orders. These restrictions are negatively affecting economies. Lost income, increased prices, and overburdened social safety nets will push vulnerable groups further into poverty and increase financial and other barriers to health-care access. Movement restrictions will reduce physical access, exacerbated by reduced transport availability and the real or perceived threat of prosecution for travelling in public spaces.17Ratcliffe R Teargas, beatings and bleach: the most extreme Covid-19 lockdown controls around the world.https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/01/extreme-coronavirus-lockdown-controls-raise-fears-for-worlds-poorestDate: April 1, 2020Date accessed: April 9, 2020Google Scholar Demand for RMNCH services might decline as concerns over COVID-19 transmission alter the perceived risk–benefit calculation for individuals deciding to seek care. In many settings, the broader socioeconomic effects of the pandemic will exacerbate food insecurity. Increased poverty, and disrupted food and agriculture systems, will increase reliance on staple foods and restrict access to diverse and nutritious diets. Given these developments, it seems reasonable to expect disruption to maternal and child health services and increased undernutrition in the coming months. In many LMICs, maternal and child mortality remains high, and hard-won gains could falter without continued attention. Practitioners are already voicing such concerns.18UNStill ‘early days’ to assess COVID-19 impact on women, children—UNICEF official.https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059732Date: March 18, 2020Date accessed: April 22, 2020Google Scholar WHO released operational guidance for maintaining essential health services and adapting service delivery platforms to avoid interruptions.3WHOCOVID-19: operational guidance for maintaining essential health services during an outbreak.https://www.who.int/publications-detail/covid-19-operational-guidance-for-maintaining-essential-health-services-during-an-outbreakDate accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar Statistical modelling can help to inform policy decisions related to the pandemic. Models have already been used to estimate the direct effects of COVID-19, including on pregnant women and infants.19Schwartz DA Graham AL Potential maternal and infant outcomes from coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) infecting pregnant women: lessons from SARS, MERS, and other human coronavirus infections.Viruses. 2020; 12: E194CrossrefPubMedScopus (0)Google Scholar In this study, we add to existing models by estimating the indirect effects of the pandemic on maternal and child mortality in LMICs. While it is still early in the pandemic, a set of realistic, quantifiable estimates will provide a reference point for decision makers currently weighing response strategies. We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to estimate additional deaths due to reduced coverage of interventions, and increased prevalence of wasting, under three scenarios and for three time periods. To develop our assumptions, we adopted a simple health systems framework (figure 1). The framework assumes that four health system components affect coverage of services: availability of health workers, availability of supplies and equipment, demand for services, and access to services. In our analysis, coverage assumes that an intervention is delivered with sufficient quality to achieve its intended health effect.20Marsh AD Muzigaba M Diaz T et al.Effective coverage measurement in maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition: progress, future prospects, and implications for quality health systems.Lancet Glob Health. 2020; 8: e730-e736SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFGoogle Scholar In our framework, availability of health workers and supplies address service readiness; however, other dimensions of service quality are not explicitly captured. Though simplistic, this framework gave us a structure with which to develop scenarios.Figure 1Framework for the effects of health system components on coverage of health servicesView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) We created three scenarios representing different possible futures that might unfold depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the response of governments. We sought to reflect real-world possibilities, based on past epidemics and media reports from the current pandemic. For each scenario, we developed assumptions for the four components in our framework, using the following reduction categories: none (0% reduction), small (5% reduction), moderate (10% reduction), and large (25% reduction). We assumed that provision of health services was a product of workforce and supplies, and that utilisation of health services was a product of demand and access. Coverage was assumed to be a product of provision of health services and utilisation of health services. We used a simple formula to translate component reductions to an overall coverage reduction: Coverage reduction=1-([1-workforce reduction])×[1-supplies reduction]×[1-demand reduction]×[1-access reduction] The intent of this calculation was to capture the idea that reductions in individual components will combine to produce a greater overall coverage reduction. A more comprehensive analysis would consider the interaction between components. In addition to coverage reductions, we assumed an increase in the proportion of children who are wasted (low weight for height). Although changes in stunting (low height for age) will only occur and affect mortality in the long term, changes in wasting will affect mortality immediately. For our three scenarios, we assumed 10%, 20%, and 50% relative increases in wasting prevalence, respectively. Given the complex causal pathways for nutrition, these assumptions are necessarily speculative. However, we believe we would miss a large number of potential child deaths if we did not model wasting. The World Food Programme has warned that the number of people facing food crises could double because of the pandemic, so our upper assumption of a 50% relative increase seems within reason.21World Food ProgrammeCOVID-19 will double number of people facing food crises unless swift action is taken.https://www.wfp.org/news/covid-19-will-double-number-people-facing-food-crises-unless-swift-action-takenDate: April 21, 2020Date accessed: April 22, 2020Google Scholar For scenario 1 (table 1), we assume small reductions in the availability of health workers and supplies due to the reallocation of resources to the pandemic response. We also assume small reductions in the demand for and access to routine health services, due to movement restrictions, fear of infection, and economic pressure. People become disinclined to seek care for interventions deemed more acceptable to delay or forego, such as antenatal, postnatal, and preventive interventions. Care seekers have difficulty accessing services due to reduced income for out-of-pocket expenses or travel costs.Table 1Component and coverage reductions for three scenariosWorkforce reductionSupplies reductionDemand reductionAccess reductionCoverage reductionScenario 1** In addition to coverage reductions, we assumed that the proportions of children with wasting would be increased by 10% in scenario 1, 20% in scenario 2, and 50% in scenario 3.Family planningNoneSmallNoneSmall9·8%Antenatal careSmallSmallSmallSmall18·5%Childbirth careSmallSmallNoneSmall14·3%Postnatal careSmallSmallSmallSmall18·5%Early child vaccinationsSmallSmallSmallSmall18·5%Early child preventiveNoneSmallSmallSmall14·3%Early child curativeSmallSmallNoneSmall14·3%Scenario 2** In addition to coverage reductions, we assumed that the proportions of children with wasting would be increased by 10% in scenario 1, 20% in scenario 2, and 50% in scenario 3.Family planningSmallModerateNoneSmall18·8%Antenatal careModerateModerateSmallSmall26·9%Childbirth careModerateModerateNoneSmall23·1%Postnatal careModerateModerateSmallSmall26·9%Early child vaccinationsModerateModerateSmallSmall26·9%Early child preventiveSmallModerateSmallSmall22·8%Early child curativeModerateModerateNoneSmall23·1%Scenario 3** In addition to coverage reductions, we assumed that the proportions of children with wasting would be increased by 10% in scenario 1, 20% in scenario 2, and 50% in scenario 3.Family planningModerateModerateNoneLarge39·3%Antenatal careLargeModerateSmallLarge51·9%Childbirth careLargeModerateNoneLarge49·4%Postnatal careLargeModerateSmallLarge51·9%Early child vaccinationsLargeModerateSmallLarge51·9%Early child preventiveModerateModerateSmallLarge42·3%Early child curativeLargeModerateNoneLarge49·4%Small=5% reduction.

Open table in a new tab                         Small=5% reduction. Moderate=10% reduction. Large=25% reduction. In scenario 2 (table 1), we assume greater disruptions to health systems due to workforce and supply chain issues. Some health workers are diverted to COVID-19 activities, while others become sick or are overwhelmed. Workforce shortages have a greater effect on interventions requiring skilled care (eg, antenatal, childbirth, and curative services); other interventions (eg, contraceptives and preventive services) are less dependent on skilled workers and can more easily be provided by lay health workers. Domestic supply chains are disrupted due to local bottlenecks, resulting in reduced availability of hormonal contraceptives, antenatal supplementation and malaria prevention, commodities for childbirth (eg, uterotonics, corticosteroids, or magnesium sulfate), routine child vaccines, and treatments for common childhood illnesses (eg, antibiotics, antimalarials, or oral rehydration solution). For scenario 3 (table 1), in addition to disruptions in the health system, we assume that governments impose strict movement restrictions, forcing families and non-essential workers to stay home. Those with respiratory symptoms or suspected COVID-19 exposure are required to self-isolate. While isolation and shelter-in-place restrictions do not prohibit care seeking, the restrictions reduce access indirectly. Lack of trust in the official health system, and fear of nosocomial infection, prompts some individuals to stop seeking care or to seek care from alternative providers. Stay-at-home orders lead to greater lost income, reduced purchasing power, and inability to pay for services, compounding physical access issues. Travel becomes even more difficult for people who rely on public transport. Access restrictions felt by the broader public also affect health workers, further hampering the health workforce. We used LiST to estimate the additional deaths arising under each scenario. LiST is a causal model that estimates changes in mortality from changes in coverage of interventions.22Walker N Tam Y Friberg IK Overview of the lives saved tool (LiST).BMC Public Health. 2013; 13: S1CrossrefPubMedScopus (107)Google Scholar For 17 years, researchers and practitioners have used LiST to estimate the impacts of health programmes.23Stegmuller AR Self A Litvin K Roberton T How is the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) used in the global health community? Results of a mixed-methods LiST user study.BMC Public Health. 2017; 17: 773CrossrefScopus (6)Google Scholar One of LiST's strengths is its ability to model the effects of simultaneous changes in 77 interventions along the RMNCH continuum of care, including interventions related to antenatal, childbirth, and postnatal periods, and preventive and curative interventions in early childhood. Through its link to modules on demography and family planning, LiST also estimates the effects of changes in contraceptive prevalence and fertility. More information about LiST and its methodology is provided in the appendix (p 2). We ran our models for 118 of the LMICs tracked by the Countdown to 2030 initiative (appendix p 5).24Boerma T Requejo J Victora CG et al.Countdown to 2030: tracking progress towards universal coverage for reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health.Lancet. 2018; 391: 1538-1548SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (65)Google Scholar By our estimates, these countries account for 97·7% of global deaths in children younger than 5 years and 99·6% of global maternal deaths.25UNICEFWHOWorld Bank GroupUNLevels and trends in child mortality 2019: estimates developed by the UN Inter-agency Group for child mortality estimation.https://www.unicef.org/reports/levels-and-trends-child-mortality-report-2019Date: September, 2019Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar,  26WHOUNICEFUNFPAWorld Bank GroupUN Population DivisionTrends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2017.

The number of additional deaths in our results represents the increase in deaths compared with a counterfactual of no change in the coverage of interventions or risk factors. We report deaths due to reduced coverage and risk factors only; we do not report deaths arising from an increase in population size from increased fertility driven by reduced contraceptive prevalence, although we do expect these effects in the long term. A link to all our LiST projection files is provided in the appendix (p 1). We included all interventions in LiST for the categories in table 1. We did not include interventions related to breastfeeding or water and sanitation, as we assumed only a marginal reduction in these activities. As mentioned above, we included wasting, but we did not model stunting, as stunting will not occur in the short term and therefore has no immediate impact on mortality. In LiST, the effect of wasting on mortality is modelled indirectly as a risk factor that increases the likelihood of dying from other infectious causes. We did not include HIV because of the complexity of delivery systems for HIV prevention and treatment, and because HIV accounts for only a small proportion of global child deaths. Across scenarios, we assumed similar reductions in vaccination coverage as other preventive health services (ie, antenatal and postnatal care). However, we anticipate that herd protection offered by high population vaccination coverage for rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines will attenuate the effect of temporary reductions. We applied two assumptions in estimating the herd effect of these vaccines. First, 15% of vaccine-preventable child deaths occur in countries that do not have sufficient vaccination coverage for substantial herd protection (eg, Nigeria)27Wahl B O'Brien KL Greenbaum A et al.Burden of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b disease in children in the era of conjugate vaccines: global, regional, and national estimates for 2000–15.Lancet Glob Health. 2018; 6: e744-e757SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (101)Google Scholar and would experience the full immediate effects of decreased vaccination. Second, in countries with higher vaccination coverage, 80% of the unvaccinated cohort would remain protected by the herd effect.28Carter ED Tam Y Walker N Impact of vaccination delay on deaths averted by pneumococcal conjugate vaccine: Modeled effects in 8 country scenarios.Vaccine. 2019; 37: 5242-5249CrossrefPubMedScopus (1)Google Scholar Because of the scarcity of evidence on the herd protection offered by meningococcal A vaccine and diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis vaccine, and the high coverage threshold for herd protection for measles vaccine, we did not attenuate the effects of these vaccines; rather, we assumed the full effect of the coverage reduction on mortality. The funders of the study had no role in study design, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Table 2 shows the estimated additional maternal and child deaths for each scenario among all 118 countries. These numbers represent the deaths due specifically to the reductions in coverage and increase in wasting—ie, deaths that would not occur if coverage and wasting instead stayed constant. We report child deaths excluding and including the effects of increased wasting. The estimates are reported for a 1-month period (per month) and extrapolated for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month periods. The estimates do not reflect deaths during transition periods in which coverage is decreasing or returning to baseline. The number of additional deaths increases with the severity of the coverage reductions and wasting increases, with scenario 1 (smallest reductions) resulting in an additional 2030 maternal deaths and 42 240 child deaths per month, and scenario 3 (greatest reductions) resulting in an additional 9450 maternal deaths and 192 830 child deaths per month.

Table 3, Table 4 show the contributions of individual interventions to total additional maternal and child deaths. This ranking is driven by the country-specific baseline coverage of each intervention, by the assumed coverage reductions for each intervention in our scenarios, and by the strength of each intervention on averting mortality (based on intervention efficacy and underlying country-specific causes of mortality). The reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (namely, parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments, which reduce mortality due to post-partum haemorrhage, maternal sepsis, and eclampsia) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths (table 3). In children, an increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18–23% of additional deaths, depending on the scenario, while reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths (table 4).Table 3Additional maternal deaths per month by intervention among all modelled countries (n=118)CategoryAdditional maternal deathsScenario 1Scenario 2Scenario 3Total additional deaths..203036009450Parenteral administration of uterotonicsChildbirth557 (28%)1008 (28%)2775 (29%)Parenteral administration of antibioticsChildbirth236 (12%)433 (12%)1245 (13%)Parenteral administration of anticonvulsantsChildbirth194 (10%)351 (10%)968 (10%)Clean birth environmentChildbirth180 (9%)328 (9%)931 (10%)Contraceptive useFamily planning130 (6%)247 (7%)514 (5%)Magnesium sulfate management of pre-eclampsiaAntenatal135 (7%)212 (6%)483 (5%)Micronutrient supplementation (iron and multiple micronutrients)Antenatal101 (5%)159 (4%)361 (4%)Antibiotics for preterm or prolonged premature rupture of membranesChildbirth78 (4%)143 (4%)411 (4%)Manual removal of placentaChildbirth50 (3%)90 (3%)245 (3%)Removal of retained products of conceptionChildbirth46 (2%)82 (2%)223 (2%)Hypertensive disorder case managementAntenatal51 (3%)80 (2%)182 (2%)Blood transfusionChildbirth41 (2%)73 (2%)198 (2%)Households protected from malaria (insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying)Antenatal39 (2%)70 (2%)152 (2%)Safe abortion servicesFamily planning29 (1%)67 (2%)193 (2%)Tetanus toxoid vaccinationAntenatal37 (2%)59 (2%)135 (1%)Malaria case managementAntenatal30 (2%)48 (1%)111 (1%)Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancyAntenatal28 (1%)43 (1%)102 (1%)Assisted vaginal deliveryChildbirth22 (1%)39 (1%)99 (1%)Caesarean deliveryChildbirth17 (1%)31 (1%)82 (1%)Data are n (% of total deaths).

Open table in a new tab                         Data are n (% of total deaths). Data are n (% of total deaths). Our analysis shows that if the COVID-19 pandemic results in widespread disruption to health systems and reduced access to food, LMICs can expect to see large increases in maternal and child deaths. Under our first scenario (coverage reductions of 9·8–18·5% and wasting increase of 10%), over 6 months there would be 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Under our third scenario (coverage reductions of 39·3–51·9% and wasting increase of 50%), over 6 months there would be 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These deaths would represent a 9·8–44·7% increase in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8·3–38·6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. We do not intend our estimates as a prediction. Instead, we aim to show what could happen under scenarios of differing severity and duration. If countries are successful in minimising disruptions to their health systems and maintaining utilisation of RMNCH services, the number of additional deaths will be at the smaller end of our estimates. Although this might seem obvious, we see three important messages that come from this exercise. First, the choices that governments make in responding to the pandemic will have consequences for maternal and child health. There has been debate around the trade-off between establishing movement restrictions and minimising disruptions to business and economies. Our results show that the indirect effects of the pandemic are not merely economic. If the delivery of health care is disrupted, many women and children will die. Thus, while public health experts are advocating for social distancing, there is also a public health case for ensuring access to routine care. Our estimates quantify the potential effect on RMNCH and provide a reference point for policy makers. Second, not all health interventions are similarly susceptible to disruption or have the same effect. As policy makers consider plans to reallocate staff and resources, they might need to prioritise interventions. In our scenarios, maintaining coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would save 60% of additional maternal deaths. Maintaining coverage of antibiotics for neonatal sepsis and pneumonia and oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would save 41% of additional child deaths. Disruption of these interventions—childbirth and child curative services—cannot be mitigated through post-outbreak activities or easily averted through vertical health programmes outside of the public health system. The vulnerability of these interventions to disruption, and their substantial consequences for mortality, highlight the need to ensure provision of these services throughout the pandemic and support citizens in using these services as safely as possible. In our scenarios, increases in childhood wasting accounted for 18–23% of additional child deaths. Although our assumptions for this were speculative, we are confident that, if wasting does increase, it will contribute greatly to child mortality. The drivers of wasting might lie outside of the health system, but there are interventions that health policy makers could consider (eg, ready-to-use therapeutic foods). More importantly, multisectoral action should be taken to mitigate increases in wasting by strengthening and expanding social safety nets and by supporting local food and agricultural systems. Thanks to country prioritisation and the efforts of initiatives such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, coverage of essential child immunisations is high in most LMICs. This high coverage grants herd protection for some vaccine-preventable diseases, attenuating the immediate effects of coverage declines on mortality. However, even short gaps in vaccination coverage can result in overall declines in population coverage, and catch-up campaigns should be prioritised in the aftermath of the pandemic.15WHOGuiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interim guidance.https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331590/WHO-2019-nCoV-immunization_services-2020.1-eng.pdfDate: March 26, 2020Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar Third, once the pandemic is over, health systems must recover quickly. As life returns to normal, countries should advance resilient health systems and reinvigorate demand for routine care. The longer that coverage reductions continue, the more lives will be lost. Once care-seeking patterns are broken, they might be hard to reinstate. We should not delay in restoring health services as soon as possible if we are to minimise the lasting impact of otherwise temporary disruptions. We stress that our scenarios are meant as hypothetical futures, to show the potential effects on maternal and child mortality if they were to occur. We are still early in the pandemic, and our assumptions could prove to be too severe or too conservative. There is not yet reliable empirical data for the effect of the pandemic on health service provision or utilisation. Moreover, our understanding of what might be possible is based largely on experiences in high-income countries; the effects of the pandemic in LMICs, and the response to it, will probably be different.29Hopman J Allegranzi B Mehtar S Managing COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.JAMA. 2020; 3231549CrossrefScopus (5)Google Scholar For all these reasons, our results are intended to help understand the potential magnitude of the effect, not to offer exact or even approximate numbers. We applied the same assumptions to 118 countries, and in our above results we only report aggregate numbers. Country-specific estimates can be found in the appendix (p 443). We hesitate to showcase our estimates by country because we did not incorporate information on country-specific response strategies and, without this, deeper comparisons by country are limited. However, we recognise that the principal actors who need our estimates are national decision makers. We encourage those considering country-specific scenarios to use LiST, and the projection files provided in the appendix, to investigate the indirect effects of the pandemic using assumptions tailored to their context. LiST is constrained to a defined set of health-sector interventions, and does not estimate the effects of income, agriculture, or food markets on stunting and wasting (although changes to stunting and wasting can be entered directly). A more complex analysis might attempt to model these upstream factors. Similarly, a comprehensive analysis would consider in more detail the long-term effect of temporary reductions in vaccine coverage (assuming no catch-up campaigns), the long-term effect of fertility increases due to temporary reductions in contraceptive prevalence, and the additional deaths during a post-pandemic period in which coverage is returning to baseline. LiST does not capture individual infectious disease dynamics and therefore does not reflect the potential effects of secondary outbreaks in the absence of preventive interventions (eg, localised measles outbreaks due to a gap in measles vaccination), as modelled in other analyses.30Abbas KM Procter SR van Zandvoort K et al.Benefit-risk analysis of health benefits of routine childhood immunisation against the excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the Covid-19 pandemic in Africa. May 1, 2020 (preprint).https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/EPI-suspension.htmlDate accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar In general, we expect the pandemic to affect the health of women and children in more ways than we have captured, not fewer, including through causal pathways unknown to us now. If our estimates are overly conservative, they still highlight the need to consider maternal and child health amid the pandemic and the consequences at stake.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed, up to April 10, 2020, for published clinical trials assessing the effect of remdesivir among patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The search terms used were (“COVID-19” or “2019-nCoV” or “SARS-CoV-2”) AND “remdesivir” AND (“clinical trial” or “randomized controlled trial”). We identified no published clinical trials of the effect of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.Added value of this studyOur study is the first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the effect of intravenous remdesivir in adults admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. The study was terminated before attaining the prespecified sample size. In the intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint of time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between groups, but was numerically shorter in the remdesivir group than the control group, particularly in those treated within 10 days of symptom onset. The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, although also not significantly different between groups, was numerically shorter in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients.Implications of all the available evidenceNo statistically significant benefits were observed for remdesivir treatment beyond those of standard of care treatment. Our trial did not attain the predetermined sample size because the outbreak of COVID-19 was brought under control in China. Future studies of remdesivir, including earlier treatment in patients with COVID-19 and higher-dose regimens or in combination with other antivirals or SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in those with severe COVID-19 are needed to better understand its potential effectiveness. Evidence before this study We searched PubMed, up to April 10, 2020, for published clinical trials assessing the effect of remdesivir among patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The search terms used were (“COVID-19” or “2019-nCoV” or “SARS-CoV-2”) AND “remdesivir” AND (“clinical trial” or “randomized controlled trial”). We identified no published clinical trials of the effect of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Added value of this study Our study is the first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the effect of intravenous remdesivir in adults admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. The study was terminated before attaining the prespecified sample size. In the intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint of time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between groups, but was numerically shorter in the remdesivir group than the control group, particularly in those treated within 10 days of symptom onset. The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, although also not significantly different between groups, was numerically shorter in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients.

Here, we report the results of a placebo-controlled randomised trial of remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19. This was an investigator-initiated, individually randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of intravenous remdesivir in adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. The trial was done at ten hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei, China). Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review boards of each participating hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, or their legal representative if they were unable to provide consent. The trial was done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol is available online. Eligible patients were men and non-pregnant women with COVID-19 who were aged at least 18 years and were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, had pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging, had oxygen saturation of 94% or lower on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and were within 12 days of symptom onset. Eligible patients of child-bearing age (men and women) agreed to take effective contraceptive measures (including hormonal contraception, barrier methods, or abstinence) during the study period and for at least 7 days after the last study drug administration. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breast feeding; hepatic cirrhosis; alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase more than five times the upper limit of normal; known severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min per 1·73 m2) or receipt of continuous renal replacement therapy, haemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis; possibility of transfer to a non-study hospital within 72 h; and enrolment into an investigational treatment study for COVID-19 in the 30 days before screening. The use of other treatments, including lopinavir–ritonavir, was permitted. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either the remdesivir group or the placebo group. Randomisation was stratified according to the level of respiratory support as follows: (1) no oxygen support or oxygen support with nasal duct or mask; or (2) high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The permuted block (30 patients per block) randomisation sequence, including stratification, was prepared by a statistician not involved in the trial using SAS software, version 9.4. Eligible patients were allocated to receive medication in individually numbered packs, according to the sequential order of the randomisation centre (Jin Yin-tan Hospital central pharmacy). Envelopes were prepared for emergency unmasking. Patients received either intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for a total of 10 days (both provided by Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA). Patients were assessed once daily by trained nurses using diary cards that captured data on a six-category ordinal scale and safety from day 0 to 28 or death. Other clinical data were recorded using the WHO–International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) case record form. The safety assessment included daily monitoring for adverse events, clinical laboratory testing (days 1, 3, 7, and 10), 12-lead electrocardiogram (days 1 and 14), and daily vital signs measurements. Clinical data were recorded on paper case record forms and then double entered into an electronic database and validated by trial staff. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, expectorated sputa as available, and faecal or anal swab specimens were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 for viral RNA detection and quantification. The trial was monitored by a contract research organisation (Hangzhou Tigermed Consulting). Virological testing was done at the Teddy Clinical Research Laboratory (Tigermed–DI'AN, Hangzhou, China) using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), detected and quantified by Cobas z480 qPCR (Roche), using LightMix Modular SARS-CoV-2 assays (TIB MOBIOL, Berlin, Germany). At baseline, the upper (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory tract specimens were tested for detection of E-gene, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, and N-gene, then samples on the subsequent visits were quantitatively and qualitative assessed for E-gene. The primary clinical endpoint was time to clinical improvement within 28 days after randomisation. Clinical improvement was defined as a two-point reduction in patients' admission status on a six-point ordinal scale, or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. The six-point scale was as follows: death=6; hospital admission for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation=5; hospital admission for non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy=4; hospital admission for oxygen therapy (but not requiring high-flow or non-invasive ventilation)=3; hospital admission but not requiring oxygen therapy=2; and discharged or having reached discharge criteria (defined as clinical recovery—ie, normalisation of pyrexia, respiratory rate <24 breaths per minute, saturation of peripheral oxygen >94% on room air, and relief of cough, all maintained for at least 72 h)=1. The six-point scale was modified from the seven-point scale used in our previous COVID-19 lopinavir–ritonavir RCT11Cao B Wang Y Wen D et al.A trial of lopinavir–ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online March 18.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2001282Google Scholar by combining the two outpatient strata into one. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of patients in each category of the six-point scale at day 7, 14, and 28 after randomisation; all-cause mortality at day 28; frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation; duration of oxygen therapy; duration of hospital admission; and proportion of patients with nosocomial infection. Virological measures included the proportions of patients with viral RNA detected and viral RNA load (measured by quantitative RT-PCR). Safety outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and premature discontinuations of study drug. The original design required a total of 325 events across both groups, which would provide 80% power under a one-sided type I error of 2·5% if the hazard ratio (HR) comparing remdesivir to placebo is 1·4, corresponding to a change in time to clinical improvement of 6 days assuming that time to clinical improvement is 21 days on placebo. One interim analysis using triangular boundaries23Whitehead J Stratton I Group sequential clinical trials with triangular continuation regions.Biometrics. 1983; 39: 227-236Google Scholar and a 2:1 allocation ratio between remdesivir and placebo had been accounted for in the original design. Assuming an 80% event rate within 28 days across both groups and a dropout rate of 10% implies that about 453 patients should be recruited for this trial (151 on placebo and 302 on remdesivir). The possibility for an interim analysis after enrolment of about 240 patients was included in the design if requested by the independent data safety and monitoring board. The primary efficacy analysis was done on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis with all randomly assigned patients. Time to clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28; no clinical improvement at day 28 or death before day 28 were considered as right censored at day 28. Time to clinical improvement was portrayed by Kaplan-Meier plot and compared with a log-rank test. The HR and 95% CI for clinical improvement and HR with 95% CI for clinical deterioration were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model. Other analyses include subgroup analyses for those receiving treatment 10 days or less vs more than 10 days after symptom onset, time to clinical deterioration (defined as one category increase or death), and for viral RNA load at entry. The differences in continuous variables between the groups was calculated using Hodges-Lehmann estimation. We present adverse event data on the patients' actual treatment exposure, coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Statistical analyses were done using SAS software, version 9.4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 255 patients were screened, of whom 237 were eligible (figure 1). 158 patients were assigned to receive remdesivir and 79 to receive placebo; one patient in the placebo group withdrew their previously written informed consent after randomisation, so 158 and 78 patients were included in the ITT population. No patients were enrolled after March 12, because of the control of the outbreak in Wuhan and on the basis of the termination criteria specified in the protocol, the data safety and monitoring board recommended that the study be terminated and data analysed on March 29. At this stage, the interim analysis was abandoned. When all the other assumptions stayed the same, with the actual enrolment of 236 participants, the statistical power was reduced from 80% to 58%.Figure 1Trial profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) Three patients in the remdesivir group did not start their assigned treatment so were not included in safety analyses (figure 1). The median age of study patients was 65 years (IQR 56–71); sex distribution was 89 (56%) men versus 69 (44%) women in the remdesivir group and 51 (65%) versus 27 (35%) in the placebo group (table 1). The most common comorbidity was hypertension, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease. Lopinavir–ritonavir was co-administered in 42 (18%) patients at baseline. Most patients were in category 3 of the six-point ordinal scale of clinical status at baseline. Some imbalances existed at enrolment between the groups, including more patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease in the remdesivir group than the placebo group. More patients in the control group than in the remdesivir group had been symptomatic for 10 days or less at the time of starting remdesivir or placebo treatment, and a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients had a respiratory rate of more than 24 breaths per min. No other major differences in symptoms, signs, laboratory results, disease severity, or treatments were observed between groups at baseline.Table 1Baseline patient characteristicsRemdesivir group (n=158)Placebo group (n=78)Age, years66·0 (57·0–73·0)64·0 (53·0–70·0)SexMen89 (56%)51 (65%)Women69 (44%)27 (35%)Any comorbidities112 (71%)55 (71%)Hypertension72 (46%)30 (38%)Diabetes40 (25%)16 (21%)Coronary heart disease15 (9%)2 (3%)Body temperature, °C36·8 (36·5–37·2)36·8 (36·5–37·2)Fever56 (35%)31 (40%)Respiratory rate >24 breaths per min36 (23%)11 (14%)White blood cell count, × 109 per LMedian6·2 (4·4–8·3)6·4 (4·5–8·3)4–10108/155 (70%)58 (74%)<427/155 (17%)12 (15%)>1020/155 (13%)8 (10%)Lymphocyte count, × 109 per L0·8 (0·6–1·1)0·7 (0·6–1·2)≥1·049/155 (32%)23 (29%)<1·0106/155 (68%)55 (71%)Platelet count, × 109 per L183·0 (144·0–235·0)194·5 (141·0–266·0)≥100148/155 (95%)75 (96%)<1007/155 (5%)3 (4%)Serum creatinine, μmol/L68·0 (56·0–82·0)71·3 (56·0–88·7)≤133151/154 (98%)76 (97%)>1333/154 (2%)2 (3%)Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L31·0 (22·0–44·0)33·0 (24·0–48·0)≤40109/155 (70%)49 (63%)>4046/155 (30%)29 (37%)Alanine aminotransferase, U/L26·0 (18·0–42·0)26·0 (20·0–43·0)≤50130/155 (84%)66 (85%)>5025/155 (16%)12 (15%)Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L339·0 (247·0–441·5)329·0 (249·0–411·0)≤24536/148 (24%)17/75 (23%)>245112/148 (76%)58/75 (77%)Creatine kinase, U/L75·9 (47·0–131·1)75·0 (47·0–158·0)≤185118/141 (84%)54/67 (81%)>18523/141 (16%)13/67 (19%)National Early Warning Score 2 level at day 15·0 (3·0–7·0)4·0 (3·0–6·0)Six-category scale at day 12—hospital admission, not requiring supplemental oxygen03 (4%)3—hospital admission, requiring supplemental oxygen129 (82%)65 (83%)4—hospital admission, requiring high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive mechanical ventilation28 (18%)9 (12%)5—hospital admission, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive mechanical ventilation01 (1%)6—death1 (1%)0Baseline viral load of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, log10 copies per mL4·7 (0·3)4·7 (0·4)Receiving interferon alfa-2b at baseline29 (18%)15 (19%)Receiving lopinavir–ritonavir at baseline27 (17%)15 (19%)Antibiotic treatment at baseline121 (77%)63 (81%)Corticosteroids therapy at baseline60 (38%)31 (40%)Data are median (IQR), n (%), n/N (%), or mean (SE).

Clinical improvement (the event) was defined as a decline of two categories on the modified seven-category ordinal scale of clinical status, or hospital discharge. OR=odds ratio. Adjusted hazard ratio for randomisation stratification was 1·25 (95% CI 0·88–1·78). *Including deaths before day 28 as right censored at day 28, the number of patients without clinical improvement was still included in the number at risk. Results for time to clinical improvement were similar in the per-protocol population (median 21·0 days [IQR 13·0–28·0] in the remdesivir group vs 23·0 days [15·0–28·0] in the placebo group HR 1·27 [95% CI 0·89–1·80]; appendix pp 2–3, 5). Although not statistically significant, in patients receiving remdesivir or placebo within 10 days of symptom onset in the ITT population, those receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo (median 18·0 days [IQR 12·0–28·0] vs 23·0 days [15·0–28·0]; HR 1·52 [0·95–2·43]; appendix p 6). If clinical improvement was defined as a one, instead of two, category decline, the HR was 1·34 with a 95% CI of 0·96–1·86 (appendix p 7). For time to clinical deterioration, defined as a one-category increase or death, the HR was 0·95 with a 95% CI of 0·55–1·64 (appendix p 8). 28-day mortality was similar between the two groups (22 [14%] died in the remdesivir group vs 10 (13%) in the placebo group; difference 1·1% [95% CI −8·1 to 10·3]). In patients with use of remdesivir within 10 days after symptom onset, 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the groups, although numerically higher in the placebo group; by contrast, in the group of patients with late use, remdesivir patients had numerically higher 28-day mortality, although there was no significant difference. Clinical improvement rates at days 14 and day 28 were also not significantly different between the groups, but numerically higher in the remdesivir group than the placebo group. For patients assigned to the remdesivir group, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was not significantly different, but numerically shorter than in those assigned to the control group; however, the number of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation was small. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in length of oxygen support, hospital length of stay, days from randomisation to discharge, days from randomisation to death and distribution of six-category scale at day 7, day 14, and day 28 (table 3; appendix p 9). Of 236 patients (158 in the remdesivir group and 78 in the placebo group) who were RT-PCR positive at enrolment, 37 (19%) of the 196 with data available had undetectable viral RNA on the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab taken at baseline. The mean baseline viral load of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs was 4·7 log10 copies per mL (SE 0·3) in the remdesivir group and 4·7 log10 copies per mL (0·4) in the control group (table 1). Viral load decreased over time similarly in both groups (figure 3A). No differences in viral load were observed when stratified by interval from symptom onset to start of study treatment (appendix p 10). In the subset of patients from whom expectorated sputa could be obtained (103 patients), the mean viral RNA load at enrolment was nearly 1-log higher in the remdesivir group than the placebo group at enrolment (figure 3B). When adjusted for baseline sputum viral load at enrolment, the remdesivir group showed no significant difference at day 5 from placebo, but a slightly more rapid decline in load (p=0·0672).Figure 3Viral load by quantitative PCR on the upper respiratory tract specimens (A) and lower respiratory tract specimens (B)Show full captionData are mean (SE).

The cumulative rate of undetectable viral RNA of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs by day 28 was 153 (78%) of 196 patients, and the negative proportion was similar among patients receiving remdesivir and those receiving placebo (appendix p 4). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 patients in the remdesivir group and 50 (64%) of 78 in the control group (table 4). The most common adverse events in the remdesivir group were constipation, hypoalbuminaemia, hypokalaemia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased total bilirubin; and in the placebo group, the most common were hypoalbuminaemia, constipation, anaemia, hypokalaemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased blood lipids, and increased total bilirubin. 28 (18%) serious adverse events were reported in the remdesivir group and 20 (26%) were reported in the control group. More patients in the remdesivir group than the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events or serious adverse events (18 [12%] in the remdesivir group vs four [5%] in the placebo group), among whom seven (5%) were due to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome in the remdesivir group.

COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. Our trial found that intravenous remdesivir did not significantly improve the time to clinical improvement, mortality, or time to clearance of virus in patients with serious COVID-19 compared with placebo. Compared with a previous study of compassionate use of remdesivir,21Grein J Ohmagari N Shin D et al.Compassionate use of remdesivir for patients with severe Covid-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online April 10.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007016Google Scholar our study population was less ill (eg, at the time of enrolment, 0·4% were on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation vs 64% in the previous study) and was treated somewhat earlier in their disease course (median 10 days vs 12 days). Such differences might be expected to favour remdesivir, providing greater effects in our study population, but our results did not meet this expectation. However, our study did not reach its target enrolment because the stringent public health measures used in Wuhan led to marked reductions in new patient presentations in mid-March, and restrictions on hospital bed availability resulted in most patients being enrolled later in the course of disease. Consequently, we could not adequately assess whether earlier remdesivir treatment might have provided clinical benefit. However, among patients who were treated within 10 days of symptom onset, remdesivir was not a significant factor but was associated with a numerical reduction of 5 days in median time to clinical improvement. Ongoing controlled clinical trials are expected to confirm or refute our findings. In one murine model of SARS, remdesivir treatment starting at 2 days after infection, after virus replication and lung airway epithelial damage had already peaked, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-1 lung titres but did not decrease disease severity or mortality.13Sheahan TP Sims AC Graham RL et al.Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses.Sci Transl Med. 2017; 9eaal3653Google Scholar A need for early treatment has been found in non-human primate models of SARS and MERS in which virus replication is very short-lived and lung pathology appears to develop more rapidly than in human infections.17de Wit E Feldmann F Cronin J et al.Prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir (GS-5734) treatment in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020; 117: 6771-6776Google Scholar,  19Williamson BN Feldmann F Schwarz B et al.Clinical benefit of remdesivir in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 22.)

Studies of higher-dose regimens for which there are safety data (eg, 150–200 mg daily doses) warrant consideration in severe COVID-19. Our study found that remdesivir was adequately tolerated and no new safety concerns were identified. The overall proportion of patients with serious adverse events tended to be lower in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients. However, a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients had dosing prematurely stopped by the investigators because of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, and vomiting), aminotransferase or bilirubin increases, and worsened cardiopulmonary status. Limitations of our study include insufficient power to detect assumed differences in clinical outcomes, initiation of treatment quite late in COVID-19, and the absence of data on infectious virus recovery or on possible emergence of reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. Of note, in non-human primates, the inhibitory effects of remdesivir on infectious SARS-CoV-2 recovery in bronchoalveolar lavages were much greater than in controls, but viral RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were not consistently decreased versus controls.19Williamson BN Feldmann F Schwarz B et al.Clinical benefit of remdesivir in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 22.)

Furthermore, we have no answer to whether longer treatment course and higher dose of remdesivir would be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19. In summary, we found that this dose regimen of intravenous remdesivir was adequately tolerated but did not provide significant clinical or antiviral effects in seriously ill patients with COVID-19. However, we could not exclude clinically meaningful differences and saw numerical reductions in some clinical parameters. Ongoing studies with larger sample sizes will continue to inform our understanding of the effect of remdesivir on COVID-19. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the antiviral potency of remdesivir (eg, higher-dose regimens, combination with other antivirals, or SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies) and to mitigate immunopathological host responses contributing to COVID-19 severity (eg, inhibitors of IL-6, IL-1, or TNFα) require rigorous study in patients with severe COVID-19.

DOI:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31095-3,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31095-3,Editorial,COVID-19 in Brazil: “So what?”," The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reached Latin America later than other continents. The first case recorded in Brazil was on Feb 25, 2020. But now, Brazil has the most cases and deaths in Latin America (105 222 cases and 7288 deaths as of May 4), and these are probably substantial underestimates. Even more worryingly, the doubling of the rate of deaths is estimated at only 5 days and a recent study by Imperial College (London, UK), which analysed the active transmission rate of COVID-19 in 48 countries, showed that Brazil is the country with the highest rate of transmission (R0 of 2·81). Large cities such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the main hotspots now but there are concerns and early signs that infections are moving inland into smaller cities with inadequate provisions of intensive care beds and ventilators. Yet, perhaps the biggest threat to Brazil's COVID-19 response is its president, Jair Bolsonaro. When asked by journalists last week about the rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, he responded: “So what? What do you want me to do?” He not only continues to sow confusion by openly flouting and discouraging the sensible measures of physical distancing and lockdown brought in by state governors and city mayors but has also lost two important and influential ministers in the past 3 weeks. First, on April 16, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the respected and well liked Health Minister, was sacked after a television interview, in which he strongly criticised Bolsonaro's actions and called for unity, or else risk leaving the 210 million Brazilians utterly confused. Then on April 24, following the removal of the head of Brazil's federal police by Bolsonaro, Justice Minister Sérgio Moro, one of the most powerful figures of the right-wing government and appointed by Bolsonaro to combat corruption, announced his resignation. Such disarray at the heart of the administration is a deadly distraction in the middle of a public health emergency and is also a stark sign that Brazil's leadership has lost its moral compass, if it ever had one. Even without the vacuum of political actions at federal level, Brazil would have a difficult time to combat COVID-19. About 13 million Brazilians live in favelas, often with more than three people per room and little access to clean water. Physical distancing and hygiene recommendations are near impossible to follow in these environments—many favelas have organised themselves to implement measures as best as possible. Brazil has a large informal employment sector with many sources of income no longer an option. The Indigenous population has been under severe threat even before the COVID-19 outbreak because the government has been ignoring or even encouraging illegal mining and logging in the Amazon rainforest. These loggers and miners now risk bringing COVID-19 to remote populations. An open letter on May 3 by a global coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists, and intellectuals, organised by the Brazilian photojournalist Sebastião Salgado, warns of an impending genocide. What are the health and science community and civil society doing in a country known for its activism and outspoken opposition to injustice and inequity and with health as a constitutional right? Many scientific organisations, such as the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and ABRASCO, have long-opposed Bolsonaro because of severe cuts in the science budget and a more general demolition of social security and public services. In the context of COVID-19, many organisations have launched manifestos aimed at the public—such as Pact for Life and Brazil—and written statements and pleas to government officials calling for unity and joined up solutions. Pot-banging from balconies as protest during presidential announcements happens frequently. There is much research going on, from basic science to epidemiology, and there is rapid production of personal protective equipment, respirators, and testing kits. These are hopeful actions. Yet, leadership at the highest level of government is crucial in quickly averting the worst outcome of this pandemic, as is evident from other countries. In our 2009 Brazil Series, the authors concluded: “The challenge is ultimately political, requiring continuous engagement by Brazilian society as a whole to secure the right to health for all Brazilian people.” Brazil as a country must come together to give a clear answer to the “So what?” by its President.

The mechanisms underlying the disproportionate effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, however, remain incompletely understood.1Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062Google Scholar,  2Horton R Offline: COVID-19—bewilderment and candour.Lancet. 2020; 3951178Google Scholar SARS-CoV-2 infects the host using the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in several organs, including the lung, heart, kidney, and intestine.

Patient 1 was a male renal transplant recipient, aged 71 years, with coronary artery disease and arterial hypertension. The patient's condition deteriorated following COVID-19 diagnosis, and he required mechanical ventilation. Multisystem organ failure occurred, and the patient died on day 8. Post-mortem analysis of the transplanted kidney by electron microscopy revealed viral inclusion structures in endothelial cells (figure A, B). In histological analyses, we found an accumulation of inflammatory cells associated with endothelium, as well as apoptotic bodies, in the heart, the small bowel (figure C) and lung (figure D). An accumulation of mononuclear cells was found in the lung, and most small lung vessels appeared congested.FigurePathology of endothelial cell dysfunction in COVID-19Show full caption(A, B) Electron microscopy of kidney tissue shows viral inclusion bodies in a peritubular space and viral particles in endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary loops.

COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. Patient 2 was a woman, aged 58 years, with diabetes, arterial hypertension, and obesity. She developed progressive respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and subsequently developed multi-organ failure and needed renal replacement therapy. On day 16, mesenteric ischaemia prompted removal of necrotic small intestine. Circulatory failure occurred in the setting of right heart failure consequent to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest resulted in death. Post-mortem histology revealed lymphocytic endotheliitis in lung, heart, kidney, and liver as well as liver cell necrosis. We found histological evidence of myocardial infarction but no sign of lymphocytic myocarditis. Histology of the small intestine showed endotheliitis (endothelialitis) of the submucosal vessels. Patient 3 was a man, aged 69 years, with hypertension who developed respiratory failure as a result of COVID-19 and required mechanical ventilation. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Circulatory collapse ensued with mesenteric ischaemia, and small intestine resection was performed, but the patient survived. Histology of the small intestine resection revealed prominent endotheliitis of the submucosal vessels and apoptotic bodies (figure C). We found evidence of direct viral infection of the endothelial cell and diffuse endothelial inflammation. Although the virus uses ACE2 receptor expressed by pneumocytes in the epithelial alveolar lining to infect the host, thereby causing lung injury, the ACE2 receptor is also widely expressed on endothelial cells, which traverse multiple organs.3Ferrario CM Jessup J Chappell MC et al.Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockers on cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.Circulation. 2005; 111: 2605-2610Google Scholar Recruitment of immune cells, either by direct viral infection of the endothelium or immune-mediated, can result in widespread endothelial dysfunction associated with apoptosis (figure D). The vascular endothelium is an active paracrine, endocrine, and autocrine organ that is indispensable for the regulation of vascular tone and the maintenance of vascular homoeostasis.5Flammer AJ Anderson T Celermajer DS et al.The assessment of endothelial function: from research into clinical practice.Circulation. 2012; 126: 753-767Google Scholar Endothelial dysfunction is a principal determinant of microvascular dysfunction by shifting the vascular equilibrium towards more vasoconstriction with subsequent organ ischaemia, inflammation with associated tissue oedema, and a pro-coagulant state.6Bonetti PO Lerman LO Lerman A Endothelial dysfunction - a marker of atherosclerotic risk.Arterioscl Throm Vas. 2003; 23: 168-175Google Scholar Our findings show the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and an accumulation of inflammatory cells, with evidence of endothelial and inflammatory cell death. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates the induction of endotheliitis in several organs as a direct consequence of viral involvement (as noted with presence of viral bodies) and of the host inflammatory response. In addition, induction of apoptosis and pyroptosis might have an important role in endothelial cell injury in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-endotheliitis could explain the systemic impaired microcirculatory function in different vascular beds and their clinical sequelae in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis provides a rationale for therapies to stabilise the endothelium while tackling viral replication, particularly with anti-inflammatory anti-cytokine drugs, ACE inhibitors, and statins.7Anderson TJ Meredith IT Yeung AC Frei B Selwyn AP Ganz P The effect of cholesterol-lowering and antioxidant therapy on endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion.N Engl J Med. 1995; 332: 488-493Google Scholar,  8Taddei S Virdis A Ghiadoni L Mattei P Salvetti A Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in essential hypertensive patients.J Hypertens. 1998; 16: 447-456Google Scholar,  9Flammer AJ Sudano I Hermann F et al.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves vascular function in rheumatoid arthritis.Circulation. 2008; 117: 2262-2269Google Scholar,  10Hurlimann D Forster A Noll G et al.Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment improves endothelial function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Circulation. 2002; 106: 2184-2187Google Scholar,  11Feldmann M Maini RN Woody JN et al.Trials of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy for COVID-19 are urgently needed.Lancet. 2020;  (published online April 9.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30858-8SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFGoogle Scholar This strategy could be particularly relevant for vulnerable patients with pre-existing endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and established cardiovascular disease, all of which are associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19.

Following the pneumonia cases of unknown cause reported in Wuhan and considering the shared history of exposure to Huanan seafood market across the patients, an epidemiological alert was released by the local health authority on Dec 31, 2019, and the market was shut down on Jan 1, 2020. Meanwhile, 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were transferred to a designated hospital starting from Dec 31, 2019. An expert team of physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, and government officials was soon formed after the alert. Since the cause was unknown at the onset of these emerging infections, the diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan was based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia. Suspected patients were isolated using airborne precautions in the designated hospital, Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China), and fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures were taken. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Local centres for disease control and prevention collected respiratory, blood, and faeces specimens, then shipped them to designated authoritative laboratories to detect the pathogen (NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Mérieux Laboratory, Beijing, China). A novel coronavirus, which was named 2019-nCoV, was isolated then from lower respiratory tract specimen and a diagnostic test for this virus was developed soon after that.14Tan W Zhao X Ma X et al.A novel coronavirus genome identified in a cluster of pneumonia cases — Wuhan, China 2019−2020.http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/a3907201-f64f-4154-a19e-4253b453d10cDate accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Of 59 suspected cases, 41 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV.

Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, or bronchial aspirates were tested for common viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed. Given the emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases during the influenza season, antibiotics (orally and intravenously) and oseltamivir (orally 75 mg twice daily) were empirically administered. Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 40–120 mg per day) was given as a combined regimen if severe community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed by physicians at the designated hospital. Oxygen support (eg, nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) was administered to patients according to the severity of hypoxaemia. Repeated tests for 2019-nCoV were done in patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection to show viral clearance before hospital discharge or discontinuation of isolation. We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays for all patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection who were reported by the local health authority. The admission data of these patients was from Dec 16, 2019, to Jan 2, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardised data collection forms (modified case record form for severe acute respiratory infection clinical characterisation shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) from electronic medical records. Two researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected. To ascertain the epidemiological and symptom data, which were not available from electronic medical records, the researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. To characterise the effect of coronavirus on the production of cytokines or chemokines in the acute phase of the illness, plasma cytokines and chemokines (IL1B, IL1RA, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8 (also known as CXCL8), IL9, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL15, IL17A, Eotaxin (also known as CCL11), basic FGF2, GCSF (CSF3), GMCSF (CSF2), IFNγ, IP10 (CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2), MIP1A (CCL3), MIP1B (CCL4), PDGFB, RANTES (CCL5), TNFα, and VEGFA were measured using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma samples from four healthy adults were used as controls for cross-comparison. The median time from being transferred to a designated hospital to the blood sample collection was 4 days (IQR 2–5). Each 80 μL plasma sample from the patients and contacts was added into 240 μL of Trizol LS (10296028; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 μL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 μL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final reaction mix concentration of the primers was 500 nM and probe was 200 nM. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: 50°C for 15 min and 95°C for 3 min, 50 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 45 s. Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead. RNAaemia was defined as a positive result for real-time RT-PCR in the plasma sample. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock were defined according to the interim guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus.9WHONovel coronavirus – China.http://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/Date: Jan 12, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) of less than 300 mm Hg.15Sanz F Gimeno C Lloret T et al.Relationship between the presence of hypoxemia and the inflammatory response measured by C-reactive protein in bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia.Eur Respir J. 2011; 38: 2492Google Scholar Acute kidney injury was identified and classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification.16Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) acute kidney injury work groupKDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury.https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guideline-English.pdfDate: March, 2012Date accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Secondary infection was diagnosed if the patients had clinical symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteraemia, and was combined with a positive culture of a new pathogen from a lower respiratory tract specimen (including the sputum, transtracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or from blood samples taken ≥48 h after admission).17Garner JS Jarvis WR Emori TG Horan TC Hughes JM CDC definitions for nosocomial infections, 1988.Am J Infect Control. 1988; 16: 128-140SummaryFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (4796)Google Scholar Cardiac injury followed the definition used in our previous study in H7N9 patients.18Gao C Wang Y Gu X et al.Association between cardiac injury and mortality in hospitalized patients infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus.Crit Care Med. 2020;  (published online Jan 20)DOI:10.1097/CCM.0000000000004207CrossrefScopus (1)Google Scholar In brief, cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.

By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan. 20 [49%]) of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients were aged 25–49 years, and 14 (34%) were aged 50–64 years (figure 1A). The median age of the patients was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0; table 1). In our cohort of the first 41 patients as of Jan 2, no children or adolescents were infected. Of the 41 patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to the ICU because they required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxaemia. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%]); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).Figure 1Date of illness onset and age distribution of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infectionShow full caption(A) Number of hospital admissions by age group.

ICU=intensive care unit. 27 (66%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market (figure 1B). Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care (nine [69%]) and those with non-ICU care (18 [64%]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The first fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38; table 1). More than half of patients (22 [55%] of 40) developed dyspnoea. The median duration from illness onset to dyspnoea was 8·0 days (IQR 5·0–13·0). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7·0 days (4·0–8·0), to shortness of breath was 8·0 days (5·0–13·0), to ARDS was 9·0 days (8·0–14·0), to mechanical ventilation was 10·5 days (7·0–14·0), and to ICU admission was 10·5 days (8·0–17·0; figure 2).Figure 2Timeline of 2019-nCoV cases after onset of illnessView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) The blood counts of patients on admission showed leucopenia (white blood cell count less than 4 × 109/L; ten [25%] of 40 patients) and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1·0 × 109/L; 26 [63%] patients; table 2). Prothrombin time and D-dimer level on admission were higher in ICU patients (median prothrombin time 12·2 s [IQR 11·2–13·4]; median D-dimer level 2·4 mg/L [0·6–14·4]) than non-ICU patients (median prothrombin time 10·7 s [9·8–12·1], p=0·012; median D-dimer level 0·5 mg/L [0·3–0·8], p=0·0042). Levels of aspartate aminotransferase were increased in 15 (37%) of 41 patients, including eight (62%) of 13 ICU patients and seven (25%) of 28 non-ICU patients. Hypersensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) was increased substantially in five patients, in whom the diagnosis of virus-related cardiac injury was made.Table 2Laboratory findings of patients infected with 2019-nCoV on admission to hospitalAll patients (n=41)ICU care (n=13)No ICU care (n=28)p valueWhite blood cell count, × 109/L6·2 (4·1–10·5)11·3 (5·8–12·1)5·7 (3·1–7·6)0·011<410/40 (25%)1/13 (8%)9/27 (33%)0·0414–1018/40 (45%)5/13 (38%)13/27 (48%)..>1012/40 (30%)7/13 (54%)5/27 (19%)..Neutrophil count, × 109/L5·0 (3·3–8·9)10·6 (5·0–11·8)4·4 (2·0–6·1)0·00069Lymphocyte count, × 109/L0·8 (0·6–1·1)0·4 (0·2–0·8)1·0 (0·7–1·1)0·0041<1·026/41 (63%)11/13 (85%)15/28 (54%)0·045≥1·015/41 (37%)2/13 (15%)13/28 (46%)..Haemoglobin, g/L126·0 (118·0–140·0)122·0 (111·0–128·0)130·5 (120·0–140·0)0·20Platelet count, × 109/L164·5 (131·5–263·0)196·0 (165·0–263·0)149·0 (131·0–263·0)0·45<1002/40 (5%)1/13 (8%)1/27 (4%)0·45≥10038/40 (95%)12/13 (92%)26/27 (96%)..Prothrombin time, s11·1 (10·1–12·4)12·2 (11·2–13·4)10·7 (9·8–12·1)0·012Activated partial thromboplastin time, s27·0 (24·2–34·1)26·2 (22·5–33·9)27·7 (24·8–34·1)0·57D-dimer, mg/L0·5 (0·3–1·3)2·4 (0·6–14·4)0·5 (0·3–0·8)0·0042Albumin, g/L31·4 (28·9–36·0)27·9 (26·3–30·9)34·7 (30·2–36·5)0·00066Alanine aminotransferase, U/L32·0 (21·0–50·0)49·0 (29·0–115·0)27·0 (19·5–40·0)0·038Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L34·0 (26·0–48·0)44·0 (30·0–70·0)34·0 (24·0–40·5)0·10≤4026/41 (63%)5/13 (38%)21/28 (75%)0·025>4015/41 (37%)8/13 (62%)7/28 (25%)..Total bilirubin, mmol/L11·7 (9·5–13·9)14·0 (11·9–32·9)10·8 (9·4–12·3)0·011Potassium, mmol/L4·2 (3·8–4·8)4·6 (4·0–5·0)4·1 (3·8–4·6)0·27Sodium, mmol/L139·0 (137·0–140·0)138·0 (137·0–139·0)139·0 (137·5–140·5)0·26Creatinine, μmol/L74·2 (57·5–85·7)79·0 (53·1–92·7)73·3 (57·5–84·7)0·84≤13337/41 (90%)11/13 (85%)26/28 (93%)0·42>1334/41 (10%)2/13 (15%)2/28 (7%)..Creatine kinase, U/L132·5 (62·0–219·0)132·0 (82·0–493·0)133·0 (61·0–189·0)0·31≤18527/40 (68%)7/13 (54%)20/27 (74%)0·21>18513/40 (33%)6/13 (46%)7/27 (26%)..Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L286·0 (242·0–408·0)400·0 (323·0–578·0)281·0 (233·0–357·0)0·0044≤24511/40 (28%)1/13 (8%)10/27 (37%)0·036>24529/40 (73%)12/13 (92%)17/27 (63%)..Hypersensitive troponin I, pg/mL3·4 (1·1–9·1)3·3 (3·0–163·0)3·5 (0·7–5·4)0·075>28 (99th percentile)5/41 (12%)4/13 (31%)1/28 (4%)0·017Procalcitonin, ng/mL0·1 (0·1–0·1)0·1 (0·1–0·4)0·1 (0·1–0·1)0·031<0·127/39 (69%)6/12 (50%)21/27 (78%)0·029≥0·1 to <0·257/39 (18%)3/12 (25%)4/27 (15%)..≥0·25 to <0·52/39 (5%)0/122/27 (7%)..≥0·53/39 (8%)3/12 (25%)** Complicated typical secondary infection during the first hospitalisation.0/27..Bilateral involvement of chest radiographs40/41 (98%)13/13 (100%)27/28 (96%)0·68Cycle threshold of respiratory tract32·2 (31·0–34·5)31·1 (30·0–33·5)32·2 (31·1–34·7)0·39Data are median (IQR) or n/N (%), where N is the total number of patients with available data. p values comparing ICU care and no ICU care are from χ2, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test. 2019-nCoV=2019 novel coronavirus.

Three of the four patients with secondary infection had procalcitonin greater than 0·5 ng/mL (0·69 ng/mL, 1·46 ng/mL, and 6·48 ng/mL). On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. Of the 41 patients, 40 (98%) had bilateral involvement (table 2). The typical findings of chest CT images of ICU patients on admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3A). The representative chest CT findings of non-ICU patients showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3B). Later chest CT images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, whereas the consolidation had been resolved (figure 3C).Figure 3Chest CT imagesShow full caption(A) Transverse chest CT images from a 40-year-old man showing bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation on day 15 after symptom onset.

Initial plasma IL1B, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNFα, and VEGF concentrations were higher in both ICU patients and non-ICU patients than in healthy adults (appendix pp 6–7). Plasma levels of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between healthy adults and patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Further comparison between ICU and non-ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα were higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients. All patients had pneumonia. Common complications included ARDS (12 [29%] of 41 patients), followed by RNAaemia (six [15%] patients), acute cardiac injury (five [12%] patients), and secondary infection (four [10%] patients; table 3). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in four (10%) patients, with two of them (5%) had refractory hypoxaemia and received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as salvage therapy. All patients were administered with empirical antibiotic treatment, and 38 (93%) patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir). Additionally, nine (22%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. A comparison of clinical features between patients who received and did not receive systematic corticosteroids is in the appendix (pp 1–5).Table 3Treatments and outcomes of patients infected with 2019-nCoVAll patients (n=41)ICU care (n=13)No ICU care (n=28)p valueDuration from illness onset to first admission7·0 (4·0–8·0)7·0 (4·0–8·0)7·0 (4·0–8·5)0·87ComplicationsAcute respiratory distress syndrome12 (29%)11 (85%)1 (4%)<0·0001RNAaemia6 (15%)2 (15%)4 (14%)0·93Cycle threshold of RNAaemia35·1 (34·7–35·1)35·1 (35·1–35·1)34·8 (34·1–35·4)0·35Acute cardiac injury** Defined as blood levels of hypersensitive troponin I above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/mL) or new abnormalities shown on electrocardiography and echocardiography.5 (12%)4 (31%)1 (4%)0·017Acute kidney injury3 (7%)3 (23%)00·027Secondary infection4 (10%)4 (31%)00·0014Shock3 (7%)3 (23%)00·027TreatmentAntiviral therapy38 (93%)12 (92%)26 (93%)0·46Antibiotic therapy41 (100%)13 (100%)28 (100%)NAUse of corticosteroid9 (22%)6 (46%)3 (11%)0·013Continuous renal replacement therapy3 (7%)3 (23%)00·027Oxygen support......<0·0001Nasal cannula27 (66%)1 (8%)26 (93%)..Non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula10 (24%)8 (62%)2 (7%)..Invasive mechanical ventilation2 (5%)2 (15%)0..Invasive mechanical ventilation and ECMO2 (5%)2 (15%)0..Prognosis......0·014Hospitalisation7 (17%)1 (8%)6 (21%)..Discharge28 (68%)7 (54%)21 (75%)..Death6 (15%)5 (38%)1 (4%)..Data are median (IQR) or n (%). p values are comparing ICU care and no ICU care. 2019-nCoV=2019 novel coronavirus.

Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least 10 days, with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from upper respiratory tract. We report here a cohort of 41 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Patients had serious, sometimes fatal, pneumonia and were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan, China, by Jan 2, 2020. Clinical presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. The time between hospital admission and ARDS was as short as 2 days. At this stage, the mortality rate is high for 2019-nCoV, because six (15%) of 41 patients in this cohort died. The number of deaths is rising quickly. As of Jan 24, 2020, 835 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections were reported in China, with 25 fatal cases. Reports have been released of exported cases in many provinces in China, and in other countries; some health-care workers have also been infected in Wuhan. Taken together, evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019-nCoV. We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission.19Perlman S Netland J Coronaviruses post-SARS: update on replication and pathogenesis.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009; 7: 439-450CrossrefPubMedScopus (306)Google Scholar Airborne precautions, such as a fit-tested N95 respirator, and other personal protective equipment are strongly recommended. To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored among health-care workers. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymptomatic infections. Similarities of clinical features between 2019-nCoV and previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans. These features of 2019-nCoV infection bear some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.20Lee N Hui D Wu A et al.A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.N Engl J Med. 2003; 348: 1986-1994CrossrefPubMedScopus (1249)Google Scholar,  21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (409)Google Scholar However, few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway. Furthermore, 2019-nCoV patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhoea), whereas about 20–25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhoea.21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (409)Google Scholar Faecal and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage. The pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum (eg, IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1) were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103CrossrefPubMedScopus (220)Google Scholar MERS-CoV infection was also reported to induce increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL15, and IL17).23Mahallawi WH Khabour OF Zhang Q Makhdoum HM Suliman BA MERS-CoV infection in humans is associated with a pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokine profile.Cytokine. 2018; 104: 8-13CrossrefPubMedScopus (13)Google Scholar We noted that patients infected with 2019-nCoV also had high amounts of IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity. However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103CrossrefPubMedScopus (220)Google Scholar Further studies are necessary to characterise the Th1 and Th2 responses in 2019-nCoV infection and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Autopsy or biopsy studies would be the key to understand the disease. In view of the high amount of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV,22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103CrossrefPubMedScopus (220)Google Scholar,  24He L Ding Y Zhang Q et al.Expression of elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in SARS-CoV-infected ACE2+ cells in SARS patients: relation to the acute lung injury and pathogenesis of SARS.J Pathol. 2006; 210: 288-297CrossrefPubMedScopus (50)Google Scholar MERS-CoV,25Faure E Poissy J Goffard A et al.Distinct immune response in two MERS-CoV-infected patients: can we go from bench to bedside?.PLoS One. 2014; 9e88716CrossrefPubMedScopus (58)Google Scholar,  26Falzarano D de Wit E Rasmussen AL et al.Treatment with interferon-α2b and ribavirin improves outcome in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques.Nat Med. 2013; 19: 1313-1317CrossrefPubMedScopus (177)Google Scholar and 2019-nCoV infections, corticosteroids were used frequently for treatment of patients with severe illness, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury. However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance.27Stockman LJ Bellamy R Garner P SARS: systematic review of treatment effects.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e343CrossrefPubMedScopus (193)Google Scholar,  28Lansbury L Rodrigo C Leonardi-Bee J Nguyen-Van-Tam J Lim WS Corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019; 2: CD010406PubMedGoogle Scholar,  29Arabi YM Mandourah Y Al-Hameed F et al.Corticosteroid therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome.Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2018; 197: 757-767CrossrefPubMedScopus (51)Google Scholar Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance.30WHOClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.https://www.who.int/internal-publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspectedDate: Jan 11, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Among our cohort of 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection, corticosteroids were given to very few non-ICU cases, and low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids were given to less than half of severely ill patients with ARDS. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients infected with 2019-nCoV. No antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. In a historical control study,31Chu CM Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256CrossrefPubMedScopus (222)Google Scholar the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes). Arabi and colleagues initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection in Saudi Arabia.32Arabi YM Alothman A Balkhy HH et al.Treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome with a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-β1b (MIRACLE trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.Trials. 2018; 19: 81CrossrefPubMedScopus (30)Google Scholar Preclinical evidence showed the potent efficacy of remdesivir (a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug) to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections.33Sheahan TP Sims AC Graham RL et al.Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses.Sci Transl Med. 2017; 9eaal3653CrossrefPubMedScopus (75)Google Scholar,  34Sheahan TP Sims AC Leist SR et al.Comparative therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir and combination lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 222CrossrefPubMedScopus (62)Google Scholar As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus. Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection. Our study has some limitations. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariable-adjusted methods. This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity. At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively.35Cui J Li F Shi Z-L Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2019; 17: 181-192CrossrefPubMedScopus (113)Google Scholar Extensive research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has driven the discovery of many SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses in bats.

Reliable quick pathogen tests and feasible differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians in their first contact with suspected patients. Because of the pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaption, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.

Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.

Quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease to ascertain if they become unwell, so reducing the risk of them infecting others.1Centers for Disease Control and PreventionQuarantine and isolation.https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.htmlDate: 2017Google Scholar This definition differs from isolation, which is the separation of people who have been diagnosed with a contagious disease from people who are not sick; however, the two terms are often used interchangeably, especially in communication with the public.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar The word quarantine was first used in Venice, Italy in 1127 with regards to leprosy and was widely used in response to the Black Death, although it was not until 300 years later that the UK properly began to impose quarantine in response to plague.3Newman K Shutt up: bubonic plague and quarantine in early modern England.J Sol Hist. 2012; 45: 809-834CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Most recently, quarantine has been used in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This outbreak has seen entire cities in China effectively placed under mass quarantine, while many thousands of foreign nationals returning home from China have been asked to self-isolate at home or in state-run facilities.4Public Health EnglandNovel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – what you need to know.https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2020/01/23/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-what-you-need-to-know/Date: 2020Google Scholar There are precedents for such measures. Citywide quarantines were also imposed in areas of China and Canada during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whereas entire villages in many west African countries were quarantined during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

Two studies reported on longer-term effects of quarantine. 3 years after the SARS outbreak, alcohol abuse or dependency symptoms were positively associated with having been quarantined in health-care workers.32Wu P Liu X Fang Y et al.Alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms among hospital employees exposed to a SARS outbreak.Alcohol Alcohol. 2008; 43: 706-712CrossrefPubMedScopus (9)Google Scholar In a multivariate analysis,32Wu P Liu X Fang Y et al.Alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms among hospital employees exposed to a SARS outbreak.Alcohol Alcohol. 2008; 43: 706-712CrossrefPubMedScopus (9)Google Scholar after controlling for demographic factors, having been quarantined and having worked in a high-risk location were the two types of exposure significantly associated with these outcomes (for quarantine: unadjusted mean ratio 0·45; 95% CI 1·02–2·65). After quarantine, many participants continued to engage in avoidance behaviours. For health-care workers,20Marjanovic Z Greenglass ER Coffey S The relevance of psychosocial variables and working conditions in predicting nurses' coping strategies during the SARS crisis: an online questionnaire survey.Int J Nurs Stud. 2007; 44: 991-998CrossrefPubMedScopus (17)Google Scholar being quarantined was significantly and positively associated with avoidance behaviours, such as minimising direct contact with patients and not reporting to work.

There was mixed evidence for whether participant characteristics and demographics were predictors of the psychological impact of quarantine. A study28Taylor MR Agho KE Stevens GJ Raphael B Factors influencing psychological distress during a disease epidemic: data from Australia's first outbreak of equine influenza.BMC Public Health. 2008; 8: 347CrossrefPubMedScopus (27)Google Scholar of horse owners quarantined because of equine influenza identified several characteristics associated with negative psychological impacts: younger age (16–24 years), lower levels of formal educational qualifications, female gender, and having one child as opposed to no children (although having three or more children appeared somewhat protective). However, another study16Hawryluck L Gold WL Robinson S Pogorski S Galea S Styra R SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 1206-1212CrossrefPubMedScopus (93)Google Scholar suggested that demographic factors such as marital status, age, education, living with other adults, and having children were not associated with psychological outcomes. Having a history of psychiatric illness was associated with experiencing anxiety and anger 4–6 months after release from quarantine.17Jeong H Yim HW Song Y-J et al.Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East respiratory syndrome.Epidemiol Health. 2016; 38: e2016048CrossrefPubMedScopus (12)Google Scholar Health-care workers25Reynolds DL Garay JR Deamond SL Moran MK Gold W Styra R Understanding, compliance and psychological impact of the SARS quarantine experience.Epidemiol Infect. 2008; 136: 997-1007CrossrefPubMedScopus (18)Google Scholar who had been quarantined had more severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress than members of the general public who had been quarantined, scoring significantly higher on all dimensions. Health-care workers also felt greater stigmatisation than the general public, exhibited more avoidance behaviours after quarantine, reported greater lost income, and were consistently more affected psychologically: they reported substantially more anger, annoyance, fear, frustration, guilt, helplessness, isolation, loneliness, nervousness, sadness, worry, and were less happy. Health-care workers were also substantially more likely to think they had SARS and to be concerned about infecting others.

This finding is probably linked to economic effects but could also be related to disruption of social networks and loss of leisure activities. Notably, this study is exceptional in that occupation and exposure are confounded. A study14Desclaux A Badji D Ndione AG Sow K Accepted monitoring or endured quarantine? Ebola contacts' perceptions in Senegal.Soc Sci Med. 2017; 178: 38-45CrossrefPubMedScopus (5)Google Scholar of people quarantined because of potential Ebola contact found that, although participants received financial assistance, some felt that the amount was insufficient and that it came too late; many felt wronged as the assistance they received did not cover their ongoing professional expenses. Many became dependent on their families to provide for them financially during quarantine which was often hard to accept and could cause conflicts. In one study,13Cava MA Fay KE Beanlands HJ McCay EA Wignall R The experience of quarantine for individuals affected by SARS in Toronto.Public Health Nurs. 2005; 22: 398-406CrossrefPubMedScopus (18)Google Scholar none of those quarantined in Toronto during SARS reported much financial hardship because employers or the government compensated them, but where that reimbursement was slow to arrive it caused those less financially well-off to struggle. Potentially related to financial loss, participants with a combined annual household income of less than CAN$40 000 showed significantly higher amounts of post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms.16Hawryluck L Gold WL Robinson S Pogorski S Galea S Styra R SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 1206-1212CrossrefPubMedScopus (93)Google Scholar These symptoms are probably because those with lower incomes were more likely to be affected by the temporary loss of income than those with higher incomes. People who are quarantined and have lower household incomes might require additional levels of support, along with those who lose earnings while in quarantine (ie, self-employed people who are unable to work or salaried staff who are unable to take paid leave). Financial reimbursements should be provided where possible and programmes developed to provide financial support throughout the quarantine period. Where appropriate, employers might also wish to consider proactive approaches that allow employees to work from home if they wish to, both to avoid financial loss and to stave off boredom, while being mindful that staff in these situations might not be at their most productive and might benefit more from remote social support from their colleagues.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Stigma from others was a major theme throughout the literature, often continuing for some time after quarantine, even after containment of the outbreak.

Those quarantined during the Ebola epidemic in Liberia reported that stigma could lead to disenfranchisement of minority groups in the community as families under quarantine were often said to belong to different ethnic groups, tribes, or religions and were perceived as dangerous because they were different.24Pellecchia U Crestani R Decroo T Van den Bergh R Al-Kourdi Y Social consequences of Ebola containment measures in Liberia.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0143036CrossrefPubMedScopus (23)Google Scholar Perhaps because of this stigma, being quarantined led participants in this study to keep easily treatable, non-Ebola illnesses a secret and avoided seeking help. General education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can be beneficial to reduce stigmatisation, whereas more detailed information targeted at schools and workplaces might also be useful. It might also be that media reporting contributes to stigmatising attitudes in the general public; the media is a powerful influence on public attitudes and dramatic headlines and fear mongering have been shown to contribute to stigmatising attitudes in the past (eg, during the SARS outbreak).36Person B Sy F Holton K et al.Fear and stigma: the epidemic within the SARS outbreak.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 358-363CrossrefPubMedScopus (70)Google Scholar This issue highlights the need for public health officials to provide rapid, clear messages delivered effectively for the entire affected population to promote accurate understanding of the situation. During major infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be a necessary preventive measure. However, this Review suggests that quarantine is often associated with a negative psychological effect. During the period of quarantine this negative psychological effect is unsurprising, yet the evidence that a psychological effect of quarantine can still be detected months or years later—albeit from a small number of studies17Jeong H Yim HW Song Y-J et al.Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East respiratory syndrome.Epidemiol Health. 2016; 38: e2016048CrossrefPubMedScopus (12)Google Scholar,  19Liu X Kakade M Fuller CJ et al.Depression after exposure to stressful events: lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic.Compr Psychiatry. 2012; 53: 15-23CrossrefPubMedScopus (6)Google Scholar— is more troubling and suggests the need to ensure that effective mitigation measures are put in place as part of the quarantine planning process. In this regard, our results do not provide strong evidence that any particular demographic factors are risk factors of poor psychological outcomes after quarantine and therefore require specific attention. However, history of mental illness was only examined as a risk factor by one study. Previous literature suggests that psychiatric history is associated with psychological distress after experiencing any disaster-related trauma37Alvarez J Hunt M Risk and resilience in canine search and rescue handlers after 9/11.J Trauma Stress. 2005; 18: 497-505CrossrefPubMedScopus (40)Google Scholar,  38Cukor J Wyka K Jayasinghe N et al.Prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms in utility workers deployed to the World Trade Center following the attacks of September 11, 2001.Depress Anxiety. 2011; 28: 210-217CrossrefPubMedScopus (34)Google Scholar and it is likely that people with pre-existing poor mental health would need extra support during quarantine. There also appeared to be a high prevalence of psychological distress in quarantined health-care workers, although there was mixed evidence as to whether this group were at higher risk for distress than non-health-care workers who were quarantined. For health-care workers, support from managers is essential in facilitating their return to work39Brooks SK Dunn R Amlôt R Rubin GJ Greenberg N A systematic, thematic review of social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in healthcare employees during an infectious disease outbreak.J Occup Environ Med. 2018; 60: 248-257CrossrefPubMedScopus (3)Google Scholar and managers should be aware of the potential risks for their staff who were quarantined so that they can prepare for early intervention. Longer quarantine is associated with poorer psychological outcomes, perhaps unsurprisingly, as it stands to reason that the stressors reported by participants could have more of an effect the longer they were experienced for. Restricting the length of quarantine to what is scientifically reasonable given the known duration of incubation periods, and not adopting an overly precautionary approach to this, would minimise the effect on people. Evidence from elsewhere also emphasises the importance of authorities adhering to their own recommended length of quarantine, and not extending it. For people already in quarantine, an extension, no matter how small, is likely to exacerbate any sense of frustration or demoralisation.40Rona RJ Fear NT Hull L et al.Mental health consequences of overstretch in the UK armed forces: first phase of a cohort study.BMJ. 2007; 335: 603CrossrefPubMedScopus (100)Google Scholar Imposing a cordon indefinitely on whole cities with no clear time limit (such as has been seen in Wuhan, China) might be more detrimental than strictly applied quarantine procedures limited to the period of incubation. People who are quarantined often feared being infected or infecting others. They also often have catastrophic appraisals of any physical symptoms experienced during the quarantine period. This fear is a common occurrence for people exposed to a worrying infectious disease,41Rubin GJ Harper S Williams PD et al.How to support staff deploying on overseas humanitarian work: a qualitative analysis of responder views about the 2014/15 West African Ebola outbreak.Eur J Psychotraumatol. 2016; 7: 30933CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar and might be exacerbated by the often inadequate information participants reported receiving from public health officials leaving them unclear of the nature of the risks they faced and why they were being quarantined at all. Ensuring that those under quarantine have a good understanding of the disease in question, and the reasons for quarantine, should be a priority. Officials also need to ensure that quarantined households have enough supplies for their basic needs and, importantly, these must be provided as rapidly as possible. Coordination for provision of supplies should ideally occur in advance, with conservation and reallocation plans established to ensure resources do not run out, which unfortunately has been reported.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Boredom and isolation will cause distress; people who are quarantined should be advised about what they can do to stave off boredom and provided with practical advice on coping and stress management techniques. Having a working mobile phone is now a necessity, not a luxury, and those stepping off a long flight to enter quarantine will probably welcome a charger or adaptor more than anything else.17Jeong H Yim HW Song Y-J et al.Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East respiratory syndrome.Epidemiol Health. 2016; 38: e2016048CrossrefPubMedScopus (12)Google Scholar Activating your social network, albeit remotely, is not just a key priority, but an inability to do so is associated not just with immediate anxiety, but longer- term distress.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar,  42Rubin GJ Brewin CR Greenberg N Simpson J Wessely S Psychological and behavioural reactions to the bombings in London on 7 July 2005: cross sectional survey of a representative sample of Londoners.BMJ. 2005; 331: 606CrossrefPubMedScopus (154)Google Scholar One study21Maunder R Hunter J Vincent L et al.The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital.CMAJ. 2003; 168: 1245-1251PubMedGoogle Scholar suggested that having a telephone support line, staffed by psychiatric nurses, set up specifically for those in quarantine could be effective in terms of providing them with a social network. The ability to communicate with one's family and friends is also essential. Particularly, social media could play an important part in communication with those far away, allowing people who are quarantined to update their loved ones about their situation and reassure them that they are well. Therefore, providing those quarantined with mobile phones, cords and outlets for charging devices, and robust WiFi networks with internet access to allow them to communicate directly with loved ones could reduce feelings of isolation, stress, and panic.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Although this is possible to achieve in enforced quarantine, it could be more difficult to do in the case of widespread home quarantine; countries imposing censors on social media and messaging applications could also present difficulties in ensuring lines of communication between those quarantined and their loved ones. It is also important that public health officials maintain clear lines of communication with people quarantined about what to do if they experience any symptoms. A phone line or online service specifically set up for those in quarantine and staffed by health-care workers who can provide instructions about what to do in the event of developing illness symptoms, would help reassure people that they will be cared for if they become ill. This service would show those who are quarantined that they have not been forgotten and that their health needs are just as important as those of the wider public. The benefits of such a resource have not been studied, but it is likely that reassurance could subsequently decrease feelings such as fear, worry, and anger. There is evidence to suggest that support groups specifically for people who were quarantined at home during disease outbreaks can be helpful. One study23Pan PJD Chang S-H Yu Y-Y A support group for home-quarantined college students exposed to SARS: learning from practice.J Spec Group Work. 2005; 30: 363-374CrossrefScopus (4)Google Scholar found that having such a group and feeling connected to others who had been through the same situation could be a validating, empowering experience and can provide people with the support they might find they are not receiving from other people. Health-care workers themselves are often quarantined and this Review suggests they, like the general public, are negatively affected by stigmatising attitudes from others. None of the studies included in this Review focused on the perceptions of their colleagues, but this would be an interesting aspect to explore. It is also possible that health-care workers who are quarantined might be concerned about causing their workplaces to be understaffed and causing extra work for their colleagues21Maunder R Hunter J Vincent L et al.The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital.CMAJ. 2003; 168: 1245-1251PubMedGoogle Scholar and that their colleagues' perceptions could be particularly important. Being separated from a team they are used to working in close contact with might add to feelings of isolation for health-care workers who are quarantined. Therefore, it is essential that they feel supported by their immediate colleagues. During infectious disease outbreaks, organisational support has been found to be protective of mental health for health-care staff in general39Brooks SK Dunn R Amlôt R Rubin GJ Greenberg N A systematic, thematic review of social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in healthcare employees during an infectious disease outbreak.J Occup Environ Med. 2018; 60: 248-257CrossrefPubMedScopus (3)Google Scholar and managers should take steps to ensure their staff members are supportive of their colleagues who are quarantined. Perhaps because of the difficulties of designing an appropriate study, no research was found which tested whether mandatory versus voluntary quarantine has a differential effect on wellbeing. In other contexts, however, feeling that others will benefit from one's situation can make stressful situations easier to bear and it seems likely that this is also true for home-based quarantine. Reinforcing that quarantine is helping to keep others safe, including those particularly vulnerable (such as those who are very young, old, or with pre-existing serious medical conditions), and that health authorities are genuinely grateful to them, can only help to reduce the mental health effect and adherence in those quarantined.19Liu X Kakade M Fuller CJ et al.Depression after exposure to stressful events: lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic.Compr Psychiatry. 2012; 53: 15-23CrossrefPubMedScopus (6)Google Scholar,  33Wu P Fang Y Guan Z et al.The psychological impact of the SARS epidemic on hospital employees in China: exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk.Can J Psychiatry. 2009; 54: 302-311CrossrefPubMedScopus (33)Google Scholar Notably, altruism has its limits if people are being asked to quarantine without adequate information on how to keep the people they live with safe. It is unacceptable to ask people to self-quarantine for the benefit of the community's health, when while doing so they might be putting their loved ones at risk. Quarantine is one of several public health measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and as shown in this Review, has a considerable psychological impact for those affected. As such, there is a question as to whether other public health measures that prevent the need to impose quarantine (such as social distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, and school closures) might be more favourable. Future research is needed to establish the effectiveness of such measures. The strengths and limitations of this Review must be considered. Because of the time constraints of this Review given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the reviewed literature did not undergo formal quality appraisal. Additionally, the Review was limited to peer-reviewed publications and we did not explore potentially relevant grey literature. The recommendations we have made apply primarily to small groups of people in dedicated facilities and to some extent in self-isolation. Although we anticipate that many of the risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes would be the same for larger containment processes (such as entire towns or cities), there are likely to be distinct differences in such situations that mean that the information presented in this Review should only be applied to such situations cautiously. Furthermore, potential cultural differences need to be considered. Although this Review cannot predict exactly what will happen or provide recommendations that will work for every future population that is quarantined, we have provided an overview of the key issues and how they could be rectified in the future. There are also several limitations of the reviewed literature, which must be pointed out: only one study followed up participants over time, sample sizes were generally small, few studies directly compared participants quarantined with those not quarantined, conclusions based on certain study populations (eg, students) might not be generalisable to the wider public, and heterogeneity of outcome measures across studies make it difficult to make direct comparisons between studies. It is also worth pointing out that a minority of studies assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress using measures designed to measure post-traumatic stress disorder, despite quarantine not being qualified as a trauma in the diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5.43American Psychiatric AssociationDiagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5.  American Psychiatric Association,        Arlington, VA2013CrossrefGoogle Scholar Strengths of this Review include the hand-searching of reference lists to identify any papers not found in the initial search, contacting authors who sent full-texts of papers which were not available in full online, and having multiple researchers carry out the screening to improve the rigour of the Review. Overall, this Review suggests that the psychological impact of quarantine is wide-ranging, substantial, and can be long lasting. This is not to suggest that quarantine should not be used; the psychological effects of not using quarantine and allowing disease to spread might be worse.44Hull HF SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada.Emerging Infectious Diseases. 2005; 11: 354-355CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar However, depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled carefully. If quarantine is essential, then our results suggest that officials should take every measure to ensure that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people. This can be achieved by: telling people what is happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling. Health officials charged with implementing quarantine, who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security, should also remember that not everyone is in the same situation. If the quarantine experience is negative, the results of this Review suggest there can be long-term consequences that affect not just the people quarantined but also the health-care system that administered the quarantine and the politicians and public health officials who mandated it. Our search strategy was designed to inform this Review and a second review to be published elsewhere relating to adherence to quarantine. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The full list of search terms can be found in the appendix. In brief, we used a combination of terms relating to quarantine (eg, “quarantine” and “patient isolation”) and psychological outcomes (eg, “psych” and “stigma”). For studies to be included in this Review, they had to report on primary research, be published in peer-reviewed journals, be written in English or Italian (as these are the languages spoken by the current authors), include participants asked to enter into quarantine outside of a hospital environment for at least 24 hours, and include data on the prevalence of mental illness or psychological wellbeing, or on factors associated with mental illness or psychological wellbeing (ie, any predictors of psychological wellbeing during or after quarantine). The initial search yielded 3166 papers, of which 24 included relevant data and were included in this Review. The screening process is illustrated in the figure.

We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.MethodsWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.FindingsUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.InterpretationThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.FundingUK Medical Research Council.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, SSRN, Research Square, Virological, and Wellcome Open Research for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the search terms “coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, and similar terms, and “fatality”, up to March 6, 2020. Several studies have estimated the case fatality ratio (the percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed disease who die from the disease) and infection fatality ratio (the percentage of all infected individuals who die from the disease, including those with mild disease) of COVID-19 using a range of different statistical and modelling methods. Studies done solely in hospitalised patients report the highest fatality ratios (8–28%), representing the outcome for the most severely ill patients. Estimates of the population-level case fatality ratio from all case reports are in the range of 2–8%. Estimates of the infection fatality ratio averaged across all age-groups range from 0·2% to 1·6%, while estimates of the infection fatality ratio in the oldest age group (≥80 years) range from 8% to 36%. None of the identified studies had adjusted for differences in the denominator populations to obtain estimates that could be applied across populations. No other studies have estimated the proportion of infected individuals who will require hospitalisation.Added value of this studyBy synthesising data from across a range of surveillance settings, we obtained estimates of the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio that take into account the different denominator populations in the datasets. Our underlying assumption, that attack rates (ie, the probability of becoming infected) do not vary substantially by age, is consistent with previous studies for respiratory infections. Under this assumption, differences in age patterns among cases in Wuhan versus those elsewhere in China would probably due to under-ascertainment of cases, given the different surveillance systems in place. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis, with cases in Wuhan seen in older individuals, who would have been identified through attendance at hospital, whereas cases elsewhere in China being younger overall, which would be explained by the policy of testing those with a travel history to Wuhan. After correcting for these biases, we found that estimates of the case fatality ratio from China are consistent with those obtained from early international cases. Our age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio can be applied to any demography to give an estimate of the infection fatality ratio in older and younger populations. These estimates can be combined with estimates of the infection attack rate (approximately 80% for an unmitigated epidemic) to give rough projections of scale. Similarly, our estimates of the proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation can be combined with the infection attack rate to forecast health-care requirements.Implications of all the available evidenceOur estimates of the case fatality ratio for COVID-19, although lower than some of the crude estimates made to date, are substantially higher than for recent influenza pandemics (eg, H1N1 influenza in 2009). With the rapid geographical spread observed to date, COVID-19 therefore represents a major global health threat in the coming weeks and months. Our estimate of the proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation, when combined with likely infection attack rates (around 50–80%), show that even the most advanced health-care systems are likely to be overwhelmed. These estimates are therefore crucial to enable countries around the world to best prepare as the global pandemic continues to unfold.

Assessing the severity of COVID-19 is crucial to determine the appropriateness of mitigation strategies and to enable planning for health-care needs as epidemics unfold. However, crude case fatality ratios obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases can be misleading.9Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar,  10Lipsitch M Donnelly CA Fraser C et al.Potential biases in estimating absolute and relative case-fatality risks during outbreaks.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015; 9e0003846Google Scholar First, there can be a period of 2–3 weeks between a person developing symptoms, the case subsequently being detected and reported, and observation of the final clinical outcome. During a growing epidemic, the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown. Simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true case fatality ratio early in an epidemic.9Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar,  10Lipsitch M Donnelly CA Fraser C et al.Potential biases in estimating absolute and relative case-fatality risks during outbreaks.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015; 9e0003846Google Scholar,  11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Google Scholar This effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)12Donnelly CA Ghani AC Leung GM et al.Epidemiological determinants of spread of causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1761-1766Google Scholar and H1N19Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar influenza, and as such is widely recognised. Thus, many of the estimates of the case fatality ratio that have been obtained to date for COVID-19 correct for this effect.13Jung S Akhmetzhanov AR Hayashi K et al.Real-time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: inference using exported cases.J Clin Med. 2020; 9: E523Google Scholar,  14Mizumoto K Kagaya K Chowell G Yoshida-Nakaadachi-cho U Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan City: China, January–February, 2020.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 13.)

Ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated case fatality ratio downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic. Second, surveillance of a newly emerged pathogen is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases, especially at the start of an epidemic when diagnostic capacity is low (figure 1). Estimates of the case fatality ratio can thus be biased upwards until the extent of clinically milder disease is determined.9Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar Data from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan have primarily been obtained through hospital surveillance and, thus, are likely to represent patients with moderate or severe illness, with atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress being used to define suspected cases eligible for testing.7Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology TeamThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China.Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020; 41 (in Chinese).: 145-151Google Scholar In these individuals, clinical outcomes are likely to be more severe, so any estimates of the case fatality ratio will be higher. Elsewhere in mainland China and the rest of the world, countries and administrative regions alert to the risk of infection being imported via travel initially instituted surveillance for COVID-19 with a broader set of clinical criteria for defining a suspected case. These criteria typically included a combination of symptoms (eg, cough and fever) combined with recent travel history to the affected region (Wuhan, or Hubei province)2Chan JFW Yuan S Kok KH et al.A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster.Lancet. 2020; 395: 514-523Google Scholar,  17Xu XW Wu XX Jiang XG et al.Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series.BMJ. 2020; 368: m606Google Scholar. Such surveillance is likely to detect clinically mild cases but, by initially restricting testing to those with a travel history or link, might have missed other symptomatic cases.Figure 1Spectrum of COVID-19 casesShow full captionAt the top of the pyramid, those meeting the WHO case criteria for severe or critical cases are likely to be identified in the hospital setting, presenting with atypical viral pneumonia. These cases will have been identified in mainland China and among those categorised internationally as local transmission. Many more cases are likely to be symptomatic (ie, with fever, cough, or myalgia), but might not require hospitalisation. These cases will have been identified through links to international travel to high-risk areas and through contact-tracing of contacts of confirmed cases. They might also be identified through population surveillance of, for example, influenza-like illness. The bottom part of the pyramid represents mild (and possibly asymptomatic) cases.

They might also be identified through population surveillance of, for example, influenza-like illness. The bottom part of the pyramid represents mild (and possibly asymptomatic) cases. These cases might be identified through contact tracing and subsequently via serological testing. Here we attempt to adjust for these biases in data sources to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio (proportion of all cases that will eventually lead to death) and infection fatality ratio (the proportion of all infections that will eventually lead to death) using both individual-level case report data and aggregate case and death counts from mainland China, from Hong Kong and Macau, and international case reports. By adjusting for both underlying demography and potential under-ascertainment at different levels of the severity pyramid (figure 1), these estimates should be broadly applicable across a range of settings to inform health planning while more detailed case data accrue. We identified information on the characteristics of 48 patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, reported by the National Health Commission and the Hubei Province Health Commission website up to Feb 8, 2020. We recorded the following data elements, where available: sex, age, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, and date of death. Of the 48 cases, neither the date of symptom onset nor the date of report was available for 13 cases. We also removed eight cases with onset before Jan 1, 2020, or death before Jan 21, 2020, and three deaths after Jan 28, 2020, which were the dates consistent with reliable reporting of onset and death in this setting, respectively, considering the onset-to-death times (including early onsets creates a bias towards long onset-to-death times, reflecting under-ascertainment of deaths early on). This left 24 deaths, which we used to estimate the onset-to-death distribution. We collated data on 2010 cases reported in 37 countries and two special administrative regions of China (Hong Kong and Macau), from government or ministry of health websites and media reports, until Feb 25, 2020. We recorded the following information where available: country or administrative region in which the case was detected, whether the infection was acquired in China or abroad, date of travel, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, date of confirmation, date of recovery, and date of death. We used data from 165 recovered individuals with reported recovery dates and reported or imputed onset dates to estimate the onset-to-recovery distribution, after excluding 26 recoveries without appropriate information on dates of recovery, report, or locality. We used data on 1334 international cases to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio, not including cases without dates of report. Data on 70 117 PCR-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases by date of onset in Wuhan and elsewhere in China from Jan 1 to Feb 11, 2020, were extracted from the WHO–China Joint Mission report.8WHOReport of the WHO-China Joint Mission on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).https://www.who.int/publications-detail/report-of-the-who-china-joint-mission-on-coronavirus-disease-2019-(covid-19)Date: Feb 28, 2020Date accessed: March 26, 2020Google Scholar Over this period a total of 1023 deaths were reported across China, with these data available disaggregated into 10-year age bands between 0–9 years and 70–79 years old, and a further age band for those aged 80 years or older.7Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology TeamThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China.Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020; 41 (in Chinese).: 145-151Google Scholar Using collated data on daily reported deaths obtained each day from the National Health Commission regional websites, we estimated that 74% of deaths occurred in Wuhan and the remainder outside Wuhan.

Data on infection prevalence in repatriated expatriates returning to their home countries were obtained from government or ministry of health websites and media reports. To match to the incidence reported in Wuhan on Jan 30, 2020, we used data from six flights that departed between Jan 30 and Feb 1, 2020, inclusive. In early February 2020 a cruise liner named the Diamond Princess was quarantined after a disembarked passenger tested positive for the virus. Subsequently all 3711 passengers on board were tested over the next month. We extracted data on the ages of passengers onboard on Feb 5, 2020, the dates of positive test reports, which were available for 657 out of 712 PCR-confirmed cases, and the dates of ten deaths among these cases from the reports of the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare19Government of JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare.https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e.htmlDate: 2020Date accessed: March 26, 2020Google Scholar and international media.

All analyses were done with R software (version 3.6.2), with Bayesian Marko-Chain Monte Carlo via the package drjacoby (version 1.0.0).21Verity R Winskill P drjacoby.https://mrc-ide.github.io/drjacoby/index.htmlDate accessed: March 26, 2020Google Scholar Data and code are available online at GitHub. In estimating time intervals between symptom onset and outcome, it was necessary to account for the fact that, during a growing epidemic, a higher proportion of the cases will have been infected recently (appendix p 7). Therefore, we re-parameterised a gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 0·14 per day, obtained from the early case onset data (appendix p 6). Using Bayesian methods, we fitted gamma distributions to the data on time from onset to death and onset to recovery, conditional on having observed the final outcome. Missing onset dates were imputed on the basis of dates of report, where available. Estimates of the distribution of times from onset-to-death were used to project the expected cumulative number of deaths given the onsets observed in Wuhan and outside Wuhan, assuming a uniform attack rate across age groups. Using the age-distribution of the population, we obtained an estimate of the expected number of infections in each age group. Under-ascertainment was estimated in and outside of Wuhan by comparing the number of observed cases by age to this expected distribution, assuming perfect ascertainment in the 50–59 age group as this group had the highest number of detected cases relative to population size. We also did a sensitivity analysis assuming a differential attack rate by age (appendix p 9). For Wuhan, we added scaling to account for further under-ascertainment compared with outside of Wuhan. These steps gave us the expected age-distribution of cases. For a given onset-to-death distribution, we obtained a modelled estimate of the cumulative number of deaths by age under an age-dependent case fatality ratio (fitted relative to the case fatality ratio in the oldest age group, which represented the highest crude case fatality ratio). This estimate was compared with the observed deaths by age using a Poisson likelihood. These data were then jointly fitted alongside the most recent age-aggregated cumulative deaths and cases in mainland China. Given that the numbers of observed cases and deaths have dropped substantially following a peak in late January, the ratio of current cumulative cases to current number of deaths, once corrected for under-ascertainment, should provide a good estimate of the final case fatality ratio.11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Google Scholar To estimate the infection fatality ratio we fitted to data on infection prevalence from international Wuhan residents who were repatriated to their home countries. Our age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio model was jointly fitted to the case data and infection prevalence data with use of Bayesian methods, using our previous estimate of the onset-to-death distribution as a prior. Full mathematical details are provided in the appendix (p 8). Assuming a uniform attack rate by age groups, we used the demography-adjusted under-ascertainment rates calculated above to obtain an estimate of the proportion of infected individuals who would require hospitalisation. To independently validate our infection fatality ratio estimate, we analysed data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise liner taking the dates of reported positive tests as a proxy for onset date. We calculated the expected proportion of deaths observed until March 25, 2020, given the onset times and estimated onset-to-death distribution (appendix p 13). We used parametric and non-parametric methods11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Google Scholar,  22Griffin J Ghani A CASEFAT: Stata module for estimating the case fatality ratio of a new infectious disease.

Cases in which the outcome was unknown were treated as censored observations. For parametric and non-parametric analyses, missing onset dates were multiply imputed using information on the onset-to-report distribution, and unreported recoveries were imputed using onset-to-outcome distributions and country summary data. The parametric models were fitted to the data using Bayesian methods (appendix p 12). The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. In the subset of 24 deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in mainland China early in the epidemic, with correction for bias introduced by the growth of the epidemic, we estimated the mean time from onset to death to be 18·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 15·7–49·7; figure 2) with a coefficient of variation of 0·45 (95% CrI 0·29–0·54). With the small number of observations in these data and given that they were from early in the epidemic, we could not rule out many deaths occurring with longer times from onset to death, hence the high upper limit of the credible interval. However, given that the epidemic in China has since declined, our posterior estimate of the mean time from onset to death, informed by the analysis of aggregated data from China, is more precise (mean 17·8 days [16·9–19·2]; figure 2).Figure 2Onset-to-death and onset-to-recovery distributionsShow full caption(A) Onset-to-death data from 24 cases in mainland China early in the epidemic.

Both these onset-to-outcome estimates are consistent with a separate study in China.23Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020;  (published online March 11.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3Google Scholar Case fatality ratios were estimated from aggregate data on cases and deaths in mainland China (table 1). A large proportion of the cases, including all of those early in the epidemic, were reported in Wuhan, where the local health system was quickly overwhelmed. As a result, the age distribution of cases reported in Wuhan differed to that in the rest of China (figure 3A). Reported cases in Wuhan were more frequent in older age groups, perhaps reflecting higher severity (and therefore prioritisation for hospitalisation in Wuhan), while cases outside of Wuhan might also show a bias in terms of the relationship between age and travel. Adjusting for differences in underlying demography and assuming no overall difference in the attack rate by age, we estimated high under-ascertainment of cases in younger age groups both inside and outside of Wuhan (figure 3C, D). Furthermore, we estimated a higher level of under-ascertainment overall in Wuhan compared with outside of Wuhan (figure 3C). Accounting for this under-ascertainment, we estimated the highest case fatality ratio (13·4% [11·2–15·9%]) in the 80 years and older age group (figure 3B, table 1), with lower case fatality ratios associated with lower age groups, and the lowest in the 0–9 years age group (0·00260% [0·000312–0·0382]).Table 1Estimates of case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio obtained from aggregate time series of cases in mainland ChinaDeathsLaboratory-confirmed cases** Values do not include the clinically diagnosed cases included in our estimates.Case fatality ratioInfection fatality ratio†† Obtained by combining estimates of case fatality ratios with information on infection prevalence obtained from those returning home on repatriation flights.CrudeAdjusted for censoringAdjusted for censoring, demography, and under-ascertainment‡‡ Accounts for the underlying demography in Wuhan and elsewhere in China and corrects for under-ascertainment.Overall102344 6722·29% (2·15–2·43)3·67% (3·56–3·80)1·38% (1·23–1·53)0·657% (0·389–1·33)Age group, years0–904160·000% (0·000–0·883)0·0954% (0·0110–1·34)0·00260% (0·000312–0·0382)0·00161% (0·000185–0·0249)10–1915490·182% (0·00461–1·01)0·352% (0·0663–1·74)0·0148% (0·00288–0·0759)0·00695% (0·00149–0·0502)20–29736190·193% (0·0778–0·398)0·296% (0·158–0·662)0·0600% (0·0317–0·132)0·0309% (0·0138–0·0923)30–391876000·237% (0·140–0·374)0·348% (0·241–0·577)0·146% (0·103–0·255)0·0844% (0·0408–0·185)40–493885710·443% (0·314–0·608)0·711% (0·521–0·966)0·295% (0·221–0·422)0·161% (0·0764–0·323)50–5913010 0081·30% (1·09–1·54)2·06% (1·74–2·43)1·25% (1·03–1·55)0·595% (0·344–1·28)60–6930985833·60% (3·22–4·02)5·79% (5·20–6·34)3·99% (3·41–4·55)1·93% (1·11–3·89)70–7931239187·96% (7·13–8·86)12·7% (11·5–13·9)8·61% (7·48–9·99)4·28% (2·45–8·44)≥80208140814·8% (13·0–16·7)23·3% (20·3–26·7)13·4% (11·2–15·9)7·80% (3·80–13·3)Age category (binary), years<6019430 7630·631% (0·545–0·726)1·01% (0·900–1·17)0·318% (0·274–0·378)0·145% (0·0883–0·317)≥6082913 9095·96% (5·57–6·37)9·49% (9·11–9·95)6·38% (5·70–7·17)3·28% (1·82–6·18)Crude case fatality ratios are presented as mean (95% confidence interval).

In international Wuhan residents repatriated on six flights, we estimated a prevalence of infection of 0·87% (95% CI 0·32–1·9; six of 689). Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we estimate an infection fatality ratio of 0·66% (95% CrI 0·39–1·33). As for the case fatality ratio, this is strongly age-dependent, with estimates rising steeply from age 50 years upwards (table 1). The demography-adjusted and under-ascertainment-adjusted proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation ranges from 1·1% in the 20–29 years age group up to 18·4% in those 80 years and older (table 3). Using these age-stratified infection fatality ratio estimates, we estimate the infection fatality ratio in the Diamond Princess population to be 2·9%. Given the delay from onset of symptoms to death, we would expect 97% of these deaths to have occurred by March 25, 2020, giving an estimate of the current infection fatality ratio of 2·8%, compared with the empirical estimate of 1·4% (95% CI 0·7–2·6; ten of 712).Table 3Estimates of the proportion of all infections that would lead to hospitalisation, obtained from a subset of cases reported in mainland China18Yang Y Lu Q Liu M et al.Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online Feb 21.)

This value was consistent with the infection fatality ratio observed in passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship up to March 5, 2020, although it is slightly above the upper 95% confidence limit of the age-adjusted infection fatality ratio observed by March 25 (of 712 confirmed cases, 601 have been discharged, ten have died, and 11 remain in a critical condition). This difference might be due to repatriation flight data slightly underestimating milder infections, or due to cruise passengers having better outcomes because of a potentially higher-than-average quality of health care. Our estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases require hospitalisation. This assumption is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in China, where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation. Mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations, given that the risks associated with COVID-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying comorbidities. Our estimate of the case fatality ratio is substantially lower than the crude case fatality ratio obtained from China based on the cases and deaths observed to date, which is currently 3·67%, as well as many of the estimates currently in the literature. The principle reason for this difference is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases. For example, various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms (for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history)13Jung S Akhmetzhanov AR Hayashi K et al.Real-time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: inference using exported cases.J Clin Med. 2020; 9: E523Google Scholar through to those identified in the hospital setting.14Mizumoto K Kagaya K Chowell G Yoshida-Nakaadachi-cho U Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan City: China, January–February, 2020.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 13.)

Our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20 years. As there are very few cases in this age group, it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility, although early results indicate young people are not at lower risk of infection than adults.28Bi Q Wu Y Mei S et al.Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 19.) (preprint).DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423Google Scholar Serological testing in this age group will be crucial in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age group in driving population transmission. The estimated increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case reports, in which the mean age tends to be in the range of 50–60 years. Different surveillance systems will pick up a different age case mix, and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through a history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance. Our correction for this surveillance bias therefore allows us to obtain estimates that can be applied to different case mixes and demographic population structures. However, it should be noted that this correction is applicable under the assumption of a uniform infection attack rate (ie, exposure) across the population. We also assumed perfect case ascertainment outside of Wuhan in the age group with the most cases relative to their population size (50–59-year-olds); however, if many cases were missed, the case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio estimates might be lower. In the absence of random population surveys of infection prevalence, our adjustment from case fatality ratio to infection fatality ratio relied on repatriation flight data, which was not age specific. The reported proportion of infected individuals who were asymptomatic on the Diamond Princess did not vary considerably by age, supporting this approach, but future larger representative population prevalence surveys and seroprevalence surveys will inform such estimates further. Much of the data informing global estimates of the case fatality ratio at present are from the early outbreak in Wuhan. Given that the health system in this city was quickly overwhelmed, our estimates suggest that there is substantial under-ascertainment of cases in the younger age groups (who we estimate to have milder disease) by comparison with elsewhere in mainland China. This under-ascertainment is the main factor driving the difference between our estimate of the crude case fatality ratio from China (3·67%) and our best estimate of the overall case fatality ratio (1·38%). The case fatality ratio is likely to be strongly influenced by the availability of health-care facilities. However surprisingly, although health-care availability in Wuhan was stretched, our estimates from international cases are of a similar magnitude, suggesting relatively little difference in health outcome. Finally, as clinical knowledge of this new disease accrues, it is possible that outcomes will improve. It will therefore be important to revise these estimates as epidemics unfold. The world is currently experiencing the early stages of a global pandemic. Although China has succeeded in containing the disease spread for 2 months, such containment is unlikely to be achievable in most countries. Thus, much of the world will experience very large community epidemics of COVID-19 over the coming weeks and months. Our estimates of the underlying infection fatality ratio of this virus will inform assessments of health effects likely to be experienced in different countries, and thus decisions around appropriate mitigation policies to be adopted.

He was born in Rio Pardo, Brazil, on Jan 30, 1940, and died in Washington, DC, USA, on May 28, 2014, aged 74 years. The last case of polio in Latin America was detected in 1991 in the small Peruvian town of Pichanaki. 3 years later, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) declared the disease eradicated within its region. If one man can be said to deserve personal credit for this achievement, it is Ciro de Quadros. A physician trained in public health, he joined PAHO in 1977 to advise on matters related to immunisation, and to implement the Expanded Programme on Immunization in Latin America. “At that time vaccine coverage rates were only 5 to 20%”, says Donald Henderson, Professor of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh. “What Ciro did was amazing.” He persuaded countries to join what became a hemisphere-wide effort. “Within 5 or 6 years all except Haiti had well over 80% coverage.” de Quadros also created a fund for buying vaccines on behalf of PAHO members, one of the largest ever bulk purchasing schemes in the public sector. Countries were able to buy vaccines in quantities that would otherwise have been unaffordable. It was in 1985 that de Quadros put forward his programme for eliminating polio from the Americas, an ambition that Henderson admits to having viewed with scepticism. But he succeeded—and then managed something similar for indigenous measles. Henderson attributes de Quadros's success to the way he did his job. “He travelled extensively, he talked with staff, he talked with ministers. He persuaded them that it was their programme. He could help, yes—but it was their programme.” de Quadros trained at the Catholic School of Medicine in Porto Alegre, did a master's degree in public health, and in 1967 joined the Brazilian public health service working at a health centre in the Amazon region. He became involved in the smallpox campaign and, with three colleagues, began testing the value of a surveillance and containment strategy as an alternative to the proven but unaffordable policy of mass vaccination. Over the next 8 months they identified more than 100 cases of smallpox, vaccinated all their contacts, and succeeded in breaking the chain of transmission. On the strength of this achievement de Quadros became the chief epidemiologist to WHO's smallpox eradication programme in Ethiopia. “He took on smallpox in the field with something like ten Ethiopian health officers and a dozen or so US Peace Corps people”, recalls Henderson. “Ethiopia's a big place and the roads were terrible. He was working under very difficult conditions, but within 12 months they'd turned up 600 cases.” Among those Peace Corps volunteers was Peter Carrasco, now Director of the Secretariat of the International Association of Immunization Managers based at the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, DC. Two previous Peace Corps groups had dealt with all locations that were accessible by road. “When Ciro and I hooked up we were looking at the hardest parts of Ethiopia to get to”, Carrasco recalls. There was no way they could do the job on foot, so they started to use helicopters in the highlands and camels in the desert areas. It was after the success of the Ethiopian smallpox project that de Quadros joined PAHO to head up the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Between 1994 and 1998 he spent 4 years as special adviser on vaccines to the Director-General of WHO, but continued to work for PAHO until his retirement in 2002. Even then, he maintained his lifelong connection with vaccination through his appointment as a Vice-President of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington. Throughout de Quadros's life, Henderson thinks, if he was told something couldn't be done, he wanted to do it. And usually he succeeded. “His work was a marvellous illustration of community involvement in accomplishing a task”, says Henderson. “He understood management”, adds Carrasco. He used his smallpox experience in building the Expanded Programme on Immunization and ridding Latin America of polio. “He showed the doubters, and there were many of them, that polio could be eradicated. He was very practical and had very clear insights”, says Carrasco. Despite de Quadros's many awards and the medals, “he was very down to earth”, notes Carrasco. “He was the kind of man who could sit down with an ordinary health worker, have a beer with him, and motivate that guy to do a better job.” de Quadros is survived by a wife, two daughters, and two stepsons.",2020-05-12 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

In December, 2019, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, became the centre of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. By Jan 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), from these patients with virus-infected pneumonia,1Phelan AL Katz R Gostin LO The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Jan 30.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.1097Google Scholar,  2Gorbalenya AE Baker SC Baric RS et al.Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses—a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online Feb 11.)

To our knowledge, no previous studies have been done among patients with definite outcomes. The estimation of risk factors for severe disease and death in these earlier case series are therefore not very robust. Additionally, details of the clinical and virological course of illness have not yet been well described. Here, we present details of all patients admitted to the two designated hospitals in Wuhan—Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital—with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and a definite clinical outcome (death or discharge) as of Jan 31, 2020. We aim to explore risk factors of in-hospital death for patients and describe the clinical course of symptoms, viral shedding, and temporal changes of laboratory findings during hospitalisation. Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on Feb 23, 2020, for articles that documented the risk factors of mortality and viral shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the search terms (“novel coronavirus” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “COVID-19”) AND (“death” OR “mortality” OR “viral shedding”) with no language or time restrictions. Age, comorbidities, lymphocytopenia and elevated alanine aminotransferase, d-dimer, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, prothrombin time, and disease severity were reported to be associated with intensive care unit admission. However, no published works were found about the risk factors of mortality for adult patients with COVID-19. One study compared the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat and nasopharyngeal swab in 17 patients with COVID-19.Added value of this studyIn this retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients in two hospitals in Wuhan, China, we found increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer levels greater than 1·0 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Duration of viral shedding ranged between 8 and 37 days. The median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but continued until death in fatal cases.Implications of all the available evidenceOlder age, elevated d-dimer levels, and high SOFA score could help clinicians to identify at an early stage those patients with COVID-19 who have poor prognosis.

Added value of this study In this retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients in two hospitals in Wuhan, China, we found increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer levels greater than 1·0 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.

Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future. This retrospective cohort study included two cohorts of adult inpatients (≥18 years old) from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China). All adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were screened, and those who died or were discharged between Dec 29, 2019 (ie, when the first patients were admitted), and Jan 31, 2020, were included in our study. Since these two hospitals were the only designated hospitals for transfer of patients with COVID-19 from other hospitals in Wuhan until Feb 1, 2020, our study enrolled all adult inpatients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and had a definite outcome (dead or discharged) at the early stage of the outbreak. Before Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results were not available in the electronic medical records, from which data for this study were obtained retrospectively; therefore, this study includes 29 of the 41 patients originally reported on.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar The study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of Jinyintan Hospital (KY-2020–01.01) and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission as described previously.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardised data collection form, which was a modified version of the WHO/International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case record form for severe acute respiratory infections. All data were checked by two physicians (FZ and ZL) and a third researcher (GF) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers. Methods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described elsewhere.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Briefly, four institutions—the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences—were responsible for SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. From Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health institutions, and Jingyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Throat-swab specimens were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 PCR re-examination every other day after clinical remission of symptoms, including fever, cough, and dyspnoea, but only qualitative data were available. The criteria for discharge were absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs in chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained at least 24 h apart. Routine blood examinations were complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), myocardial enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin, and procalcitonin. Chest radiographs or CT scan were also done for all inpatients. Frequency of examinations was determined by the treating physician. Fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37·3°C. Sepsis and septic shock were defined according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Secondary infection was diagnosed when patients showed clinical symptoms or signs of pneumonia or bacteraemia and a positive culture of a new pathogen was obtained from lower respiratory tract specimens (qualified sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) or blood samples after admission.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Ventilator-associated pneumonia was diagnosed according to the guidelines for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia.8Kalil AC Metersky ML Klompas M et al.Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society.Clin Infect Dis. 2016; 63: e61-e111Google Scholar Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines9Khwaja A KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury.Nephron Clin Pract. 2012; 120: c179-c184Google Scholar and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition.10Ranieri VM Rubenfeld GD Thompson BT et al.Acute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin Definition.JAMA. 2012; 307: 2526-2533Google Scholar Acute cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or if new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar The illness severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0).11National Health Commission of the People's Republic of ChinaChinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0).http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202002/8334a8326dd94d329df351d7da8aefc2/files/b218cfeb1bc54639af227f922bf6b817.pdfDate: Feb 19, 2020Google Scholar Coagulopathy was defined as a 3-second extension of prothrombin time or a 5-second extension of activated partial thromboplastin time. Hypoproteinaemia was defined as blood albumin of less than 25 g/L. Exposure history was defined as exposure to people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the Wuhan seafood market. Continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%), respectively. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, χ2 test, or Fisher's exact test to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Considering the total number of deaths (n=54) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings and clinical constraints. Previous studies have shown blood levels of d-dimer and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to be higher in critically ill or fatal cases, whereas lymphopenia and cardiovascular disease have been less commonly observed in non-critical or surviving patients with SARS-COV-2 infection.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar,  6Wang D Hu B Hu C et al.Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Feb 7.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.1585Google Scholar,  12Yang X Yu Y Xu J et al.Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study.Lancet Respir Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 24)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5Google Scholar Similar risk factors, including older age, have been reported associated with adverse clinical outcomes in adults with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).3Chan JWM Ng CK Chan YH et al.Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).Thorax. 2003; 58: 686-689Google Scholar,  13Arabi YM Balkhy HH Hayden FG et al.Middle East respiratory syndrome.N Engl J Med. 2017; 376: 584-594Google Scholar Some laboratory findings, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, and IL-6, might be unavailable in emergency circumstances. Therefore, we chose lymphocyte count, d-dimer, SOFA score, coronary heart disease, and age as the five variables for our multivariable logistic regression model. We excluded variables from the univariable analysis if their between-group differences were not significant, if their accuracy was unconfirmed (eg, exposure, which was self-reported), if the number of events was too small to calculate odds ratios, and if they had colinearity with the SOFA score. We compared patient characteristics between the two hospitals and used a generalised linear model to adjust for possible differences in patients’ characteristics and treatment between the two study centres. A two-sided α of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software (version 9.4), unless otherwise indicated. The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors (BC and HC) had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 813 adult patients were hospitalised in Jinyintan Hospital or Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital with COVID-19 before Jan 31, 2020. After excluding 613 patients that were still hospitalised or not confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection as of Jan 31, 2020, and nine inpatients without available key information in their medical records, we included 191 inpatients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) in the final analysis. 54 patients died during hospitalisation and 137 were discharged. The median age of the 191 patients was 56·0 years (IQR 46·0–67·0), ranging from 18 years to 87 years, and most patients were male (table 1). Comorbidities were present in nearly half of patients, with hypertension being the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease (table 1). The most common symptoms on admission were fever and cough, followed by sputum production and fatigue (table 1). Lymphocytopenia occurred in 77 (40%) patients. 181 (95%) patients received antibiotics and 41 (21%) received antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir; table 2). Systematic corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin use differed significantly between non-survivors and survivors (table 2).

The median time from illness onset (ie, before admission) to discharge was 22·0 days (IQR 18·0–25·0), whereas the median time to death was 18·5 days (15·0–22·0; table 2). 32 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. The median time from illness onset to invasive mechanical ventilation was 14·5 days (12·0–19·0). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in three patients, none of whom survived. Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure, and septic shock (table 2). Half of non-survivors experienced a secondary infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The frequency of complications were higher in non-survivors than survivors (table 2). In univariable analysis, odds of in-hospital death was higher in patients with diabetes or coronary heart disease (table 3). Age, lymphopenia, leucocytosis, and elevated ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, IL-6, prothrombin time, creatinine, and procalcitonin were also associated with death (table 3).Table 3Risk factors associated with in-hospital deathUnivariable OR (95% CI)p valueMultivariable OR (95% CI)p valueDemographics and clinical characteristicsAge, years** Per 1 unit increase.1·14 (1·09–1·18)<0·00011·10 (1·03–1·17)0·0043Female sex (vs male)0·61 (0·31–1·20)0·15....Current smoker (vs non-smoker)2·23 (0·65–7·63)0·20....Comorbidity present (vs not present)Chronic obstructive lung disease5·40 (0·96–30·40)0·056....Coronary heart disease21·40 (4·64–98·76)<0·00012·14 (0·26–17·79)0·48Diabetes2·85 (1·35–6·05)0·0062....Hypertension3·05 (1·57–5·92)0·0010....Respiratory rate, breaths per min≤241 (ref)......>248·89 (4·34–18·19)<0·0001....SOFA score6·14 (3·48–10·85)<0·00015·65 (2·61–12·23)<0·0001qSOFA score12·00 (5·06–28·43)<0·0001....Laboratory findingsWhite blood cell count, × 109 per L<40·73 (0·26–2·10)0·56....4–101 (ref)......>106·60 (3·02–14·41)<0·0001....Lymphocyte count, × 109 per L** Per 1 unit increase.0·02 (0·01–0·08)<0·00010·19 (0·02–1·62)0·13ALT, U/L≤401 (ref)......>402·87 (1·48–5·57)0·0018....Creatinine, μmol/L≤1331 (ref)......>1334·39 (1·01–19·06)0·048....Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L≤2451 (ref)......>24545·43 (6·10–338·44)0·0002....Creatine kinase, U/L≤1851 (ref)......>1852·56 (1·03–6·36)0·043....High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, pg/mL≤281 (ref)......>2880·07 (10·34–620·36)<0·0001....D-dimer, μg/mL≤0·51 (ref)..1 (ref)..> 0·51·96 (0·52–7·43)0·322·14 (0·21–21·39)0·52> 120·04 (6·52–61·56)<0·000118·42 (2·64–128·55)0·0033Prothrombin time, s<161 (ref)......≥164·62 (1·29–16·50)0·019....Serum ferritin, μg/L≤3001 (ref)......>3009·10 (2·04–40·58)0·0038....IL-6, pg/mL** Per 1 unit increase.1·12 (1·03–1·23)0·0080....Procalcitonin, ng/mL** Per 1 unit increase.13·75 (1·81–104·40)0·011....OR=odds ratio.

We included 171 patients with complete data for all variables (53 non-survivors and 118 survivors) in the multivariable logistic regression model. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL at admission were associated with increased odds of death (table 3). When adjusting for study centre, our generalised linear model showed similar results (appendix p 5). For survivors, the median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) from illness onset, but the virus was continuously detectable until death in non-survivors (table 2; figure 1). The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. Among 29 patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir and were discharged, the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14·0 days (IQR 10·0–17·0) and the median duration of viral shedding was 22·0 days (18·0–24·0). The median duration of viral shedding was 19·0 days (17·0–22·0) in patients with severe disease status and 24·0 days (22·0–30·0) in patients with critical disease status.Figure 1Clinical courses of major symptoms and outcomes and duration of viral shedding from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19Show full captionFigure shows median duration of symptoms and onset of complications and outcomes.

Major laboratory markers were tracked from illness onset (figure 2). Baseline lymphocyte count was significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors; in survivors, lymphocyte count was lowest on day 7 after illness onset and improved during hospitalisation, whereas severe lymphopenia was observed until death in non-survivors. Levels of d-dimer, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course, and increased with illness deterioration (figure 2). In non-survivors, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I increased rapidly from day 16 after disease onset, whereas lactate dehydrogenase increased for both survivors and non-survivors in the early stage of illness, but decreased from day 13 for survivors.Figure 2Temporal changes in laboratory markers from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19Show full captionFigure shows temporal changes in d-dimer (A), lymphocytes (B), IL-6 (C), serum ferritin (D), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (E), and lactate dehydrogenase (F). Differences between survivors and non-survivors were significant for all timepoints shown, except for day 4 after illness onset for d-dimer, IL-6, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I.

Median time from illness onset to dyspnoea was similar in survivors and non-survivors, with a median duration of dyspnoea of 13·0 days (9·0–16·5) for survivors (table 2; figure 1). In survivors, the median duration of fever was 12·0 days (8·0–13·0) and cough persisted for 19·0 days (IQR 12·0–23·0; figure 1). 62 (45%) survivors still had cough on discharge and 39 (72%) non-survivors still had cough at the time of death. The dynamic profiles of fever, cough, and dyspnoea are shown in the appendix (p 6). Sepsis developed at a median of 9·0 days (7·0–13·0) after illness onset among all patients, followed by ARDS (12·0 days [8·0–15·0]), acute cardiac injury (15·0 days [10·0–17·0]), acute kidney injury (15·0 days [13·0–19·5]), and secondary infection (17·0 days [13·0–19·0]). The initiation time and duration of systematic corticosteroid use was also similar between the two groups. Among non-survivors, the median time from illness onset was 10·0 days (7·0–14·0) to sepsis, 12·0 days (8·0–15·0) to ARDS, 14·5 days (9·5–17·0) to acute cardiac injury, and 17·0 days (13·0–19·0) to secondary infection (figure 1; table 2). Among survivors, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury were observed in one patient each, occurring 9 days (acute kidney injury), 14 days (secondary infection), and 21 days (acute cardiac injury) after illness onset. The median time from dyspnoea to intubation was 10·0 days (IQR 5·0–12·5) for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation and the time from invasive mechanical ventilation to occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 8·0 days (2·0–9·0; figure 1). This retrospective cohort study identified several risk factors for death in adults in Wuhan who were hospitalised with COVID-19. In particular, older age, d-dimer levels greater than 1 μg/mL, and higher SOFA score on admission were associated with higher odds of in-hospital death. Additionally, elevated levels of blood IL-6, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and lactate dehydrogenase and lymphopenia were more commonly seen in severe COVID-19 illness. Sustained viral detection in throat samples was observed in both survivors and non-survivors. Previously, older age has been reported as an important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS.14Choi KW Chau TN Tsang O et al.Outcomes and prognostic factors in 267 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.Ann Intern Med. 2003; 139: 715-723Google Scholar,  15Hong K-H Choi J-P Hong S-H et al.Predictors of mortality in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).Thorax. 2018; 73: 286-289Google Scholar The current study confirmed that increased age was associated with death in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies in macaques inoculated with SARS-CoV found that older macaques had stronger host innate responses to virus infection than younger adults, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, whereas expression of type I interferon beta was reduced.16Smits SL de Lang A van den Brand JMA et al.Exacerbated innate host response to SARS-CoV in aged non-human primates.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000756-eGoogle Scholar The age-dependent defects in T-cell and B-cell function and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a deficiency in control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses, potentially leading to poor outcome.17Opal SM Girard TD Ely EW The immunopathogenesis of sepsis in elderly patients.Clin Infect Dis. 2005; 41: S504-S512Google Scholar SOFA score is a good diagnostic marker for sepsis and septic shock, and reflects the state and degree of multi-organ dysfunction.18Singer M Deutschman CS Seymour CW et al.The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).JAMA. 2016; 315: 801-810Google Scholar,  19Ferreira FL Bota DP Bross A Mélot C Vincent JL Serial evaluation of the SOFA score to predict outcome in critically ill patients.JAMA. 2001; 286: 1754-1758Google Scholar Although bacterial infections are usually regarded as a leading cause of sepsis, viral infection can also cause sepsis syndrome. Previously, we determined that sepsis occurred in nearly 40% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia due to viral infection.20Zhou F Wang Y Liu Y et al.Disease severity and clinical outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses in adults: a multicentre prospective registry study from the CAP-China Network.Eur Respir J. 2019; 54: 1802406Google Scholar In the current study, we found that more than half of patients developed sepsis. Additionally, we found that more than 70% of patients had white blood cell count below 10·0 × 109 per L or procalcitonin below 0·25 ng/mL, and no bacterial pathogens were detected in these patients on admission. Sepsis was a common complication, which might be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis of sepsis in COVID-19 illness. Cardiac complications, including new or worsening heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction are common in patients with pneumonia. Cardiac arrest occurs in about 3% of inpatients with pneumonia.21Marrie TJ Shariatzadeh MR Community-acquired pneumonia requiring admission to an intensive care unit: a descriptive study.Medicine (Baltimore). 2007; 86: 103-111Google Scholar Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation.22Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Shachkina S Chirinos JA Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system.Lancet. 2013; 381: 496-505Google Scholar Coronary heart disease has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections.22Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Shachkina S Chirinos JA Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system.Lancet. 2013; 381: 496-505Google Scholar,  23Udell JA Zawi R Bhatt DL et al.Association between influenza vaccination and cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients: a meta-analysis.JAMA. 2013; 310: 1711-1720Google Scholar,  24Blackburn R Zhao H Pebody R Hayward A Warren-Gash C Laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections as predictors of hospital admission for myocardial infarction and stroke: time-series analysis of English data for 2004–2015.Clin Infect Dis. 2018; 67: 8-17Google Scholar In this study, increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I during hospitalisation was found in more than half of those who died.

About 90% of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity, marked by increased d-dimer concentrations.25Milbrandt EB Reade MC Lee M et al.Prevalence and significance of coagulation abnormalities in community-acquired pneumonia.Mol Med. 2009; 15: 438-445Google Scholar In this study, we found d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL is associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19.

Of note, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue has been documented in fatal cases of COVID-19, although viral detection studies were not reported.32Xu Z Shi L Wang Y et al.Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.Lancet Respir Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 18)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-XGoogle Scholar The level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of transmission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. For SARS-CoV, viral RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from about a third of patients as long as 4 weeks after disease onset.33Xu D Zhang Z Jin L et al.Persistent shedding of viable SARS-CoV in urine and stool of SARS patients during the convalescent phase.Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2005; 24: 165-171Google Scholar Similarly, the duration of MERS-CoV RNA detection in lower respiratory specimans persisted for at least 3 weeks,34Corman VM Albarrak AM Omrani AS et al.Viral shedding and antibody response in 37 patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection.Clin Infect Dis. 2016; 62: 477-483Google Scholar,  35Oh MD Park WB Choe PG et al.Viral load kinetics of MERS coronavirus infection.N Engl J Med. 2016; 375: 1303-1405Google Scholar whereas the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection has not been well characterised. In the current study, we found that the detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for a median of 20 days in survivors and that it was sustained until death in non-survivors. This has important implications for both patient isolation decision making and guidance around the length of antiviral treatment. In severe influenza virus infection, prolonged viral shedding was associated with fatal outcome and delayed antiviral treatment was an independent risk factor for prolonged virus detection.36Wang Y Guo Q Yan Z et al.Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding in patients with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection.J Infect Dis. 2018; 217: 1708-1717Google Scholar Similarly, effective antiviral treatment might improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in the current study. Randomised clinical trials for lopinavir/ritonavir (ChiCTR2000029308) and intravenous remdesivir (NCT04257656, NCT04252664) in treatment of COVID-19 are currently in progress. Our study has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective study design, not all laboratory tests were done in all patients, including lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and serum ferritin. Therefore, their role might be underestimated in predicting in-hospital death. Second, patients were sometimes transferred late in their illness to the two included hospitals. Lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high-dose corticosteroid use might have also contributed to the poor clinical outcomes in some patients. Third, the estimated duration of viral shedding is limited by the frequency of respiratory specimen collection, lack of quantitative viral RNA detection, and relatively low positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat-swabs.37Zou L Ruan F Huang M et al.SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMc2001737Google Scholar Fourth, by excluding patients still in hospital as of Jan 31, 2020, and thus relatively more severe disease at an earlier stage, the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of COVID-19. Last but not least, interpretation of our findings might be limited by the sample size. However, by including all adult patients in the two designated hospitals for COVID-19, we believe our study population is representative of cases diagnosed and treated in Wuhan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort study among patients with COVID-19 who have experienced a definite outcome. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and elevated d-dimer at admission were risk factors for death of adult patients with COVID-19. The prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for testing novel coronavirus antiviral interventions in efforts to improve outcomes. This online publication has been corrected.

(preprint).DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546Google Scholar Here, we report the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions. We first measured the stability of SARS-CoV-2 at different temperatures. SARS-CoV-2 in virus transport medium (final concentration ∼6·8 log unit of 50% tissue culture infectious dose [TCID50] per mL) was incubated for up to 14 days and then tested for its infectivity (appendix p 1). The virus is highly stable at 4°C, but sensitive to heat. At 4°C, there was only around a 0·7 log-unit reduction of infectious titre on day 14. With the incubation temperature increased to 70°C, the time for virus inactivation was reduced to 5 mins. We further investigated the stability of this virus on different surfaces. Briefly, a 5 μL droplet of virus culture (∼7·8 log unit of TCID50 per mL) was pipetted on a surface (appendix p 1; ∼cm2 per piece) and left at room temperature (22°C) with a relative humidity of around 65%. The inoculated objects retrieved at desired time-points were immediately soaked with 200 μL of virus transport medium for 30 mins to elute the virus. Therefore, this recovery of virus does not necessarily reflect the potential to pick up the virus from casual contact. No infectious virus could be recovered from printing and tissue papers after a 3-hour incubation, whereas no infectious virus could be detected from treated wood and cloth on day 2. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on smooth surfaces. No infectious virus could be detected from treated smooth surfaces on day 4 (glass and banknote) or day 7 (stainless steel and plastic). Strikingly, a detectable level of infectious virus could still be present on the outer layer of a surgical mask on day 7 (∼0·1% of the original inoculum). Interestingly, a biphasic decay of infectious SARS-CoV-2 could be found in samples recovered from these smooth surfaces (appendix pp 2–7). 39 representative non-infectious samples tested positive by RT-PCR3Chu DKW Pan Y Cheng SMS et al.Molecular diagnosis of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia.Clin Chem. 2020;  (published online Jan 31.)DOI:10.1093/clinchem/hvaa029CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar (data not shown), showing that non-infectious viruses could still be recovered by the eluents. We also tested the virucidal effects of disinfectants by adding 15 μL of SARS-CoV-2 culture (∼7·8 log unit of TCID50 per mL) to 135 μL of various disinfectants at working concentration (appendix p 1). With the exception of a 5-min incubation with hand soap, no infectious virus could be detected after a 5-min incubation at room temperature (22°C). Additionally, we also found that SARS-CoV-2 is extremely stable in a wide range of pH values at room temperature (pH 3–10; appendix p 1). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly stable in a favourable environment,4van Doremalen N Bushmaker T Morris DH et al.Aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online March 17.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMc2004973CrossrefGoogle Scholar but it is also susceptible to standard disinfection methods.

As Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Oxford in the UK, and a leading scientist at the university's Jenner Institute, her research team wasted no time in getting involved. “We had recently started thinking about an appropriate response to Disease X; how could we mobilise and focus our resources to go more quickly than we had ever gone before. And then Disease X arrived”, she says. Once the genome sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became available in mid-January, Gilbert's team set to work to design a vaccine, using recombinant DNA techniques to create a SARS-CoV-2 antigen and embedding it within a primate adenovirus vector. “At this point it all felt quite theoretical, our goal then being to design a vaccine and to have a paper published showing what was possible in terms of a rapid response to an unknown outbreak, using our adenoviral vectored vaccine technology”, she says. Gilbert's team was awarded a £2·2 million grant from the UK's National Institute for Health Research and the UK Research and Innovation in March, 2020, to scale up her team's efforts to move into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine preclinical and clinical trials. “The way various grants have been awarded to different strategic aspects of the project is important, as much of the work can go on in parallel—for example, my colleague Sandy Douglas has received funding for work on scaling up vaccine manufacturing processes at the same time as we are progressing work in developing trials”, she says. Preclinical work at Public Health England's Porton Down facility is the immediate priority, complementing parallel initiatives taking place at the US National Institutes of Health and at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia, among others. Gilbert's team has received ethical approval for a clinical trial, and conditional approval from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to screen volunteers for trial enrolment. Another reason for speed is for her team to assess the efficacy of a vaccine in volunteers who have not yet been infected. “Ideally, we need the clinical trial to be taking place when the majority of volunteers have not been exposed to the virus. We will exclude volunteers who have a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, or who have had fever or cough in the past month. Some will inevitably have been exposed, and that is useful too, as we want to know what the vaccine means for people who have been exposed to the coronavirus”, she says. Gilbert's early vaccine work at the University of Oxford started in 1994 with Adrian Hill, who today is Director of the Jenner Institute, with a focus on malaria vaccine research, and, given her particular interest in cellular immunology, the importance of T-cell responses to parasite infection. “From what we were seeing in malaria endemic regions, individuals with a specific HLA type did much better after becoming infected with malaria than others with different HLA profiles. This led us to look at creating vaccine candidates that could trigger favourable T-cell responses, rather than relying solely on antibody responses, the prevailing vaccine model at that time”, she explains. This approach coincided with advancements in recombinant DNA techniques, with vaccinologists being able to generate specific antigens that could be safely incorporated in a host virus, as an alternative to the risks associated with using live attenuated vaccines. The ability to create recombinant viral vector vaccines is a core function of Gilbert's research group at the Jenner Institute, which over the past few years has progressed work on many vaccines, including those for influenza and Zika virus and early stage trials for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine, a helpful template for the work on a COVID-19 vaccine. As Chair of the management committee that oversees initial vaccine production within the University of Oxford, Gilbert and colleagues have suspended all other concurrent vaccine research to prioritise efforts on COVID-19. Gilbert is understandably cautious when asked to map out a timetable for the trial, but hopes to have vaccinated 500 volunteers by mid-May; this will be followed by an extension of the maximum age of trial volunteers from 55 to 70 years, later moving on to the over-70 age group. Phase 3 expansion is expected to involve 5000 volunteers; results from the earlier trials will be included in the efficacy follow-up. “The best-case scenario is that by the autumn of 2020, we have an efficacy result from phase 3 and the ability to manufacture large amounts of the vaccine, but these best-case timeframes are highly ambitious and subject to change”, Gilbert says. “Our ability to determine vaccine efficacy will be affected by the amount of virus transmission in the local population over the summer, and we are also beginning to think about initiating trials with partners in other countries to increase our ability to determine vaccine efficacy”, she says. Sharing knowledge with parallel COVID-19 vaccine efforts worldwide is crucial. “WHO is in the process of creating a forum for everyone who is developing COVID-19 vaccines to come together and present their plans and initial findings. It is essential that we all measure immunological responses to the various vaccines in the same way, to ensure comparability and generalisability of our collective findings. Work is continuing at a very fast pace, and I am in no doubt that we will see an unprecedented spirit of collaboration and cooperation, convened by WHO, as we move towards a shared global goal of COVID-19 prevention through vaccination”, Gilbert says.",2020-05-12 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China as well as 27 other countries and regions, with more than 70 000 confirmed cases as of Feb 17, 2020.2WHOCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation reports.https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reportsDate accessed: February 17, 2020Google Scholar In response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed an online interactive dashboard, hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualise and track reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in real time. The dashboard, first shared publicly on Jan 22, illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries for all affected countries. It was developed to provide researchers, public health authorities, and the general public with a user-friendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. All data collected and displayed are made freely available, initially through Google Sheets and now through a GitHub repository, along with the feature layers of the dashboard, which are now included in the Esri Living Atlas. The dashboard reports cases at the province level in China; at the city level in the USA, Australia, and Canada; and at the country level otherwise. During Jan 22–31, all data collection and processing were done manually, and updates were typically done twice a day, morning and night (US Eastern Time). As the outbreak evolved, the manual reporting process became unsustainable; therefore, on Feb 1, we adopted a semi-automated living data stream strategy. Our primary data source is DXY, an online platform run by members of the Chinese medical community, which aggregates local media and government reports to provide cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases in near real time at the province level in China and at the country level otherwise. Every 15 min, the cumulative case counts are updated from DXY for all provinces in China and for other affected countries and regions. For countries and regions outside mainland China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), we found DXY cumulative case counts to frequently lag behind other sources; we therefore manually update these case numbers throughout the day when new cases are identified. To identify new cases, we monitor various Twitter feeds, online news services, and direct communication sent through the dashboard. Before manually updating the dashboard, we confirm the case numbers with regional and local health departments, including the respective centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) of China, Taiwan, and Europe, the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Macau Government, and WHO, as well as city-level and state-level health authorities. For city-level case reports in the USA, Australia, and Canada, which we began reporting on Feb 1, we rely on the US CDC, the government of Canada, the Australian Government Department of Health, and various state or territory health authorities. All manual updates (for countries and regions outside mainland China) are coordinated by a team at Johns Hopkins University.

It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2–4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered. Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.

Public Health England,        London2014Google Scholar commissioned by the UK Department of Health in 2014, to inform influenza pandemic preparations, included 100 epidemiological and 45 modelling studies and concluded that school closures can reduce transmission of pandemic influenza if instituted early in outbreaks. School closures result in greater reductions in peak than in cumulative attack rates and, according to modelling studies, are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility (reproductive number [R] <2) and if attack rates are higher in children than in adults.

However, there was substantial evidence that transmission surged again once schools reopened, and there was little consensus on the appropriate timing of closures, let alone reopening of schools. One way that school closures are effective during outbreaks might be through forcing parents to work at home and thus reducing work-related contacts. However, reviews have also noted the adverse effects of school closure, including economic harms to working parents, health-care workers, and other key workers being forced from work to childcare, and to society due to loss of parental productivity, transmission from children to vulnerable grandparents, loss of education, harms to child welfare particularly among the most vulnerable pupils, and nutritional problems especially to children for whom free school meals are an important source of nutrition.8Jackson C Mangtani P Vynnycky E Impact of school closures on an influenza pandemic: scientific evidence base review.

The review concluded that few studies have been done but that a small number of modelling studies supported the use of alternative strategies during influenza outbreaks.22Lofgren ET Rogers J Senese M Fefferman NH Pandemic preparedness strategies for school systems: is closure the only way?.Ann Zool Fenn. 2008; 45: 449-458CrossrefScopus (5)Google Scholar,  23Ridenhour BJ Braun A Teyrasse T Goldsman D Controlling the spread of disease in schools.PLoS One. 2011; 6e29640CrossrefPubMedScopus (13)Google Scholar There were no UK studies included in this review.21Uscher-Pines L Schwartz HL Ahmed F et al.School practices to promote social distancing in K-12 schools: review of influenza pandemic policies and practices.BMC Public Health. 2018; 18: 406CrossrefPubMedScopus (3)Google Scholar In the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Taiwan instituted class suspensions rather than school closures, facilitated by keeping students in a homeroom class with a core teacher and having other teachers routinely moving between classes.

These actions appear largely based on assumptions that the benefits apparent in influenza outbreaks are also likely to be true for COVID-19. There are several theoretical reasons why school closures might be less effective in COVID-19 than in influenza outbreaks. Children contribute more to influenza transmission than do adults,25Wallinga J Teunis P Kretzschmar M Using data on social contacts to estimate age-specific transmission parameters for respiratory-spread infectious agents.Am J Epidemiol. 2006; 164: 936-944CrossrefPubMedScopus (315)Google Scholar with low levels of immunity and high levels of transmission due to symptomatic disease. However, in the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, children appear to form a much lower proportion of cases than expected from their population, although evidence for this is mixed and some data suggest that children might be as likely to be infected as adults but largely remain asymptomatic or have a mild form of the disease.26Shen K Yang Y Wang T et al.Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children: experts' consensus statement.World J Pediatr. 2020;  (published online February 7.)DOI:10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7Google Scholar It remains unclear whether the low proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases among children in mainland China relate to a reduced risk of infection, having subclinical or milder infections, or specific population factors (eg, one-child policy). Evidence of COVID-19 transmission through child–child contact or through schools is not yet available, although family transmission has an important role in the outbreak. In some previous coronavirus outbreaks, evidence suggested that transmission in schools was very low or absent.27Wong GW Li AM Ng PC Fok TF Severe acute respiratory syndrome in children.Pediatr Pulmonol. 2003; 36: 261-266CrossrefPubMedScopus (35)Google Scholar As modelling studies of school closures for influenza outbreaks rely on assumptions about the proportion of cases transmitted in schools being relatively high,28Cauchemez S Ferguson NM Wachtel C et al.Closure of schools during an influenza pandemic.Lancet Infect Dis. 2009; 9: 473-481SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (233)Google Scholar these models cannot be assumed to be informative regarding effectiveness for COVID-19. Emerging epidemiological data suggest little evidence of transmission of COVID-19 through schools in China, although this might reflect closure of schools during most of the outbreak.

We sought to include quantitative studies using diverse designs to model or empirically evaluate the effects of school closure and other school social distancing practices on infection rates and transmission during coronavirus outbreaks. Our search was designed to be inclusive of any studies providing data on schools or nurseries. We searched various electronic databases on March 9, 2020, and again on March 19, 2020, with no language restrictions. We searched PubMed using search terms and database-appropriate syntax: SARS [tw] OR “severe acute respiratory syndrome”[mh] OR “severe acute respiratory syndrome” OR “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus”[mh] OR “middle east respiratory syndrome*”[tw] OR “MERS-CoV”[tw] OR Mers[tw] OR “Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome*”[tw] OR “MERSCoV*”[tw] OR coronavirus[mh] OR Coronavirus Infections[mh] OR coronavirus*[tw] OR “COVID-19”[tw] or “2019-nCoV”[tw] or “SARS-CoV-2”[tw]) AND (Schools[mh:noexp] OR schools, nursery[mh] OR “Child Day Care Centers”[mh] OR “Nurseries, Infant”[mh] OR school[tiab] OR schools[tiab] OR preschools[tiab] OR preschool[tiab] OR “pre school”[tiab] OR “pre schools”[tiab] OR nursery[tiab] OR nurseries[tiab] OR kindergarten[tiab] OR kindergarten[tiab] OR “day care” OR daycare AND child* OR infant*. We searched the WHO Global Research Database on COVID-19 using the term “school”, which only retrieved one article that we excluded as it did not contain research. Therefore, we searched again using the search terms “child”, “children”, “childhood”, “infant”, “baby”, “babies”, “pediatric”, and “paediatric”. We also searched the preprint server medRxiv for all papers using the search terms “SARS or MERS or coronavirus or COVID-19”. We did not find it useful to include search terms relating to schools as the search facilities were not sophisticated. All articles were triple screened (by SJR, HC, and JP) on title and abstract. We excluded opinion pieces, systematic reviews, studies addressing other viruses, university-specific settings, epidemiological studies not examining intervention effects (eg, of prevalence of infection in schools), and studies in other languages with no English translation. All full-text articles identified were reviewed by RMV. For each retrieved full-text article, we hand searched included references and examined the citation chain for additional studies. We did not attempt to rate the quality of included studies in this Review. We considered findings from preprint articles separately to published peer-reviewed articles. The PubMed search identified 119 articles, of which 22 full-text articles were assessed and eight included in the Review. Searching the WHO Global Research Database on COVID-19 did not return relevant articles.

Imperial College,        London2020Google Scholar modelled the estimated effects of a range of different social distancing measures and combinations of measures. They used UK population and schools data together with data on transmission dynamics reported from the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Using data from previous influenza outbreaks, they assumed that per-capita contacts within schools were double those in households, workplaces, or the community, and that, overall, approximately a third of transmission occurred in schools. They modelled a scenario in which all schools and 25% of universities were closed and where the effect on non-school social contacts was an increase of 50% in household contact rates for families with children and a 25% increase in community contacts during the closure. They concluded that school closure as an isolated measure was predicted to reduce total deaths by around 2–4% during a COVID-19 outbreak in the UK, whereas single measures such as case isolation would be more effective, and a combination of measures would be the most effective. The authors concluded that school closure is predicted to be insufficient to mitigate (never mind suppress) the COVID-19 pandemic in isolation, which is in contrast to seasonal influenza epidemics where children are the key drivers of transmission.31Ferguson NM Laydon D Nedjati-Gilani G et al.Report 9: impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand. Imperial College,        London2020Google Scholar An early modelling study of a SARS-like illness in school children concluded that a school closure policy would reduce the effective R by 12–41% depending on the proportion of between-household mixing that occurred during school hours.

We were able to include only nine published studies and seven non-peer-reviewed studies. We decided to include unreviewed studies as data would not otherwise be available on COVID-19, although findings were interpreted with caution. Except for one modelling study, none of the included studies were designed to specifically examine the effectiveness of school distancing measures. Thus, data provided on the effect of school measures were of relatively low quality. We identified a remarkable dearth of policy-relevant data on the implementation of school social distancing during coronavirus outbreaks. This finding is perhaps not surprising for the rapidly emerging COVID-19 pandemic, but previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and MERS provide limited information about the effectiveness of school closures and no data on cost-effectiveness. No data on other less disruptive school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks were identified. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school transmission played no substantial role in the outbreak, and that school closures and other activities such as school temperature monitoring did not contribute to control of infection transmission. It is possible that these findings reflect an effect of school closures in rapidly stopping transmission; however, this is unlikely as schools remained open for prolonged periods during the early part of the outbreak. Modelling studies from the SARS outbreak produced different results. Although Becker and colleagues39Becker NG Glass K Li Z Aldis GK Controlling emerging infectious diseases like SARS.Math Biosci. 2005; 193: 205-221CrossrefPubMedScopus (31)Google Scholar estimated that school closure resulted in potentially important reductions in transmission, Liao and colleagues38Liao CM Chang CF Liang HM A probabilistic transmission dynamic model to assess indoor airborne infection risks.Risk Anal. 2005; 25: 1097-1107CrossrefPubMedScopus (43)Google Scholar estimated that transmission in school classrooms was low. School closures were rapidly deployed across mainland China and Hong Kong in early 2020 as part of a wider set of control measures for COVID-19, with the result that no data were available on the comparative effectiveness of school closure interventions in isolation.

However, they provide no data to support this assertion and indeed it might be very difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of school closures. Modelling studies from the COVID-19 pandemic support the use of national school closure as part of a package of social distancing measures. Yet, the only study to examine school closures as a separate intervention warned that the impact was relatively marginal, given the reasonable assumptions that household and community contacts would rise as a consequence. There are few data available from the literature on coronavirus outbreaks to guide countries on the use of school closures or other school social distancing practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Available evidence is consistent with a broad range of impacts of school closures, from little effect on reducing transmission through to more substantial effects. Yet, the economic costs and potential harms of school closure are undoubtedly very high. As evidence from coronavirus outbreak control is scarce, we must turn to evidence for the benefits of school closures from influenza epidemics and pandemics. School closures have been widespread in some countries during influenza pandemics, and many studies report important effects on reducing transmission and the size of the pandemic. Yet, there is considerable heterogeneity in the impact of school closures on transmission depending on characteristics of influenza serotype transmission. Systematic reviews of influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility (R<2), particularly if attack rates and transmission are higher in children than in adults.8Jackson C Mangtani P Vynnycky E Impact of school closures on an influenza pandemic: scientific evidence base review. Public Health England,        London2014Google Scholar Although our information on SARS-CoV-2 remains incomplete, this appears not to be the case with COVID-19 outbreaks.

Notably, analyses using UK clinical data from the 1957 Asian influenza pandemic suggest that school closures would reduce the epidemic size by less than 10% when the R was similar to that of COVID-19 (ie, 2·5–3·5).48Vynnycky E Edmunds WJ Analyses of the 1957 (Asian) influenza pandemic in the United Kingdom and the impact of school closures.Epidemiol Infect. 2008; 136: 166-179CrossrefPubMedScopus (71)Google Scholar Reviews also note that the benefits of school closure might be less than what have been assumed or modelled, as social contacts between children and between children and adults continue as part of informal childcare and non-school gatherings of children and young people.11Rashid H Ridda I King C et al.Evidence compendium and advice on social distancing and other related measures for response to an influenza pandemic.Paediatr Respir Rev. 2015; 16: 119-126CrossrefPubMedScopus (10)Google Scholar This conclusion is a particular concern for COVID-19, with its higher mortality among older people, as around 40% of the UK's grandparents provide regular childcare for their grandchildren.49Age UK 5 million grandparents take on childcare responsibilities.https://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-news/articles/2017/september/five-million-grandparents-take-on-childcare-responsibilities/Date: 2017Date accessed: March 13, 2020Google Scholar The WHO Director-General noted on March 12, 2020, that “all countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights”.1WHOWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the Mission briefing on COVID-19.https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19Date: 2020Date accessed: March 12, 2020Google Scholar Currently, the evidence to support national closure of schools to combat COVID-19 is very weak and data from influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures could have relatively small effects on a virus with COVID-19's high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on school children. At the same time, these data also show that school closures can have profound economic and social consequences. More research is urgently needed on the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices to inform policies related to COVID-19. We also need more detailed knowledge about how COVID-19 affects children and young people, as the role of school measures in reducing COVID-19 transmission depends on the susceptibility of children to infection and their infectiousness once infected.12Cowling BJ Ali ST Ng TWY et al.Impact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 and influenza in Hong Kong: an observational study.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 16.) (preprint).DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.12.20034660Google Scholar However, observational studies might be uninformative if closures are national and implemented at the same time as other mitigation measures. Better learning might come from countries that have instituted later or subnational closures. Modelling studies—particularly those parameterised for COVID-19 in children, and those that can consider interaction with other contextual factors (eg, timing, parents working from home, and additional social mixing as a consequence of school closures) or different strategies (national vs staged roll out)—are likely to be more informative and are urgently needed. These findings pose a dilemma for policy makers seeking measures to protect populations. School closure presents an apparently common-sense method of dramatically reducing spread of disease and the evidence from previous influenza outbreaks appears compelling. However, policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when proposing or implementing national or regional school closures for COVID-19, given the very high costs of lengthy school closures during pandemics. Decisions about closures and their timing and length involve a series of trade-offs between conflicting factors, and a substantial loss of health-care staff to childcare duties during closures might substantially reduce any benefit to health systems and populations brought by closures of schools.50House T Baguelin M Van Hoek AJ et al.Modelling the impact of local reactive school closures on critical care provision during an influenza pandemic.Proc Biol Sci. 2011; 278: 2753-2760CrossrefPubMedScopus (37)Google Scholar Nonetheless, in a context of high rates of staff absence through disease, school systems will be under strain and schools remaining open only for the children of health-care and other essential workers might be a better strategy than a haphazard process of schools closing and therefore providing no childcare for any essential workers. The scale and speed of school closures are unprecedented globally. It is unclear how long countries can maintain tight suppression measures before behavioural fatigue in the population occurs.31Ferguson NM Laydon D Nedjati-Gilani G et al.Report 9: impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand. Imperial College,        London2020Google Scholar Given predictions that social distancing measures might need to be in place for many months or even years,31Ferguson NM Laydon D Nedjati-Gilani G et al.Report 9: impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand. Imperial College,        London2020Google Scholar there is an urgent need to identify how countries can safely return students to education and parents to work. Education is one of the strongest predictors of the health and the wealth of a country's future workers, and the impact of long-term school closure on educational outcomes, future earnings, the health of young people, and future national productivity has not been quantified. Once the number of COVID-19 cases begin to fall, the measures used to achieve suppression might evolve over time. Schools have begun to reopen in parts of China,2United Nations EducationalScientific and Cultural OrganizationCOVID-19 educational disruption and response.https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closuresDate: 2020Date accessed: March 19, 2020Google Scholar and it will be essential for studies to monitor the effect of the reopening of schools on the numbers of COVID-19 cases. Examining countries that have not implemented school closures will also be important. Taiwan reopened schools in late February, 2020, relatively early in the outbreak; it has not yet initiated further large-scale closures but has been recognised to have effectively minimised spread of COVID-19. Policy makers and researchers should also look to other school social distancing interventions that are much less disruptive than full school closure and might substantially contribute to maintaining the control of this pandemic. Although strong evidence is not available for the effectiveness of these practices, they might be implementable with much less disruption, financial costs, or harms. Modelling and observational studies are urgently needed to guide policy on the opening of schools once the pandemic is under control. Contributors RMV conceptualised the paper, reviewed full-text articles, extracted the data, and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.

Multiple countries are now experiencing the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic; thus, gaining an understanding of how these interventions prevented the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in China is urgent. In The Lancet, Kathy Leung and colleagues2Leung K Wu J T Liu D Leung GM First-wave COVID-19 transmissibility and severity in China outside Hubei after control measures, and second-wave scenario planning: a modelling impact assessment.Lancet. 2020;  (published online April 8.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30746-7Google Scholar report their assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in four cities and ten provinces in China outside Hubei. The study estimated the instantaneous reproduction number in the selected locations decreased substantially after non-pharmaceutical control measures were implemented on Jan 23, 2020, and has since remained lower than 1. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in these locations was mainly driven by imported cases from Hubei until late January, which is, to some extent, similar to the transmission in January in several countries. The epidemics in Chinese provinces outside Hubei were believed to be driven by local transmission dynamics after Jan 31;3Kraemer M Yang CH Gutierrez B et al.The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China.Science. 2020;  (published online March 25.)DOI:10.1126/science.abb4218Google Scholar therefore, the findings of Leung and colleagues' study highlight the fact that the package of non-pharmaceutical interventions in China has the ability to contain transmission—not only imported cases, but also local transmission. The epidemic is accelerating rapidly in multiple countries, indicating shortfalls in preparedness. Given that multiple countries imposed travel restrictions against China in late January, there is a need to model whether earlier implementation of interventions such as social distancing, population behavioural change, and contact tracing would have been able to contain or mitigate the epidemic. Leung and colleagues also modelled the potential adverse consequences of premature relaxation of interventions, and found that such a decision might lead to transmissibility exceeding 1 again—ie, a second wave of infections. The finding is critical to governments globally, because it warns against premature relaxation of strict interventions. However, the effect of each intervention, or which one was the most effective in containing the spread of the virus, was not addressed in the study. While interventions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are in place, countries will need to work toward returning to normalcy; thus, knowledge of the effect of each intervention is urgently required. Air travel data were used to model the effect of travel restrictions on delaying overall epidemic progression, and were found to have a marked effect at the international scale, but only a 3–5 day delay within China.4Chinazzi M Davis JT Ajelli M et al.The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.Science. 2020;  (published online March 6.)DOI:10.1126/science.aba9757Google Scholar A study5Prem K Liu Y Russell TW et al.The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study.Lancet Public Health. 2020;  (published online March 25.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30073-6Google Scholar focused on the effects of extending or relaxing physical distancing control measures in Wuhan has suggested that if the measures are gradually relaxed in March, a second wave of cases might occur in the northern hemisphere mid-summer. Country-specific models of the effects of travel restrictions and social distancing, as well as the alternative strategies after the relaxation of these interventions, such as the use of face masks, temperature checks, and contact tracing, are now needed. Case fatality rate (CFR) is one of the important unknowns of COVID-19. Leung and colleagues estimated the confirmed CFR (cCFR) outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·82–1·16), which was consistent with the report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.6China CDC WeeklyThe Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team. The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19)—China.http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51Date: 2020Date accessed: March 30, 2020Google Scholar Since the epidemics in the studied locations did not overwhelm the health-care capacities, the data on the number of confirmed cases are believed to be reliable. Leung and colleagues also found the cCFR was correlated with provincial per capita gross domestic product and the availability of hospital beds per 10 000. In Wuhan, the CFR was up to 5·08% by March 28, 2020.7Wuhan Municipal Health CommissionReport of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in China (in Chinese).http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020032910315Date: March 29, 2020Date accessed: March 30, 2020Google Scholar The remarkable difference in the CFRa between these locations and Wuhan might be attributed to the difference in the degrees of health-care capacity. Therefore, consideration should be given to the variations in health-care capacity when implementing interventions. While the epidemic is growing exponentially, the health-care system will face severe burdens. Governments should act and prepare immediately to ensure that the health-care system has adequate labour, resources, and facilities to minimise the mortality risk of COVID-19.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.MethodsWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.FindingsThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.Interpretation2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.

Special-pathogen-free human airway epithelial (HAE) cells were used for virus isolation. Briefly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids or throat swabs from the patients were inoculated into the HAE cells through the apical surfaces. HAE cells were maintained in an air–liquid interface incubated at 37°C. The cells were monitored daily for cytopathic effects by light microscopy and the cell supernatants were collected for use in quantitative RT-PCR assays. After three passages, apical samples were collected for sequencing. All collected samples were sent to BGI for sequencing. 140 μL bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples (WH01 to WH04) were reserved for RNA extraction using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (52904; Qiagen, Heiden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A probe-captured technique was used to remove human nucleic acid. The remaining RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA, followed by the second-strand synthesis. Using the synthetic double-stranded DNA, a DNA library was constructed through DNA-fragmentation, end-repair, adaptor-ligation, and PCR amplification. The constructed library was qualified with an Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher, Foster City, CA, USA), and the qualified double-stranded DNA library was transformed into a single-stranded circular DNA library through DNA-denaturation and circularisation. DNA nanoballs were generated from single-stranded circular DNA by rolling circle amplification, then qualified with Qubit 2.0 and loaded onto the flow cell and sequenced with PE100 on the DNBSEQ-T7 platform (MGI, Shenzhen, China). After removing adapter, low-quality, and low-complexity reads, high-quality genome sequencing data were generated.

Primers were designed with use of OLIGO Primer Analysis Software version 6.44 on the basis of the assembled partial genome, and were verified by Primer-Blast (for more details on primer sequencs used please contact the corresponding author). PCR was set up as follows: 4·5 μL of 10X buffer, 4 μL of dNTP mix (2·5 μmol/L), 1 μL of each primer (10 μmol/L), and 0·75 units of HS Ex Taq (Takara Biomedical Technology, Beijing, China), in a total volume of 30 μL. The cDNAs reverse transcribed from clinical samples were used as templates, and random primers were used. The following program was run on the thermocycler: 95°C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min as determined by product size; 72°C for 7 min; and a 4°C hold. Finally, the PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and products of the expected size were sequenced from both ends on the Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyzer platform (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA; for more details on expected size please contact the corresponding author). The whole-genome sequences of 2019-nCoV from six samples (WH19001, WH19005, WH19002, WH19004, WH19008, and YS8011) were generated by a combination Sanger, Illumina, and Oxford nanopore sequencing. First, viral RNAs were extracted directly from clinical samples with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and then used to synthesise cDNA with the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and N6 random primers, followed by second-strand synthesis with DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (ThermoFisher). Viral cDNA libraries were prepared with use of the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), then purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), followed by quantification with an Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. The resulting DNA libraries were sequenced on either the MiSeq or iSeq platforms (Illumina) using a 300-cycle reagent kit. About 1·2–5 GB of data were obtained for each sample. The raw fastQ files for each virus sample were filtered using previously described criteria,18Pan M Gao R Lv Q et al.Human infection with a novel, highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N6) virus: virological and clinical findings.J Infect. 2016; 72: 52-59SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (94)Google Scholar then subjected to de novo assembly with the CLCBio software version 11.0.1. Mapped assemblies were also done using the bat-derived SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 (accession number MG772933.1) as a reference. Variant calling, genome alignments, and sequence illustrations were generated with CLCBio software, and the assembled genome sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was done to obtain the sequences of the 5′ and 3′ termini, using the Invitrogen 5′ RACE System and 3′ RACE System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-specific primers (appendix p 1) for 5′ and 3′ RACE PCR amplification were designed to obtain a fragment of approximately 400–500 bp for the two regions. Purified PCR products were cloned into the pMD18-T Simple Vector (TaKaRa, Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) and chemically competent Escherichia coli (DH5α cells; TaKaRa), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were sequenced with use of M13 forward and reverse primers. Reference virus genomes were obtained from GenBank using Blastn with 2019-nCoV as a query. The open reading frames of the verified genome sequences were predicted using Geneious (version 11.1.5) and annotated using the Conserved Domain Database.19Marchler-Bauer A Bo Y Han L et al.CDD/SPARCLE: functional classification of proteins via subfamily domain architectures.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: D200-D203CrossrefPubMedScopus (800)Google Scholar Pairwise sequence identities were also calculated using Geneious.

On the basis of the genome sequences obtained, a real-time PCR detection assay was developed. PCR primers and probes were designed using Applied Biosystems Primer Express Software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA) on the basis of our sequenced virus genomes. The specific primers and probe set (labelled with the reporter 6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM] and the quencher Black Hole Quencher 1 [BHQ1]) for orf1a were as follows: forward primer 5′-AGAAGATTGGTTAGATGATGATAGT-3′; reverse primer 5′-TTCCATCTCTAATTGAGGTTGAACC-3′; and probe 5′-FAM-TCCTCACTGCCGTCTTGTTGACCA-BHQ1-3′. The human GAPDH gene was used as an internal control (forward primer 5′-TCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAGG-3′; reverse primer 5′-CAGCGTCAAAGGTGGAGGAGT-3′; probe 5′-VIC-CCTCAAGGGCATCCTGGGCTACACT-BHQ1-3′). Primers and probes were synthesised by BGI (Beijing, China). RT-PCR was done with an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (ThermoScientific), with 30 μL reaction volumes consisting of 14 μL of diluted RNA, 15 μL of 2X Taqman One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents (4309169; Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher), 0·5 μL of 40X MultiScribe and RNase inhibitor mixture, 0·75 μL forward primer (10 μmol/L), 0·75 μL reverse primer (10 μmol/L), and 0·375 μL probe (10 μmol/L). Thermal cycling parameters were 30 min at 42°C, followed by 10 min at 95°C, and a subsequent 40 cycles of amplification (95°C for 15 s and 58°C for 45 s). Fluorescence was recorded during the 58°C phase. The funder of the study had no role in data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of report. GFG and WS had access to all the data in the study, and GFG, WS, WT, WC, and GW were responsible for the decision to submit for publication. From the nine patients' samples analysed, eight complete and two partial genome sequences of 2019-nCoV were obtained. These data have been deposited in the China National Microbiological Data Center (accession number NMDC10013002 and genome accession numbers NMDC60013002-01 to NMDC60013002-10) and the data from BGI have been deposited in the China National GeneBank (accession numbers CNA0007332–35). Based on these genomes, we developed a real-time PCR assay and tested the original clinical samples from the BGI (WH01, WH02, WH03, and WH04) again to determine their threshold cycle (Ct) values (table). The remaining samples were tested by a different real-time PCR assay developed by the Chinese CDC, with Ct values ranging from 22·85 to 32·41 (table). These results confirmed the presence of 2019-nCoV in the patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples or cultured viruses of nine patients were used for next-generation sequencing. After removing host (human) reads, de novo assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as queries to search the non-redundant protein database. Some contigs identified in all the samples were closely related to the bat SARS-like betacoronavirus bat-SL-CoVZC45 betacoronavirus.23Hu D Zhu C Ai L et al.Genomic characterization and infectivity of a novel SARS-like coronavirus in Chinese bats.Emerg Microbes Infect. 2018; 7: 154CrossrefPubMedScopus (13)Google Scholar Bat-SL-CoVZC45 was then used as the reference genome and reads from each pool were mapped to it, generating consensus sequences corresponding to all the pools. These consensus sequences were then used as new reference genomes. Eight complete genomes and two partial genomes (from samples WH19002 and WH02; table) were obtained. The de novo assembly of the clean reads from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs that corresponded to other viruses at high abundance. The eight complete genomes were nearly identical across the whole genome, with sequence identity above 99·98%, indicative of a very recent emergence into the human population (figure 1A). The largest nucleotide difference was four mutations. Notably, the sequence identity between the two virus genomes from the same patient (WH19001, from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and WH19005, from cell culture) was more than 99·99%, with 100% identity at the amino acid level. In addition, the partial genomes from samples WH02 and WH19002 also had nearly 100% identity to the complete genomes across the aligned gene regions.Figure 1Sequence comparison and genomic organisation of 2019-nCoVShow full caption(A) Sequence alignment of eight full-length genomes of 2019-nCoV, 29 829 base pairs in length, with a few nucleotides truncated at both ends of the genome.

A Blastn search of the complete genomes of 2019-nCoV revealed that the most closely related viruses available on GenBank were bat-SL-CoVZC45 (sequence identity 87·99%; query coverage 99%) and another SARS-like betacoronavirus of bat origin, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (accession number MG772934;23Hu D Zhu C Ai L et al.Genomic characterization and infectivity of a novel SARS-like coronavirus in Chinese bats.Emerg Microbes Infect. 2018; 7: 154CrossrefPubMedScopus (13)Google Scholar 87·23%; query coverage 98%). In five gene regions (E, M, 7, N, and 14), the sequence identities were greater than 90%, with the highest being 98·7% in the E gene (figure 2A). The S gene of 2019-nCoV exhibited the lowest sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, at only around 75%. In addition, the sequence identity in 1b (about 86%) was lower than that in 1a (about 90%; figure 2A). Most of the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and the related bat-derived coronaviruses (figure 2a). The notable exception was the spike protein, with only around 80% sequence identity, and protein 13, with 73·2% sequence identity. Notably, the 2019-nCoV strains were less genetically similar to SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). The similarity between 2019-nCoV and related viruses was visualised using SimPlot software, with the 2019-nCoV consensus sequence employed as the query (figure 2B).Figure 2Sequence identity between the consensus of 2019-nCoV and representative betacoronavirus genomesShow full caption(A) Sequence identities for 2019-nCoV compared with SARS-CoV GZ02 (accession number AY390556) and the bat SARS-like coronaviruses bat-SL-CoVZC45 (MG772933) and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (MG772934).

(B) Similarity between 2019-nCoV and related viruses. 2019-nCoV=2019 novel coronavirus. SARS-CoV=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Comparison of the predicted coding regions of 2019-nCoV showed that they possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and SARS-CoV (figure 1B). At least 12 coding regions were predicted, including 1ab, S, 3, E, M, 7, 8, 9, 10b, N, 13, and 14 (figure 1B). The lengths of most of the proteins encoded by 2019-nCoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 were similar, with only a few minor insertions or deletions. A notable difference was a longer spike protein encoded by 2019-nCoV compared with the bat SARS-like coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (figure 1B). Phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV and its closely related reference genomes, as well as representative betacoronaviruses, revealed that the five subgenera formed five well supported branches (figure 3). The subgenus Sarbecovirus could be classified into three well supported clades: two SARS-CoV-related strains from Rhinolophus sp from Bulgaria (accession number GU190215) and Kenya (KY352407) formed clade 1; the ten 2019-nCoV from Wuhan and the two bat-derived SARS-like strains from Zhoushan in eastern China (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) formed clade 2, which was notable for the long branch separating the human and bat viruses; and SARS-CoV strains from humans and many genetically similar SARS-like coronaviruses from bats collected from southwestern China formed clade 3, with bat-derived coronaviruses also falling in the basal positions (figure 3). In addition, 2019-nCoV was distinct from SARS-CoV in a phylogeny of the complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (appendix p 2). This evidence indicates that 2019-nCoV is a novel betacoronavirus from the subgenus Sarbecovirus.Figure 3Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes of 2019-nCoV and representative viruses of the genus BetacoronavirusShow full caption2019-nCoV=2019 novel coronavirus.

As the sequence similarity plot revealed changes in genetic distances among viruses across the 2019-nCoV genome, we did additional phylogenetic analyses of the major encoding regions of representative members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus. Consistent with the genome phylogeny, 2019-nCoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 clustered together in trees of the 1a and spike genes (appendix p 3). By contrast, 2019-nCoV did not cluster with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 in the 1b tree, but instead formed a distinct clade with SARS-CoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (appendix p 3), indicative of potential recombination events in 1b, although these probably occurred in the bat coronaviruses rather than 2019-nCoV. Phylogenetic analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome excluding 1b revealed similar evolutionary relationships as the full-length viral genome (appendix p 3).

Most of these positions in the C-terminal domain (figure 4). In addition, a number of deletion events, including positions 455–457, 463–464, and 485–497, were found in the bat-derived strains (figure 4).Figure 4Specific amino acid variations among the spike proteins of the subgenus sarbecovirusShow full captionViruses are ordered by the tree topology (as shown in figure 3) from top to bottom.

Through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses (appendix p 4), we found that, although 2019-nCoV was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 at the whole-genome level, the receptor-binding domain of 2019-nCoV fell within lineage B and was closer to that of SARS-CoV (figure 5A). The three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain was modelled using the Swiss-Model program33Waterhouse A Bertoni M Bienert S et al.SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: W296-W303CrossrefPubMedScopus (950)Google Scholar with the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8)34Prabakaran P Gan J Feng Y et al.Structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor-binding domain complexed with neutralizing antibody.J Biol Chem. 2006; 281: 15829-15836CrossrefPubMedScopus (70)Google Scholar as a template. This analysis suggested that, like other betacoronaviruses, the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain (figure 5B–D). Notably, the external subdomain of the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of SARS-CoV. This result suggests that 2019-nCoV might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor. However, we also observed that several key residues responsible for the binding of the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain to the ACE2 receptor were variable in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain (including Asn439, Asn501, Gln493, Gly485 and Phe486; 2019-nCoV numbering).Figure 5Phylogenetic analysis and homology modelling of the receptor-binding domain of the 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoVShow full caption(A) Phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain from various betacoronaviruses.

From genomic surveillance of clinical samples from patients with viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus (termed 2019-nCoV) has been identified.10Tan W Zhao X Ma X et al.A novel coronavirus genome identified in a cluster of pneumonia cases—Wuhan, China 2019–2020.China CDC Weekly. 2020; 2: 61-62Google Scholar,  11Zhu N Zhang D Wang W et al.A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online Jan 24.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2001017CrossrefPubMedScopus (535)Google Scholar Our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV, sequenced from nine patients' samples, showed that the virus belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. 2019-nCoV was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, than to known human-infecting coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003. Epidemiologically, eight of the nine patients in our study had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting that they might have been in close contact with the infection source at the market. However, one patient had never visited the market, although he had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness. This finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source. Evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission.12Chan JFW Yuan S Kok KH et al.A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster.Lancet. 2020;  (published online Jan 24)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFScopus (344)Google Scholar Clearly, this infection is a major public health concern, particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush, during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through China. As a typical RNA virus, the average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly 10−4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year,1Su S Wong G Shi W et al.Epidemiology, genetic recombination, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses.Trends Microbiol. 2016; 24: 490-502SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (156)Google Scholar with mutations arising during every replication cycle. It is, therefore, striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV from different patients described here were almost identical, with greater than 99·9% sequence identity. This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly. However, as the virus transmits to more individuals, constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that bat-derived coronaviruses fell within all five subgenera of the genus Betacoronavirus. Moreover, bat-derived coronaviruses fell in basal positions in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, with 2019-nCoV most closely related to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were also sampled from bats.23Hu D Zhu C Ai L et al.Genomic characterization and infectivity of a novel SARS-like coronavirus in Chinese bats.Emerg Microbes Infect. 2018; 7: 154CrossrefPubMedScopus (13)Google Scholar These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-nCoV in particular. However, despite the importance of bats, several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans. First, the outbreak was first reported in late December, 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%, which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV. Fourth, in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats acted as the natural reservoir, with another animal (masked palm civet for SARS-CoV35Guan Y Zheng BJ He YQ et al.Isolation and characterization of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus from animals in southern China.Science. 2003; 302: 276-278CrossrefPubMedScopus (1057)Google Scholar and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV)36Alagaili AN Briese T Mishra N et al.Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.mBio. 2014; 5: e00884-e00914CrossrefPubMedScopus (6)Google Scholar acting as an intermediate host, with humans as terminal hosts. Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market. Previous studies have uncovered several receptors that different coronaviruses bind to, such as ACE2 for SARS-CoV29Li F Li W Farzan M Harrison SC Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor.Science. 2005; 309: 1864-1868CrossrefPubMedScopus (354)Google Scholar and CD26 for MERS-CoV.30Lu G Hu Y Wang Q et al.Molecular basis of binding between novel human coronavirus MERS-CoV and its receptor CD26.Nature. 2013; 500: 227-231CrossrefPubMedScopus (258)Google Scholar Our molecular modelling showed structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV.

Our results suggest that recombination events are complex and are more likely occurring in bat coronaviruses than in 2019-nCoV. Hence, despite its occurrence, recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus, although this inference might change if more closely related animal viruses are identified. In conclusion, we have described the genomic structure of a seventh human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia and have shed light on its origin and receptor-binding properties. More generally, the disease outbreak linked to 2019-nCoV again highlights the hidden virus reservoir in wild animals and their potential to occasionally spill over into human populations.

Sophie Cousins reports. New Zealand recorded its first day of no new cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early this week, more than a month after its strict lockdown began. At the time of publication, New Zealand had recorded fewer than 1500 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 20 deaths. On March 23, a month after the country had recorded its first case, New Zealand committed to an elimination strategy. A few days later, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a strict national lockdown when it only had 102 cases and zero deaths. Her swift decision making won international praise, including from WHO. New Zealand's decision to pursue an elimination approach was a vastly different approach to usual pandemic planning, which has historically been based on a mitigation model and focuses on delaying the arrival of the virus, followed by a range of measures to flatten the curve of cases and deaths. Michael Baker, professor at the University of Otago's department of public health in Wellington, who has been advising the New Zealand Government on its response, said implementing a full lockdown—involving the closure of schools and non-essential workplaces, a ban on social gatherings, and severe travel restrictions—enabled the country to consider elimination. “I think it was the right decision; we had to go hard”, he said. “The two biggest benefits of pursuing an elimination strategy is that you have few cases and few deaths and you can get business back up and running. The alternative was that we are stuck with the virus and stuck between mitigation and suppression. Suppression is pretty grim.” While the strategy has had its critics, for Baker, the evidence was overwhelming that elimination could be achieved. Baker said the full lockdown allowed the country to get key systems up and running to effectively manage borders, and do contact tracing, testing, and surveillance. Since Jan 22, more than 150 000 people have been tested in a country of just 5 million. Testing has been focused on people with symptoms, with tracing of both close contacts and casual contacts. However, more widespread testing is now being introduced. The Ministry of Health is in discussion with districts to arrange testing of specific communities who are at higher risk of acquiring the virus such as those in aged residential care and health-care workers. Testing samples from sewerage is also being considered to monitor control and elimination. The response has also been one that placed science, leadership, and careful language at the forefront. Siouxsie Wiles, associate professor and head of the Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab at the University of Auckland, said one of the country's key successes has been the way in which COVID-19 was framed to the general population. “In other countries, people have been talking about war and battle, which puts people in a negative and fearful frame of mind”, she said. “The official response here has been guided by the principle that you do not stigmatise and that we unite against COVID-19.” Ardern has regularly appeared on social media, smiling and sharing parts of her personal life under lockdown but without underplaying the seriousness of the situation, which has helped to build public trust. Baker agreed that language was a crucial part of the response. He said that how the country communicates the concept of elimination will be important going forwards. Wiles agreed. “We don't want the public to feel like they are being lied to. Elimination to everyone means that it is gone. But in epidemiological terms, it means bringing cases down to zero or near zero in a geographical location. We will still see cases…but only cases in people who have arrived from overseas.” Travellers from abroad will be quarantined as part of efforts to prevent transmission in New Zealand. As New Zealand now eases its restrictions and its economy slowly reopens, there are discussions about how it can open up its borders while ensuring that everyone is protected, particularly susceptible populations. Australia, which is having similar success to New Zealand but is not publicly floating the idea of elimination, has been in discussion with its neighbour about reopening travel between the two countries. Baker envisions that, in time, a small number of countries in the region will reach an agreement to enable travel with specific control measures in place. Officials have pleaded for vigilance as breaches of the shutdown rules continue to rise. When the country loosened some of its restrictions last week, some fast-food outlets ran out of food as people flocked in huge numbers to get burgers and fries. “We are nearly there. We are not at the finish line yet”, Wiles said. “We won't see how successful we have been for a few weeks yet.”",2020-05-12 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Health and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong, China. Since the third week of January, 2020, massive public health interventions have been implemented across China to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; figure 1). Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, has been locked down since Jan 23, with 16 of its neighbouring cities in Hubei province included behind the cordon sanitaire shortly thereafter. The national Spring Festival holiday was extended by 8 days to Feb 7, and most schools have remained closed to date. As the Spring Festival holiday ended, stringent social distancing measures and mobility restrictions were coordinated and implemented by the central and local governments in many Chinese megacities (ie, the largest and wealthiest; figure 1), including Beijing (north of Wuhan), Guangzhou and Shenzhen (south), Shanghai and Hangzhou (east), and Chengdu (west). For example, only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down. Although the aggressive countermeasures appear to have reduced the number of reported cases, the absence of herd immunity against COVID-19 suggests that counts could easily resurge when these interventions are relaxed, as business, factory operations, and schools resume.Figure 1Timeline of events between Jan 23 and Feb 17, 2020Show full caption(A) The number of confirmed cases reported outside Hubei province in mainland China.

We have provided an assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 in mainland Chinese cities and provinces outside Wuhan and Hubei. We have estimated the instantaneous effective reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, as well as the ten provinces that have reported the highest number of confirmed cases outside Hubei; namely, Anhui, Chongqing, Guangdong, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang. Additionally, we have estimated the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR; the probability of dying among confirmed cases of COVID-19 as officially reported) in these same locations. The totality of massive social distancing and population behavioural change interventions has huge costs, in terms of both actual expenses and economic opportunity loss, in addition to having traded away individual freedoms and sustained severe societal disruptions.2The EconomistHow China's coronavirus epidemic could hurt the world economy.

On the other hand, COVID-19 has spread to more than 100 countries or regions, and local epidemics have been established in multiple countries, including the USA and most countries in Europe. On March 10, Italy, the worst-hit country outside China, with more than 10 000 cases, imposed a nationwide lockdown, which is expected to be in place until at least early April. Most countries in Europe have imposed stringent control measures to limit social contacts. As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, escalating case importation from overseas or residual infected seeds within China (despite the almost 2-month-long containment policy nationwide), coupled with the resumption of economic activities, a second wave of COVID-19 appears probable. Thus, we simulated the potential consequences of relaxing restrictions in anticipation of a recrudescence of infections. Research in contextEvidence before this studySince Jan 23, 2020, massive public health interventions have been implemented across China to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Wuhan has been locked down since Jan 23, 2020, with 16 of its neighbouring cities in Hubei province subsequently included behind the cordon sanitaire shortly thereafter. The national Spring Festival holiday was extended by 8 days to Feb 7, and, to date, most schools have remained closed. Although the aggressive countermeasures appear to have reduced the number of reported cases, the absence of herd immunity against COVID-19 suggests that case counts could easily resurge when these interventions are relaxed, as business, factory operations, and schools resume, given the increasing risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation. We searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published up to March 17, 2020, that contained information about the control measures against COVID-19 outbreak using the terms “coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, “COVID-19”, “control measures”, “outside Wuhan and/or Hubei”, and “Chinese New Year”. We found five studies that reported the estimates of the effects of control measures on COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan or Hubei, but no study focused on the regions outside Wuhan or Hubei.Added value of this studyIn regions outside Hubei, the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 substantially decreased after aggressive control measures were implemented on Jan 23, 2020, and have since remained below 1. Control measures should be relaxed gradually so that the resulting Rt would not sustainably exceed 1. Otherwise, the cumulative case count would increase exponentially with the relaxation duration. The confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) outside Hubei was 0·98%, but varied substantially among different provinces, probably due to heterogeneity in regional economic development and availability of health-care resources.Implications of all the available evidenceAlthough the first wave of COVID-19 in Chinese provinces outside Hubei has abated because of the aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave, given the increasing risk of viral reintroduction from overseas importation.

Implications of all the available evidence Although the first wave of COVID-19 in Chinese provinces outside Hubei has abated because of the aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave, given the increasing risk of viral reintroduction from overseas importation. The Rt was defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by one primary case with symptom onset on day t. If Rt >1 the epidemic is expanding at time t, whereas Rt < 1 indicates that the epidemic size is shrinking at time t. Therefore, we identified mainland Chinese cities that had published sufficiently detailed information of the COVID-19 cases confirmed by their local health commission that allowed for estimation of Rt—ie, daily number of new imported and local cases by onset date since mid-January, 2020. There were four such cities—Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou. As of Feb 29, 2020, there were 411 (Beijing), 337 (Shanghai), 417 (Shenzhen), and 504 (Wenzhou) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections reported.

We used the date when each case was reported on the website of local health commissions as the reporting date.

To estimate Rt of the ten provinces with the largest numbers of reported confirmed cases and cCFRs among officially confirmed cases for all provinces, we obtained the daily number of confirmed cases and deaths reported in all 31 provinces since Jan 22, 2020. We assumed that the cumulative density function of the time between onset and reporting (Fonset-to-reporting), and that between onset and death (Fonset-to-death), were both gamma (log-normal distribution was considered in the sensitivity analysis but gamma distribution gave a lower Bayesian information criterion). We estimated these distributions from the data in sources (5) and (6) using a Bayesian approach with non-informative priors in Markov chain Monte Carlo,11Gilks WR Richardson S Spiegelhalter D Markov chain Monte Carlo in practice. Chapman and Hall/CRC,        London1995Google Scholar implemented using MATLAB, version 2019b. We constructed the epidemic curves of the four cities. First, we plotted the (unadjusted) epidemic curves by date of onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and stratified by whether the cases reported travel history to Hubei (figure 2). Because the data of the time between onset and reporting were not available for the ten selected provinces, we assumed that such delay was statistically the same as that in Beijing, which was consistent with the time from onset to confirmation reported in the WHO–China Joint Mission Report.12WHOReport of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), 16–24 February, 2020.

The cCFR was estimated by the estimator: ∑i=0tdonset(i)∑i=0tnonset(i) The CI of cCFR was obtained using boot.ci function in the R package boot, version 1.3-24. We used the following susceptible–infectious–recovered model (appendix p 3) to assess the effect of relaxing non-pharmaceutical and social distancing interventions after the epidemic has been initially brought under control but not eliminated. Stage 1, interventions were implemented, such that Rt=1. Stage 2, interventions were relaxed, resulting in Rt=R2>1 when stage 2 began. Stage 3, interventions from stage 1 were again implemented, such that Rt=1. Stage 4, interventions more aggressive than those in stages 1 and 3 (when Rt=R4<1 when stage 4 began) were implemented to bring the disease prevalence back to pre-relaxation level (ie, stage 1 level). Let Ti be the duration of stage i and X the cumulative case count by the end of stage 4. We hypothesised that X increased exponentially with T2 (the duration of intervention relaxation)—ie, health loss; and T4 (the time required for the prevalence to reach pre-relaxation level during stage 4) was always larger than T2—ie, economic loss. We tested our hypothesis by examining the simulated values of X and T4/T2 for R2 at 2·5, 2, and 1·5 (the plausible ranges for COVID-1917Wu JT Leung K Leung GM Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 689-697Google Scholar,  18Kucharski AJ Russell TW Diamond C et al.Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online March 11.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30144-4Google Scholar) and R4 at 0·8, 0·5, 0·2, and 0·1, assuming that the mean generation time was 7 days.18Kucharski AJ Russell TW Diamond C et al.Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online March 11.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30144-4Google Scholar,  19Wu JT Leung K Bushman M et al.Estimating clinical severity of COVID-19 from the transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China.Nat Med. 2020;  (published online March 19.)DOI:10.1038/s41591-020-0822-7Google Scholar The simulation was done in MATLAB 2019b.

The inferred epidemic curves and the corresponding estimates of Rt on weekly windows between early or mid-January and late February, 2020, for Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou are shown in figure 2. The same data are shown for the ten selected provinces outside Hubei. In most provinces, the posterior mean of Rt gradually decreased from Jan 26 until Feb 7 (figure 3; appendix pp 1–2), which was the weekend before some enterprises and factories began to progressively resume operation on Feb 10 (figure 1), and coastal provinces such as Zhejiang and Guangdong started to have an increased influx of returning migrant workers. Rt remained lower than 1 for most provinces up to the week of Feb 19–25, except for Sichuan, which had a slower reduction in the number of reported cases than the other provinces. More detailed analysis of the four major cities suggested the transmission of COVID-19 was mainly driven by imported cases from Hubei until late January. The posterior mean of Rt was greater than 1 in mid-January in Wenzhou, and in late January in Shanghai. Rt decreased substantially in Shanghai from the first week of the Spring Festival (figure 1). As one of the cities that is not a provincial capital, but has the highest volume of mobility with Wuhan,17Wu JT Leung K Leung GM Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 689-697Google Scholar,  20Zhanwei D Lin W Simon C et al.Risk for transportation of 2019 novel coronavirus disease from Wuhan to other cities in China.Emerging Infect Dis J. 2020; 26: 5Google Scholar Wenzhou had the earliest imported cases, as expected. Symptom onset of its first imported case was as early as Dec 24, 2019. Wenzhou was also the first city outside Hubei to be locked down. Rt remained lower than 1 for both Beijing and Shenzhen, after discounting the large proportion of imported cases from Hubei, suggesting local transmission of COVID-19 has not been sustained, despite the early importation from Wuhan. The onset date of Shenzhen's first imported case was Jan 1; this case belonged to the first family cluster reported in Guangdong province.6Shenzhen Municipal Health CommissionConfirmed cases of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Shenzhen.http://wjw.sz.gov.cn/Date: 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar,  21Chan JF Yuan S Kok KH et al.A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster.Lancet. 2020; 395: 514-523Google Scholar In all four selected cities, the posterior mean of Rt decreased substantially, after massive control measures were implemented on Jan 23, and Rt remained lower than 1 after the Spring Festival holidays had ended. Although Beijing, Shanghai, and Wenzhou had few importations from Hubei during the Spring Festival, Shenzhen had a considerable proportion of imported cases from Hubei, even 2 weeks after Wuhan's lockdown. However, from Feb 7 onward, all four cities began to report imported cases from Hubei again, suggesting it might be a challenge to maintain subthreshold Rt when economic activities fully resume in the presence of exponentially increasing case importation from locations with ongoing community transmission of COVID-19 (eg, Hubei domestically, and Italy, South Korea, or Iran internationally). The cumulative number of importations from overseas increased from 20 to 353 between March 4 and March 22; most of these importations were reported by megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Containment measures based on isolation and contact tracing will eventually fail if case exportation continues to grow exponentially, which seems probable given that local transmission has already been established in many large countries, including the USA and most European countries. We estimated that cCFR among officially confirmed cases outside Hubei was 0·98% (0·82–1·16), ranging from 0·00% (0·00–0·58) in Jiangsu to 1·76% (1·11–2·65) in Henan among the ten provinces that reported the largest number of confirmed cases (figure 4). For reference, Hubei's cCFR was 5·91% (5·73–6·09). Given the intensive, proactive case finding and the sharp drop in reported cases outside Hubei during February, 2020, the ascertainment rates in these cities were probably very high. As such, we posit that cCFR in areas outside Hubei should be roughly comparable to the symptomatic CFR (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) in Wuhan (estimated to be 1·4% [0·9–2·1] in a separate analysis19Wu JT Leung K Bushman M et al.Estimating clinical severity of COVID-19 from the transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China.Nat Med. 2020;  (published online March 19.)DOI:10.1038/s41591-020-0822-7Google Scholar) after adjusting for the respective age distributions of the reported cases in the different cities and provinces (which was older in Hubei and therefore associated with higher COVID-19 fatality).Figure 4cCFRs in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou and in provinces outside HubeiShow full captioncCFR in Qinghai and Tibet were not shown because the 95% CIs were wide due to the small number of confirmed cases. cCFR=confirmed case-fatality risk.

Figure 5 indicates that relaxation of intervention increased the cumulative case count exponentially with the duration of relaxation, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push prevalence back to pre-relaxation level; and the required duration of such interventions would always be longer than the duration of intervention relaxation unless Rt was below 1·5 during intervention relaxation, and could be pushed below 0·5 during stage 4. Taken together, these results suggest that allowing Rt to rise above 1 when the epidemic size was still small (ie, no herd immunity) would likely incur both health and economic loss even if aggressive interventions could push the prevalence back to pre-relaxation level afterwards.Figure 5The effect of relaxation of interventions for different scenarios of reproduction numbersShow full captionR2 and R4 refer to the reproduction number when stage 2 and 4 began, respectively.

The findings from our modelling impact assessment suggest that the comprehensive package of non-pharmaceutical interventions China undertook, including social distancing and population behavioural change, has substantially reduced transmissibility of COVID-19 across the country. The daily number of local COVID-19 cases has dropped substantially to nearly zero in areas outside Hubei since late February; however, a second wave of COVID-19 transmission is possible because of viral reintroduction (particularly international importation—eg, from Italy or elsewhere in Europe, Iran, USA, and other rapidly burgeoning secondary epicentres22Centre for Systems Science Engineering at Johns HopkinsCoronavirus COVID-19 global cases by the Centre for Systems Science Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins.https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Date: 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar) that has been exponentially increasing since March, 2020, as well as viral transmissibility that might rebound with the gradual resumption of economic activities, and thus normal levels of social mixing. Close monitoring of the instantaneous effective reproduction number and real-time tuning of policy interventions to ensure a manageable second wave remains the over-riding public health priority. Early detection of cases is essential. Guangdong province did more than 320 000 RT-PCR tests on those who had attended fever clinics and hospitals over 30 days between January and February, 2020, which was about ten times baseline testing capacity for routine influenza-like illness surveillance during the influenza season of 2018.23Kang M Tan X Yang Y Wu J Zheng H Song T Epidemiological characteristics of influenza in Guangdong province, during winter of 2017–2018.Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2018; 39: 1071-1076Google Scholar Such a level of testing should be maintained, if not increased, to monitor the real-time point prevalence of COVID-19, so that any possible reintroduction of infected cases could be swiftly identified and isolated, and their contacts traced and quarantined. Our schematic scenario simulated how control measures could be tuned to minimise the total infected burden, thus corollary adverse health, and social and economic effects, by maintaining the effective reproduction number below the self-sustaining threshold of 1. Our results highlight that as the number of cases would progressively rise when Rt > 1, simply tightening control interventions again to maintain Rt=1 would not reduce the burden back to its original baseline. Once elevated at the higher level, it could only be pushed back down to the original baseline by extra effort, by driving Rt down below unity. Therefore, relaxation of interventions to allow Rt > 1 would probably incur both marginally higher health and economic loss, even if the disease prevalence could subsequently be pushed back to pre-relaxation level. Thus, proactively striking a balance between resuming economic activities and keeping Rt below 1 is likely to be the optimal strategy until effective vaccines become widely available, despite the fact that control policies, including social distancing, behavioural change, and public awareness, will probably be maintained for some time.24Chen H Xu W Paris C Reeson A Li X Social distance and SARS memory: impact on the public awareness of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 11.)DOI:10.1101/2020.03.11.20033688Google Scholar China could adopt a reinforcement learning approach to achieve such a delicate balance (namely, maximising economic productivity under the Rt ≤ 1 constraint) by continuous surveillance of the effect of social mixing and human mobility on the reproduction number of COVID-19 and then tune socioeconomic activities accordingly. In the conventional framework of inferring Rt from epidemic curve data (as we have done), the lead time between actual changes in Rt and the detection of such changes is roughly equal to the sum of the incubation period and reporting delay (although the latter could be adjusted for, as we have done). We postulate that such lead time might be shortened if reliable analytics could be developed to predict Rt from digital proxies for social mixing and human mobility. Specifically, the resumption of economic activities and normal societal functions can be digitally monitored in various ways by the cloud platforms of Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent.25China Academy of Information and Communications TechnologyResearch report of the application of data and intelligence in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.http://www.caict.ac.cn/kxyj/qwfb/ztbg/202003/P020200305495005485729.pdfDate: 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar As of March 10, the Alipay and WeChat Health Code system had been used more than 1·6 billion times, and its usage patterns reflect the level of economic activities in real time.26Mozur P Zhong R Krolik A In coronavirus fight, China gives citizens a color code, with red flags.The New York Times.

Using the intracity traffic volume on Jan 1–15 as the index, to date, the level of economic activities of the four selected cities have been at half the normal pre-outbreak levels. Closely monitoring Rt and such digital indices could enable finetuning of control measures to effectively minimise the potential adverse effects of a possible second wave of infections. Given the pivotal role of Rt in epidemic control, we suggest that real-time estimates of Rt should be presented in the routine COVID-19 dashboards and situation reports for provincial, national, and supranational health agencies. Keeping close watch of real-time transmissibility will also help to ensure the infection prevalence does not exceed the surge capacity of the health system. For example, even in the most prosperous and well resourced megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, with 5·7, 6·0, and 3·7 hospital beds per 1000 population, respectively, health-care resources are finite.27National Bureau of Statistics of ChinaNational data.http://data.stats.gov.cn/english/Date: 2020Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar If 20% of COVID-19 cases were to require hospital admission28The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology TeamThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19)—China.China CDC Weekly. 2020; 2: 113-122Google Scholar and infection prevalence was 0·5% at any single point in time, Shenzhen would be required to deploy 27% of its total number of hospital beds. The Chinese health-care system still relies heavily on secondary and tertiary care,29Meng Q Mills A Wang L Han Q What can we learn from China's health system reform?.BMJ. 2019; 365l2349Google Scholar,  30Li X Lu J Hu S et al.The primary health-care system in China.Lancet. 2017; 390: 2584-2594Google Scholar and hospitals overcrowded with patients with COVID-19 could displace care rendered to other patients who have non-COVID-19 health-care needs. This situation has already been observed in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei.31BloombergHospitals in China, overwhelmed by coronavirus, turn away patients with other pressing needs.Time. Feb 20, 2020; https://time.com/5788495/china-hospital-shortage/Date accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar We also found that fatality risks, among officially confirmed cases that are adjusted for resolution ascertainment bias, vary by several folds between provinces. The cCFR was relatively low in south and east China, and substantially higher in the north and northwest, which also correlates with provincial per capita gross domestic product (appendix pp 4, 11). Prosperous regions, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, had the lowest cCFRs among provinces that had more than 500 confirmed cases, whereas less developed regions, such as Henan, Hebei, and Heilongjiang, had the highest cCFRs. Guangdong, the richest province in the country, has the largest number of migrant workers in China and thus a high proportion of imported cases of COVID-19 from Hubei.12WHOReport of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), 16–24 February, 2020. World Health Organization,        Geneva2020https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdfDate accessed: March 17, 2020Google Scholar Guangdong's health-care system, with the second lowest number of hospital beds per 10 000 population, sustained an enormous stress to its surge capacity, which is perhaps reflected by its mid-level cCFR ranking. Similarly, for megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Shenzhen, the cCFRs ranked in the middle, despite their economic prosperity and relatively robust health-care infrastructure (appendix pp 5, 11). Although we did not have data on the proportion of hospital beds occupied during the first wave, given that there were fewer than 1000 confirmed cases in most cities and provinces (compared with approximately 123 600, 139 000, and 45 700 hospital beds overall in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, respectively), it was unlikely that the additional burden could have been overwhelming for the health systems outside Hubei. Several limitations should be noted. First, the estimation of Rt was based on the reported number of confirmed cases. Although there might be less under-reporting and ascertainment bias in provinces outside Hubei, our work shows the fundamental importance of a regularly (preferably daily) updated and sufficiently detailed line list. Second, the estimation of Rt relied on an accurate estimate of the serial interval distribution, where nearly half of the publicly available paired infector–infectee data points are currently derived from Shenzhen (appendix pp 7–9). Third, travel history or epidemiological links to Hubei were another essential element, because the proportion of imported cases varied over time and across locations. Although most cases in Wenzhou were local cases since Feb 4, the majority of confirmed cases in Shenzhen consisted mostly of imported cases from Hubei even up until Feb 12—more than 2 weeks after the Wuhan lockdown on Jan 23. Fourth, the simulations of intervention relaxation were done for a limited number of illustrative scenarios regarding temporal changes in the reproduction number. We did not attempt to relate which interventions and public responses to the epidemic might correspond to each of these scenarios. We found that at least 235 (56%) of 417 cases reported in Shenzhen were from clusters, among which more than 80% were household clusters. The proportion was even higher if we considered that some imported cases formed clusters with their close contacts in Hubei (although such information was missing in the Shenzhen line list). Further investigation of the transmission dynamics within households would require detailed data on household composition and demographics of household members,32Cauchemez S Donnelly CA Reed C et al.Household transmission of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus in the United States.N Engl J Med. 2009; 361: 2619-2627Google Scholar,  33Cauchemez S Fraser C Van Kerkhove MD et al.Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: quantification of the extent of the epidemic, surveillance biases, and transmissibility.Lancet Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 50-56Google Scholar,  34Cauchemez S Nouvellet P Cori A et al.Unraveling the drivers of MERS-CoV transmission.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2016; 113: 9081-9086Google Scholar importantly including healthy members who were not infected.21Chan JF Yuan S Kok KH et al.A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster.Lancet. 2020; 395: 514-523Google Scholar We found that Rt estimates were difficult to interpret if we included the two potential superspreading events in the prisons for the Rt estimation in Zhejiang and Shandong (figure 3; appendix pp 1–2). However, the number of superspreading events is increasing as COVID-19 spreads outside mainland China; for example, in places of worship in Hong Kong and Daegu of South Korea, in a mental health facility in Daegu, and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. A comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases in each superspreading event cluster will be essential to understand the transmission of superspreading events. Combining information on COVID-19 transmission in the superspreading events, households, and community would enable better understanding of the overall Rt estimates, which would further enhance the effectiveness of control measures, if they are accordingly and precisely designed. In conclusion, the interventions China implemented in response to the COVID-19 outbreak had a real and dramatic effect on interrupting transmission in all areas outside of Hubei. As economic activity continues to resume in the coming weeks, real-time assessment by monitoring the instantaneous effective reproduction number could allow policy makers to tune relaxation decisions to maintain transmissibility to below the self-sustaining threshold of 1. CFRs vary between provinces, which might be determined by health-care availability, quality, and surge capacity. Therefore, health services planning should be optimised to minimise mortality related to COVID-19. Contributors JTW, GML, and KL designed the experiments. DL and KL collected data.

As of April 22, India has reported 18 985 confirmed cases and 603 deaths from COVID-19 in 31 states and union territories since its first case on Jan 30. India was quick to close its international borders and enforce an immediate lockdown, which WHO praised as “tough and timely”. The lockdown has also given the government time to prepare for a possible surge in cases when the pandemic is forecasted to peak in the coming weeks. Still, India's population of 1·3 billion across diverse states, health inequalities, widening economic and social disparities, and distinct cultural values present unique challenges. Preparedness and response to COVID-19 have differed at the state level. Kerala has drawn on its experience with the Nipah virus in 2018 to use extensive testing, contact tracing, and community mobilisation to contain the virus and maintain a very low mortality rate. It has also set up thousands of temporary shelters for migrant workers. Odisha's exposure to previous natural disasters meant crisis precautions were already in place and have been repurposed. Maharashtra has used drones to monitor physical distancing during lockdown and applied a cluster containment strategy: if three or more patients are diagnosed, all houses within 3 km are surveyed to detect further cases, trace contacts, and raise awareness. Whether this strategy will be successful is still unclear. The premise relies on there not being community transmission, and there is danger of stigmatisation and coercion. But states deserve much of the credit for India's COVID-19 response. The government's sudden enforcement of the lockdown seemed hastily prepared and immediately disadvantaged already vulnerable populations. There has been a mass exodus of migrant workers and concerns are rising about starvation among people who work in the informal economy. Implementing public health measures is difficult in places with overcrowded living conditions and inadequate hygiene and sanitation. Non-COVID-19 health services have been disrupted. Reports suggest that the government's efforts to provide financial support and a measure of food security to ease these pressures will be insufficient to meet demand. But better planning and communication could have helped avert this crisis. Rates of testing have been low (0·28 per 1000 people as of April 20). Capacity issues, absence of political will, and operational feasibility have been to blame. However, efforts to reverse the situation are underway as hundreds of thousands of testing kits have become available, and more testing companies and laboratories have been approved. Testing needs to be expanded exponentially as well as strategically as a tool to provide epidemiological evidence. India's response has also been constrained by a shortage of health workers, but this should be remedied by new reforms that would mobilise additional health-care workers from different sources. One threat to the COVID-19 response in India is the spread of misinformation driven by fear, stigma, and blame. There have been rising levels of violence against health-care workers and stigmatisation of people with or suspected of having COVID-19, which could impede reporting of illness. The pandemic has also been used to fan anti-Muslim sentiment and violence, after a gathering connected to the group Tablighi Jamaat was identified as being responsible for many cases. A welcome initiative to combat fake news is being led by a group of more than 400 multidisciplinary Indian scientists, who have voluntarily formed Indian Scientists' Response to COVID-19 to fight myths and misinformation about the disease. In India's favour are its young population (65% aged <35 years) and, to date, a less severe pandemic than was feared. The lockdown is already having the desired effect of flattening the epidemic curve. From April 20, states began easing restrictions on the basis of district profiling of infection hotspots (a form of cluster containment). The immediate challenge is to keep infections at manageable levels and ensure the ability to test, trace contacts, isolate patients, implement COVID care plans, and disseminate timely information. The central government should loosen its control and give states more autonomy over their funding and decision making. India must also pay much greater attention to the health sector and recognise the importance of having strong public sector capacity, especially in primary care and at the district level. India's public health-care system is chronically underfunded (at just 1·28% of GDP), leaving primary care weak. This pandemic could be the much needed wake-up call to the necessity of long-term changes to India's health system.

Notably, the most frequent comorbidities reported in these three studies of patients with COVID-19 are often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; however, treatment was not assessed in either study. Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and SARS-CoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.4Wan Y Shang J Graham R Baric RS Li F Receptor recognition by novel coronavirus from Wuhan: An analysis based on decade-long structural studies of SARS.J Virology. 2020;  (published online Jan 29.)DOI:10.1128/JVI.00127-20CrossrefScopus (81)Google Scholar The expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs).4Wan Y Shang J Graham R Baric RS Li F Receptor recognition by novel coronavirus from Wuhan: An analysis based on decade-long structural studies of SARS.J Virology. 2020;  (published online Jan 29.)DOI:10.1128/JVI.00127-20CrossrefScopus (81)Google Scholar Hypertension is also treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which results in an upregulation of ACE2.5Li XC Zhang J Zhuo JL The vasoprotective axes of the renin-angiotensin system: physiological relevance and therapeutic implications in cardiovascular, hypertensive and kidney diseases.Pharmacol Res. 2017; 125: 21-38CrossrefPubMedScopus (23)Google Scholar ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19. If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, it could lead to a conflict regarding treatment because ACE2 reduces inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. A further aspect that should be investigated is the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, and hypertension, specifically in Asian populations. Summarising this information, the sensitivity of an individual might result from a combination of both therapy and ACE2 polymorphism. We suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Based on a PubMed search on Feb 28, 2020, we did not find any evidence to suggest that antihypertensive calcium channel blockers increased ACE2 expression or activity, therefore these could be a suitable alternative treatment in these patients.

If well tracked, early introductions of an emerging pathogen provide a unique opportunity to characterise its transmission, natural history, and the effectiveness of screening. Careful monitoring of cases and low probability of infection from the general community enables inferences, important to modelling the course of the outbreak, that are difficult to make during a widely disseminated epidemic. In particular, we can make assumptions about when and where cases were likely to have been infected that are impossible when the pathogen is widespread. Furthermore, during these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing important information about transmission and natural history. Combined, these data on early introductions can be used to give insights into the natural history of the disease,9Lessler J Reich NG Cummings DAT Nair HP Jordan HT Thompson N Outbreak of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) at a New York City school.N Engl J Med. 2009; 361: 2628-2636CrossrefPubMedScopus (227)Google Scholar transmission characteristics,10Lipsitch M Cohen T Cooper B et al.Transmission dynamics and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome.Science. 2003; 300: 1966-1970CrossrefPubMedScopus (652)Google Scholar and the unseen burden of infection.11Lessler J Salje H Van Kerkhove MD et al.Estimating the severity and subclinical burden of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Am J Epidemiol. 2016; 183: 657-663CrossrefPubMedScopus (19)Google Scholar Research in contextEvidence before this studyThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been accompanied by a substantial increase in research and publications ranging from transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 to clinical characteristics of the infection.

We present one of the first estimates of the serial interval, secondary household attack rate, and dispersion (ie, tendency towards super spreading) for SARS-CoV-2 based on active surveillance data. We found that the attack rate does not differ significantly by age, with on average 7% of close contacts becoming infected, around 80% of these contacts showing any symptoms, and 3% of infections manifesting severe disease at initial assessment. We also found that contact-based surveillance in Shenzhen reduced the duration an infected individual transmits in the community by 2 days.

We provide a key piece of evidence supporting intensive contact tracing and highlighting that children might be an important target for interventions aimed at reducing transmission, even if they do not get sick. Here, we use data collected by the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Shenzhen CDC) on 391 cases of COVID-19 and 1286 of their close contacts to characterise key aspects of its epidemiology outside of Hubei province. We characterise differences in demographics and severity between cases identified through symptom-based surveillance and monitoring of close case contacts, and estimate the time to key events, such as confirmation, isolation, and recovery. Using data from contact tracing, we characterise SARS-CoV-2 transmission by estimating key values, such as the household secondary attack rate, serial interval, and observed reproductive number (R). On Jan 8, 2020, Shenzhen CDC identified the first case of pneumonia with unknown cause and began monitoring travellers from Hubei province for symptoms of COVID-19. Over the next 2 weeks this surveillance programme expanded to include travellers from Hubei regardless of symptoms, patients at local hospitals, and individuals detected by fever screening in neighbourhoods and at local clinics. Suspected cases and close contacts were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of nasal swabs at 28 qualified local hospitals, ten district-level CDCs, and two third-party testing organisations, with final confirmation done at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangdong CDC) or Shenzhen CDC (appendix 2 p 11). Close contacts were identified through contact tracing of a confirmed case and were defined as those who lived in the same apartment, shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with an index case 2 days before symptom onset. Casual contacts (eg, other clinic patients) and some close contacts (eg, nurses) who wore a mask during exposure were not included in this group. Symptomatic cases were isolated and treated at designated hospitals regardless of RT-PCR test results. Asymptomatic individuals who tested positive were quarantined at centralised facilities. Close contacts and travellers from Hubei who tested negative were quarantined at home or a central facility, and monitored for 14 days. RT-PCR testing was required for all close contacts at the beginning of isolation, and release was conditional on a negative RT-PCR result. Basic demographics, signs and symptoms, clinical severity, and exposure history were recorded for all confirmed cases. Here, we analyse confirmed cases identified by the Shenzhen CDC between Jan 14 and Feb 12, 2020, and close contacts of cases confirmed before Feb 9, 2020. This work was done in support of an ongoing public health response, and hence was determined not to be human subjects research after consultation with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health institutional review board. Data collection is part of the continuing public health investigation of an emerging outbreak and therefore the individual informed consent was waived. The study was approved by the ethics committees of Shenzhen CDC. Analytical datasets were constructed in an anonymised manner, and all analysis of personally identifiable data took place onsite at the Shenzhen CDC. We defined symptom-based surveillance to include symptomatic screening at airport and train stations, community fever monitoring, home observation of recent travellers to Hubei, and testing of patients admitted to hospital. Contact-based surveillance is the identification of cases through monitoring and testing of close contacts of confirmed cases, independently of their symptom presentation. By protocol, those in the contact-based group were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of symptoms, whereas those in the other categories were tested only if they showed signs or symptoms of disease. At the first clinical assessment, data were recorded on 21 signs and symptoms (appendix 2 p 1), and disease severity was assessed. Cases with fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia were classified as having moderate symptoms. Cases were classified as having severe symptoms if they had any of the following: breathing rate 30 breaths per min or higher; oxygen saturation level 93% or lower at rest; oxygen concentration level PaO2/FiO2 (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen) 300 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0·133 kPa) or lower; lung infiltrates higher than 50% within 24–48 h; respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; septic shock; or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. All other symptomatic cases were classified as mild. Relationships between demographics, mode of detection, and symptom severity were assessed and characterised with χ2 tests, and simple and multiple logistic regression. Distributions were fit to the timing of key events in each confirmed case's course of infection and treatment. The time from infection to symptom onset (incubation period) was assumed to be log-normally distributed and estimated as previously described.12Reich NG Lessler J Azman A Kamvar ZN Analysis of coarsely observed data [R package coarseDataTools version 0·6–5].

Cases who recently travelled to Hubei were assumed to have been exposed while there. Cases without a recent travel history but with exposure to a confirmed case were assumed to be exposed from the time of earliest to latest possible contact with that case. Only cases for whom we could identify the earliest and latest possible time of exposure and who had a date of symptom onset were included in the analysis. Time between symptom onset and recovery was estimated by use of parametric survival methods. Patients who had not recovered were considered to be censored on Feb 22, 2020, or at the time of death. All other delay distributions were estimated by directly fitting parametric distributions to time between symptom onset or arrival in Shenzhen, and confirmation, isolation, or admission to hospital. Confidence intervals were calculated with bootstrapping or standard parametric estimators.15Efron B Gong G A leisurely look at the bootstrap, the jackknife, and cross-validation.Am Stat. 1983; 37: 36-48Google Scholar Transmission was characterised by examining the relationship between confirmed cases and their infected and uninfected close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was calculated as the percentage of household contacts (those sharing a room, apartment, or other sleeping arrangement) who were later confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The distribution of serial intervals (the time between symptom onset in the confirmed case and their infected contacts) was calculated by fitting parametric distributions to the time of symptom onset in clear case–contact pairs. The mean R and distribution of individual reproductive numbers (ie, the number of secondary infections caused by each case) were calculated from the number of secondary infections observed among close contacts of each index case, with ambiguities resolved through multiple imputation (appendix 2 p 11). The relative odds of transmission among contacts of various types were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression and random-effects models, to account for differing numbers of possible infected individuals in each risk group. When assessing the impact of characteristics of infected individuals, we only included risk sets where a single potential infected individual was clearly identifiable. Confidence intervals were estimated by use of bootstrapping or standard parametric approaches. The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Shenzhen CDC had full access to all the data in the study, and all corresponding authors share the final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Between Jan 14 and Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen CDC confirmed 391 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (table 1). Of 379 with a known mode of detection, 292 (77%) were detected through symptom-based surveillance. Overall, there were approximately equal numbers of male and female cases (187 vs 204). The mean age of the population was 45 years, and 307 (79%) of 391 cases were adults aged 30–69 years. At the time of first clinical assessment, most cases were mild (102 [26%] of 391) or moderate (254 [65%] of 391), and only 35 (9%) were severe. 330 (84%) of 391 cases had fever at the time of initial assessment, while 25 (6%) of 391 had no signs or symptoms. As of Feb 22, 2020, final clinical outcomes were known for 228 of 391 cases in our data, with three who had died (all captured through symptom-based surveillance) and 225 who had recovered.Table 1Demographic and clinical characteristics of cases by contact-based versus symptom-based surveillanceContact-based surveillance (n=87)Symptom-based surveillance (n=292)Unknown or other (n=12)Total (n=391)p valueSexFemale63 (72%)131 (45%)10 (83%)204 (52%)<0·0001Male24 (28%)161 (55%)2 (17%)187 (48%)..Age0–9 years13 (15%)6 (2%)1 (8%)20 (5%)<0·000110–19 years5 (6%)6 (2%)1 (8%)12 (3%)..20–29 years11 (13%)23 (8%)0 (0%)34 (9%)..30–39 years15 (17%)71 (24%)1 (8%)87 (22%)..40–49 years9 (10%)49 (17%)2 (17%)60 (15%)..50–59 years10 (12%)63 (22%)1 (8%)74 (19%)..60–69 years20 (23%)60 (21%)6 (50%)86 (22%)..≥70 years4 (5%)14 (5%)0 (0%)18 (5%)..SeverityMild18 (21%)82 (28%)2 (17%)102 (26%)0·03Moderate66 (76%)180 (62%)8 (67%)254 (65%)..Severe3 (3%)30 (10%)2 (17%)35 (9%)..SymptomaticNo17 (20%)8 (3%)0 (0%)25 (6%)<0·0001Yes70 (80%)284 (97%)12 (100%)366 (94%)..FeverNo25 (29%)34 (12%)2 (17%)61 (16%)0·0002Yes62 (71%)258 (88%)10 (83%)330 (84%)..

The probability of severe symptoms increased slightly with age, although only individuals aged 60–69 years had a significantly increased risk compared with the reference category, individuals aged 50–59 years (OR 3·4 [95% 1·4–9·5]). Based on 183 cases with a well defined period of exposure and symptom onset (appendix 2 p 8), we estimated the median incubation period for COVID-19 to be 4·8 days (95% CI 4·2–5·4; figure 1, appendix 2 p 2), and estimated that 95% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 14·0 days (95% CI 12·2–15·9) of infection. We estimated that about 5·0% of cases who develop symptoms would not show symptoms until 14 days after infection.Figure 1Incubation period and serial interval of COVID-19Show full caption(A) Proportion of cases who developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by days after infection (ie, the cumulative distribution function of the incubation period).

Based on 228 cases with known outcomes, we estimated that median time to recovery was 20·8 days (95% CI 20·1–21·5). We estimated that the median time to recovery was 22·4 days (95% CI 20·8–24·1) in individuals aged 50–59 years, and was estimated to be significantly shorter in younger adults (eg, 19·2 days in individuals aged 20–29 years; appendix 2 pp 3, 10). In multiple regression models including sex, age, baseline severity, and method of detection, in addition to age, baseline severity was associated with time to recovery (appendix 2 p 3). Compared to cases with mild symptoms, those with severe symptoms had a 41% (95% CI 24–60) longer time to recovery (appendix 2 p 3). As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died. These deaths occurred 35–44 days from symptom onset and 27–33 days from confirmation. Cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were confirmed on average 5·5 days (95% CI 5·0–5·9) after symptom onset (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2), whereas those detected by contact-based surveillance were confirmed on average 3·2 days (95% CI 2·7–3·8) after symptom onset. 17 (5%) of 342 cases with a known onset date and start date of quarantine were isolated before developing symptoms. Among those isolated after developing symptoms, the symptom-based surveillance group was, on average, isolated 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after symptom onset, whereas the contact-based surveillance group was isolated 2·7 days (2·1–3·3) after symptom onset. Hence, contact-based surveillance was associated with a 2·3-day (95% CI 1·5–3·0) decrease in time to confirmation and a 1·9-day (1·1–2·7) decrease in time to isolation. The mean time between symptom onset and admission to hospital was similar to time between symptom onset and isolation in both the symptom-based and contact-based surveillance groups (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2).Figure 2Time between symptom onset and SARS-CoV-2 confirmation (A), admission to hospital (B), and isolation among cases (C) detected by contact-based and symptom-based surveillanceShow full captionThe maximum-likelihood estimates for the parametric distribution of the cumulative distribution function are shown, along with 1000 parametric bootstrap estimates of the cumulative distribution function. Panel A shows estimates of the proportion of cases who are confirmed by RT-PCR, according to the number of days after symptom onset. We estimated that 50% of cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were confirmed by RT-PCR within 4·6 days (95% CI 4·2–5·0) after symptom onset, and 95% were confirmed by RT-PCR within 12·7 days (11·5–13·8) after symptom onset. Contact-based surveillance reduced the days from symptom onset to RT-PCR confirmation to 2·9 days (95% CI 2·4–3·4) in 50% of cases and to 6·6 days (5·3–8·0) in 95% of cases. Panel B shows estimates of the proportion of cases who were admitted to hospital, according to the number of days after symptom onset. We estimated that 50% of the cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were admitted to hospital by 3·4 days (95% CI 3·1–3·8) after symptom onset, and 95% by 12·4 days (10·9–13·8). Contact-based surveillance reduced the days from symptom onset to hospital admission to 2·1 days (95% CI 1·7–2·6) in 50% of cases, and 6·0 days (95% CI 4·5–7·5) in 95% of cases.

Contact-based surveillance reduced the days from symptom onset to RT-PCR confirmation to 2·9 days (95% CI 2·4–3·4) in 50% of cases and to 6·6 days (5·3–8·0) in 95% of cases. Panel B shows estimates of the proportion of cases who were admitted to hospital, according to the number of days after symptom onset. We estimated that 50% of the cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were admitted to hospital by 3·4 days (95% CI 3·1–3·8) after symptom onset, and 95% by 12·4 days (10·9–13·8). Contact-based surveillance reduced the days from symptom onset to hospital admission to 2·1 days (95% CI 1·7–2·6) in 50% of cases, and 6·0 days (95% CI 4·5–7·5) in 95% of cases. Panel C shows estimates of the proportion of cases isolated, according to number of days after symptom onset. We estimated that 50% of cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were isolated by 3·4 days (95% CI 3·1–3·7) after symptom onset, and 95% by 12·2 days (95% CI 10·8–13·6). Contact-based surveillance reduced the days from symptom onset to isolation to 2·2 days (95% CI 1·7–2·6) in 50% of cases, and to 6·5 days (4·7–8·2) in 95% of cases. 191 (64%) of 298 travellers developed symptoms after arriving in Shenzhen, with a mean time from arrival to symptom onset of 4·9 days (95% CI 4·2–5·5; appendix 2 p 2). Those developing symptoms before arrival or on the day of arrival were confirmed as cases on average 4·5 days (95% CI 3·8–5·1) after arrival, and isolated on average 3·1 days (2·5–3·7) after arrival. Overall, 1286 close contacts were identified for index cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 14 and Feb 9, 2020, with 244 (84%) of 292 cases having at least one close contact. 622 (95%) of 653 close contacts with known dates for the period when they were under quarantine were followed up for 12 days or longer. 98 of the close contacts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, and one had presumptive infection. Assuming those with a missing test result were uninfected, we found that the secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8) among household contacts and 6·6% (5·4–8·1) overall (the secondary attack rate increased to 14·9% [12·1–18·2] among household contacts and 9·7% [7·9–11·8] overall if those with missing results were removed from the denominator). In multiple conditional logistic regression analysis of contact types, household contact (OR 6·3; 95% CI 1·5–26·3) and travelling together (OR 7·1; 1·4–34·9) were significantly associated with infection (table 3). Reporting contact that occurred often was also associated with increased risk of infection compared with moderate-frequency contact (OR 8·8; 95% CI 2·6–30·1; table 3).Table 3Group-specific attack rates and risk factors for SAR-CoV-2 infection among close contactsNumber of cases** 15 confirmed close contacts were excluded from this analysis because contact tracing reports for the negative close contacts in the same clusters were missing.

Attack rates were similar across all age categories of infected contacts (table 3), although we observed some indication of elevated attack rates in older age groups (figure 3). Notably, the rate of infection in children younger than 10 years (7·4%) was similar to the population average (6·6%). There was no significant association between probability of infection and age of the index case. Surprisingly, in univariate analysis a longer time in the community before isolation was associated with a reduced risk of causing infections (data not shown). However, this association was no longer significant after adjusting for contact frequency and type.Figure 3Attack rate among close contacts, baseline severity, and proportion of cases without fever at initial assessment by age groupShow full caption*Proportion of close contacts for attack rate; proportion of all cases for those with severe symptoms or no fever at initial assessment.View Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) *Proportion of close contacts for attack rate; proportion of all cases for those with severe symptoms or no fever at initial assessment. Based on 48 pairs of cases with a clear relationship between the index case and secondary case and time of symptom onset, we estimated that the serial interval is gamma distributed with a mean of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6) and an SD of 4·2 days (95% CI 3·1–5·3; figure 1B, appendix 2 p 2). Hence, 95% of secondary cases were expected to develop symptoms within 14·3 days (95% CI 11·1–17·6) of their infector. This estimate includes the effect of isolation on truncating the serial interval. Stratified results show that if the infected individual was isolated less than 3 days after infection the average serial interval was 3·6 days, increasing to 8·1 days if the infected individual was isolated on the third day after symptom onset or later (appendix 2 p 3). The mean number of secondary cases caused by each index case (ie, the observed reproductive number, R), was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5). The distribution of individual R values was highly over-dispersed, with 80% of infections being caused by 8·9% (95% CI 3·5–10·8) of cases (negative binomial dispersion parameter 0·58; 95% CI 0·35–1·18). We examined the potential impact of surveillance and isolation through truncating the infectious period. Because of the scarce understanding of infectious periods following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we considered a range of possible infectious periods where infectiousness varies over time and follows a gamma distribution (appendix 2 p 11). We defined the mean infectious day (ie, the average number of days after symptom onset that an infected individual is expected to infect a secondary case) as the weighted mean of the infectious period, where each day is weighted by relative infectiousness. We considered periods where the mean infectious day is less than 15 days after symptom onset (roughly the period of SARS and early SARS-CoV-2 reports),16Peiris JSM Chu CM Cheng VCC et al.Clinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1767-1772SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (1025)Google Scholar,  17Zou L Ruan F Huang M et al.SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 1177-1179CrossrefPubMedScopus (129)Google Scholar and assumed that R0=2·6 and that isolation effectively ends the infectious period. Under these assumptions we found that if the mean infectious day is greater than 5 days, then it might be possible to bring R below one in cases detected by symptom-based surveillance, and the same can be accomplished by contact-based surveillance if the mean infectious day is greater than 3 days (appendix 2 p 9). For the impact of passive surveillance alone to achieve our observed R of 0·4, we projected that the mean infectious day must be at least 5·5 days (and likely greater) after symptom onset. Even if transmission is completely eliminated in the group captured by surveillance (eg, if we could get perfect surveillance on the day of symptom onset), assuming R0=2·6, the cases captured by surveillance must, if not isolated, be expected to cause 61% of onward transmission to achieve local elimination by surveillance and isolation alone (appendix 2 p 9). This analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 cases and their close contacts in Shenzhen, China, provides insight into the natural history, transmission, and control of this disease. The values estimated provide the evidentiary foundation for predicting the impact of this virus, evaluating control measures, and guiding the global response. Analyses of how cases are detected, and use of data on individuals exposed but not infected, indicate that infection rates in young children are not lower than the population average (even if rates of clinical disease are). We were able to directly estimate important transmission parameters, and show that, at least among observed contacts, transmission rates are low. Estimates of the distribution of time between symptom onset and case isolation by surveillance type reveal that heightened surveillance combined with case isolation could plausibly account for these low rates of transmission. These results paint a positive picture of the impact of heightened surveillance and isolation in Shenzhen. However, uncertainty in the number of asymptomatic cases missed by surveillance and their ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 must temper any hopes of stopping the COVID-19 pandemic by these measures. This work further supports the understanding of COVID-19 as a disease with a fairly short incubation period (mean 4–6 days) but a long clinical course,2Chen N Zhou M Dong X et al.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 507-513SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (559)Google Scholar,  7Backer JA Klinkenberg D Wallinga J Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20–28 January 2020.Euro Surveill. 2020; 252000062CrossrefScopus (49)Google Scholar,  18Pan F Ye T Sun P et al.Time course of lung changes on chest CT during recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia.Radiology. 2020;  (published online Feb 13.)DOI:10.1148/radiol.2020200370CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar with patients taking many weeks to die or recover. Notably, however, we estimate a higher proportion of cases taking 14 days or more to develop symptoms (5%) than estimated in the study by Lauer and colleagues (1%).6Lauer SA Grantz KH Bi Q et al.The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application.Ann Int Med. 2020;  (published online March 10)DOI: 10.7326/M20-0504CrossrefPubMedScopus (56)Google Scholar Focusing on cases detected through contact-based surveillance adds nuance to previous characterisations of COVID-19. Since RT-PCR testing of contacts is near universal, we can assume these cases are more reflective of the average SARS-CoV-2 infection than cases detected through symptomatic surveillance. In the contact-based surveillance group, any tendency for cases to be male or older (beyond the underlying population distribution) disappears. Furthermore, in this group, 20% of cases were asymptomatic at the time of first clinical assessment and nearly 30% did not have a fever. This observation is consistent with a reasonably high rate of asymptomatic carriage, but lower than that suggested by some modelling studies,19Imai N Cori A Dorigatti I Baguelin M Donnelly CA Riley S Ferguson NM Report 3: transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-transmissibility-25-01-2020.pdfDate: Jan 25, 2020Date accessed: February 24, 2020Google Scholar although RT-PCR has imperfect sensitivity.20Fang Y Zhang H Xie J et al.Sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19: comparison to RT-PCR.Radiology. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1148/radiol.2020200432CrossrefGoogle Scholar In Shenzhen, SARS-CoV-2 transmission most probably occurred between very close contacts, such as individuals sharing a household. However, even in this group fewer than one in six contacts (ie, secondary attack rate 11–15%) were infected, and overall we observed far fewer than one (0·4) onward transmission per primary case. As noted above, low transmission levels might in part be due to the impact of isolation and surveillance, but it is equally likely that unobserved transmission has some role. We also estimated reasonably high rates of overdispersion in the number of cases caused by each infected individual, leaving open the possibility that large COVID-19 clusters can occur even if surveillance and isolation are forcing R below one—events that could potentially overwhelm the surveillance system. This work has numerous limitations. As in any active outbreak response, the data were collected by multiple teams under protocols that, by necessity, changed as the situation developed. Hence, there might be noise and inconsistency in definitions. Notably, the definition of a confirmed case changed to require symptoms near the end of our analysis period (Feb 7), but sensitivity analyses show that truncating the data at this point does not qualitatively influence results (appendix 2 pp 5–6). It is, likewise, impossible to identify every potential contact an individual has, so contact tracing focuses on those close contacts who are most likely to be infected; hence our R is assuredly lower than the true reproductive number in the population. Asymptomatic travellers will be missed by symptom-based surveillance and, even if they are tested, some asymptomatic contacts might be missed because of the imperfect sensitivity of the RT-PCR test.20Fang Y Zhang H Xie J et al.Sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19: comparison to RT-PCR.Radiology. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1148/radiol.2020200432CrossrefGoogle Scholar Recovery time in Shenzhen is likely to be inflated because cases are required to be isolated for 2 weeks and release is conditional on a negative RT-PCR test. Although guidelines for contact tracing and case detection are supposed to be implemented across the country, whether the impact of contact tracing can be generalised to other parts of China depends on a range of factors, including local testing capacity and surveillance resources. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, it is important that we continue to expand our knowledge about its transmission and natural history. Data from the early phase of local outbreaks, when detailed contact tracing is possible and sources of infection can still be reliably inferred, are particularly powerful for estimating critical values pertinent to describing transmission and the natural history of a disease. This is especially true when information about uninfected contacts and mode of detection is used, as we have done here. The resulting estimates provide important inputs for interpreting surveillance data, evaluating interventions, and setting public health policy. This online publication has been corrected.

ID:126981,N/A,medical,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention","INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)This topic will discuss the virology, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19. The management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)Issues related to COVID-19 in specific populations are discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)VIROLOGY — Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus in the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (as well as several bat coronaviruses), but in a different clade. The structure of the receptor-binding gene region is very similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and the virus has been shown to use the same receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for cell entry [4]. The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has proposed that this virus be designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [5].The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, another betacoronavirus, appears more distantly related [6,7]. The closest RNA sequence similarity is to two bat coronaviruses, and it appears likely that bats are the primary source; whether COVID-19 virus is transmitted directly from bats or through some other mechanism (eg, through an intermediate host) is unknown [8]. (See ""Coronaviruses"", section on 'Viral serotypes'.)In a phylogenetic analysis of 103 strains of SARS-CoV-2 from China, two different types of SARS-CoV-2 were identified, designated type L (accounting for 70 percent of the strains) and type S (accounting for 30 percent) [9]. The L type predominated during the early days of the epidemic in China, but accounted for a lower proportion of strains outside of Wuhan than in Wuhan. The clinical implications of these findings are uncertain. EPIDEMIOLOGYGeographic distribution — Globally, more than four million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported. Updated case counts in English can be found on the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control websites. An interactive map highlighting confirmed cases throughout the world can be found here.Since the first reports of cases from Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China, at the end of 2019, more than 80,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported in China, with the majority of those from Hubei and surrounding provinces. A joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission estimated that the epidemic in China peaked between late January and early February 2020 [10], and the rate of new cases decreased substantially by early March. However, cases have been reported in all continents, except for Antarctica, and have been steadily rising around the world.In the United States, COVID-19 has been reported in all 50 states, Washington DC, and at least four territories [11]. The cumulative incidence varies by state and likely depends on a number of factors, including population density and demographics, extent of testing and reporting, and timing of mitigation strategies. In the United States, outbreaks in long-term care facilities and homeless shelters have emphasized the risk of exposure and infection in congregate settings [12-14]. (See 'Risk of transmission' below.)Transmission — Understanding of the transmission risk is incomplete. Epidemiologic investigation in Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak identified an initial association with a seafood market that sold live animals, where most patients had worked or visited and which was subsequently closed for disinfection [15]. However, as the outbreak progressed, person-to-person spread became the main mode of transmission. Person-to-personRoute of person-to-person transmission — The exact mode of person-to-person spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. It is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, resembling the spread of influenza. With droplet transmission, virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes; infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) and do not linger in the air. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the airborne route (through particles smaller than droplets that remain in the air over time and distance) under natural conditions has been a controversial issue. One letter to the editor described a study in which SARS-CoV-2 grown in tissue culture remained viable in experimentally generated aerosols for at least three hours [16]; some studies have identified viral RNA in ventilation systems and in air samples of hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19, but cultures for viable virus were not performed in these studies [17-19]. Other studies using high-speed imaging to visualize respiratory exhalations have suggested that respiratory droplets may get carried in a gas cloud and have horizontal trajectories beyond six feet (two meters) with speaking, coughing, or sneezing [20,21]. However, the direct relevance of these findings to the epidemiology of COVID-19 and their clinical implications are unclear. Long-range airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not clearly been documented [22], and in a few reports of health care workers exposed to patients with undiagnosed infection with only contact and droplet precautions, no secondary infections were identified despite the absence of airborne precautions [23,24]. Reflecting the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms, recommendations on airborne precautions in the health care setting vary by location; airborne precautions are universally recommended when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood, and ocular secretions, but the role of these sites in transmission is uncertain [25-29]. In particular, several reports have described detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stool specimens, even after viral RNA could no longer be detected from upper respiratory specimens [28,29], and live virus has been cultured from stool in rare cases [26]. Although it would be difficult to confirm, fecal-oral transmission has not been clinically described, and according to a joint WHO-China report, did not appear to be a significant factor in the spread of infection [30]. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood has also been reported in some but not all studies that have tested for it [25,26,29,31]. However, the likelihood of bloodborne transmission (eg, through blood products or needlesticks) appears low; respiratory viruses are generally not transmitted through the bloodborne route, and transfusion-transmitted infection has not been reported for SARS-CoV-2 or for the related MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV [32]. (See ""Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing"", section on 'Emerging infectious disease agents'.)Viral shedding and period of infectivity — The interval during which an individual with COVID-19 is infectious is uncertain. It appears that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted prior to the development of symptoms and throughout the course of illness. However, most data informing this issue are from studies evaluating viral RNA detection from respiratory and other specimens, and detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus. Viral RNA levels from upper respiratory specimens appear to be higher soon after symptom onset compared with later in the illness [33-37]. Additionally, in a study of nine patients with mild COVID-19, infectious virus was isolated from naso/oropharyngeal and sputum specimens during the first eight days of illness, but not after this interval, despite continued high viral RNA levels at these sites [35]. One modeling study, based on the timing of infection among 77 transmission pairs in China (with a mean serial interval of 5.8 days between the onset of symptoms in each pair) and assumptions about incubation period, suggested infectiousness started 2.3 days prior to symptom onset, peaked 0.7 days before symptom onset, and declined within seven days; however, most patients were isolated following symptom onset, which would reduce the risk of transmission later in illness regardless of infectiousness [36]. These findings raise the possibility that patients might be more infectious in the earlier stage of infection, but additional data are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Nevertheless, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or individuals within the incubation period) has been documented [38-42]. The biologic basis for this is supported by a study of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility, in which infectious virus was cultured from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive upper respiratory tract specimens in presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients as early as six days prior to the development of typical symptoms [43]. However, the extent to which asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission occurs and how much it contributes to the pandemic remain unknown. In an analysis of 157 locally acquired COVID-19 cases in Singapore, transmission during the incubation period was estimated to account for 6.4 percent; in such cases, the exposures occurred one to three days prior to symptom development [44]. Large-scale serologic screening may be able to provide a better sense of the scope of asymptomatic infections and inform epidemiologic analysis; several serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 are under development, and some have been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [45,46]. How long a person remains infectious is also uncertain. The duration of viral RNA shedding is variable; there appears to be a wide range, which may depend on severity of illness [29,35,47-49]. In one study of 21 patients with mild illness (no hypoxia), 90 percent had repeated negative viral RNA tests on nasopharyngeal swabs by 10 days after the onset of symptoms; tests were positive for longer in patients with more severe illness [47]. In contrast, in another study of 56 patients with mild to moderate illness (none required intensive care), the median duration of viral RNA shedding from naso- or oropharyngeal specimens was 24 days, and the longest was 42 days [50]. However, as mentioned above, detectable viral RNA does not always correlate with isolation of infectious virus, and there may be a threshold of viral RNA level below which infectivity is unlikely. In the study of nine patients with mild COVID-19 described above, infectious virus was not detected from respiratory specimens when the viral RNA level was <106 copies/mL [35]. According to information from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when patients continue to have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory samples following clinical recovery, by three days after recovery, the RNA concentrations are generally at or below the levels at which replication-competent virus can be reliably isolated; additionally, isolation of infectious virus from upper respiratory specimens more than nine days after illness onset has not yet been documented [51]. The impact of viral RNA detection on infection control precautions is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Risk of transmission — The risk of transmission from an individual with SARS-CoV-2 infection varies by the type and duration of exposure, use of preventive measures, and likely individual factors (eg, the amount of virus in respiratory secretions). Most secondary infections have been described among household contacts, in congregate or health care settings when personal protective equipment was not used (including hospitals [52] and long-term care facilities [12]), and in closed settings (eg, cruise ships [53]). However, reported clusters of cases after social or work gatherings also highlight the risk of transmission through close, non-household contact.Contact tracing in the early stages of epidemics at various locations suggested that most secondary infections were among household contacts, with a secondary attack rate of up to 16 percent [30,54-57]. According to a joint WHO-China report, the rate of secondary COVID-19 in various locations ranged from 1 to 5 percent among tens of thousands of close contacts of confirmed patients in China; most of these occurred within households, with an in-household secondary attack rate of 3 to 10 percent [30]. In the United States, the symptomatic secondary attack rate was 0.45 percent among 445 close contacts of 10 confirmed patients; among household members, the rate was 10.5 percent [54]. In a similar study in Korea, the rates were comparable, with secondary infections in 0.55 percent of all contacts and 7.6 percent of family members [55].Clusters of cases have also been reported following family, work, or social gatherings where close, personal contact can occur [58,59]. As an example, epidemiologic analysis of a cluster of cases in the state of Illinois showed probable transmission through two family gatherings at which communal food was consumed, embraces were shared, and extended face-to-face conversations were exchanged with symptomatic individuals who were later confirmed to have COVID-19 [58].The risk of transmission with more indirect contact (eg, passing someone with infection on the street, handling items that were previously handled by someone with infection) is not well established and is likely low. Environmental contamination — Virus present on contaminated surfaces may be another source of infection if susceptible individuals touch these surfaces and then transfer infectious virus to mucous membranes in the mouth, eyes, or nose. The frequency and relative importance of this type of transmission remain unclear. It may be more likely to be a potential source of infection in settings where there is heavy viral contamination (eg, in an infected individual's household or in health care settings). Extensive SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces in hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19 has been described [17,60]. In a study from Singapore, viral RNA was detected on nearly all surfaces tested (handles, light switches, bed and handrails, interior doors and windows, toilet bowl, sink basin) in the airborne infection isolation room of a patient with symptomatic mild COVID-19 prior to routine cleaning [17]. Viral RNA was not detected on similar surfaces in the rooms of two other symptomatic patients following routine cleaning (with sodium dichloroisocyanurate). Of note, viral RNA detection does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus [35]. It is unknown how long SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces [16,61,62]; other coronaviruses have been tested and may survive on inanimate surfaces for up to six to nine days without disinfection. In a study evaluating the survival of viruses dried on a plastic surface at room temperature, a specimen containing SARS-CoV (a virus closely related to SARS-CoV-2) had detectable infectivity at six but not nine days [62]. However, in a systematic review of similar studies, various disinfectants (including ethanol at concentrations between 62 and 71%) inactivated a number of coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 within one minute [61]. Based on data concerning other coronaviruses, duration of viral persistence on surfaces also likely depends on the ambient temperature, relative humidity, and the size of the initial inoculum [63].These data highlight the importance of environmental disinfection in the home and health care setting. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Environmental disinfection'.)Uncertain risk of animal contact — SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to have originally been transmitted to humans from an animal host, but the ongoing risk of transmission through animal contact is uncertain. There is no evidence suggesting animals (including domesticated animals) are a major source of infection in humans. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described in animals in both natural and experimental settings. There have been rare reports of animals with SARS-CoV-2 infection (including asymptomatic infections in dogs and symptomatic infections in cats) following close contact with a human with COVID-19 [64]. The risk of infection may vary by species. In one study evaluating infection in animals after intranasal viral inoculation, SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently in ferrets and cats; viral replication was also detected in dogs, but they appeared to be less susceptible overall to experimental infection [65]. Pigs and poultry were not susceptible to infection. Given the uncertainty regarding the transmission risk and the apparent susceptibility of some animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the United States CDC recommends that pets be kept away from other animals or people outside of the household and that people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 try to avoid close contact with household pets, as they should with human household members, for the duration of their self-isolation period. There have been no reports of domesticated animals transmitting SARS-CoV-2 infection to humans. Immunity and risk of reinfection — Antibodies to the virus are induced in those who have become infected. Preliminary evidence suggests that some of these antibodies are protective, but this remains to be definitively established. Moreover, it is unknown whether all infected patients mount a protective immune response and how long any protective effect will last.Data on protective immunity following COVID-19 are emerging [34,35,66]. A case series evaluating convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 identified neutralizing activity in plasma of recovered patients that appeared to be transferred to recipients following plasma infusion [66]. Similarly, in another study of 23 patients who recovered from COVID-19, antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in most patients by 14 days following the onset of symptoms; ELISA antibody titers correlated with neutralizing activity [34]. One preliminary study reported that rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 did not develop reinfection following recovery and rechallenge [67]; however, this study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and further confirmation of these findings is needed. Some studies have reported positive RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 following clinical improvement and negative results on two consecutive tests [68,69]. However, these positive tests occurred shortly after the negative tests, were not associated with worsening symptoms, may not represent infectious virus, and likely did not reflect reinfection.As above, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization for tests that qualitatively identify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum or plasma [46]. Should evidence confirm that the presence of these antibodies reflects a protective immune response, serologic screening will be an important tool to understand population immunity and distinguish individuals who are at lower risk for reinfection.CLINICAL FEATURESIncubation period — The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure [70-72].In a study of 1099 patients with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, the median incubation period was four days (interquartile range two to seven days) [71]. Using data from 181 publicly reported, confirmed cases in China with identifiable exposure, one modeling study estimated that symptoms would develop in 2.5 percent of infected individuals within 2.2 days and in 97.5 percent of infected individuals within 11.5 days [73]. The median incubation period in this study was 5.1 days.Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates — The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe [52,72,74-78]. Specifically, in a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity [79]: ●Mild (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in 81 percent.●Severe disease (eg, with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was reported in 14 percent.●Critical disease (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) was reported in 5 percent.●The overall case fatality rate was 2.3 percent; no deaths were reported among noncritical cases. Among hospitalized patients, the proportion of critical or fatal disease is higher [80,81]. In a study that included 2634 patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the New York City area, 14 percent were treated in the intensive care unit and 12 percent received invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality among those receiving mechanical ventilation was 88 percent [80]. However, the analysis was limited to patients who had either been discharged or died during the admission, and these patients represented fewer than half of the total population admitted with COVID-19; thus, the proportion of critically ill patients and the associated mortality rate may not accurately reflect those of the entire hospitalized population. The proportion of severe or fatal infections may also vary by location. According to a joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission, the case fatality rate ranged from 5.8 percent in Wuhan to 0.7 percent in the rest of China [30]. A modeling study suggested that the adjusted case fatality rate in mainland China was 1.4 percent [82]. Most of the fatal cases occurred in patients with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities [48,79]. In Italy, 12 percent of all detected COVID-19 cases and 16 percent of all hospitalized patients were admitted to the intensive care unit; the estimated case fatality rate was 7.2 percent in mid-March [83,84]. In contrast, the estimated case fatality rate in mid-March in South Korea was 0.9 percent [85]. This may be related to distinct demographics of infection; in Italy, the median age of patients with infection was 64 years, whereas in Korea the median age was in the 40s. (See 'Impact of age' below.)Risk factors for severe illness — Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but it predominantly occurs in adults with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities. The impact of age is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Impact of age' below.)Comorbidities and other conditions that have been associated with severe illness and mortality include (table 1) [48,79,86-89]: ●Cardiovascular disease●Diabetes mellitus●Hypertension●Chronic lung disease●Cancer (in particular hematologic malignancies, lung cancer, and metastatic disease) [90]●Chronic kidney disease●Obesity ●SmokingThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also includes immunocompromising conditions and liver disease as potential risk factors for severe illness [91], although specific data regarding risks associated with these conditions are limited. In a subset of 355 patients who died with COVID-19 in Italy, the mean number of pre-existing comorbidities was 2.7, and only 3 patients had no underlying condition [84]. Among patients with advanced age and medical comorbidities, COVID-19 is frequently severe. For example, in a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak across several long-term care facilities in Washington State, the median age of the 101 facility residents affected was 83 years, and 94 percent had a chronic underlying condition; the hospitalization and preliminary case fatality rates were 55 and 34 percent, respectively [92].Males have comprised a disproportionately high number of deaths in cohorts from China, Italy, and the United States [80,84,93].In a number of states in the United States, black and Latino individuals also appear to comprise a disproportionately high number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19, possibly related to underlying socioeconomic disparities [94-98]. Particular laboratory features have also been associated with worse outcomes (table 2). These include [48,99,100]: ●Lymphopenia●Elevated liver enzymes●Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)●Elevated inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein [CRP], ferritin)●Elevated D-dimer (>1 mcg/mL)●Elevated prothrombin time (PT)●Elevated troponin ●Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK)●Acute kidney injuryAs an example, in one study, progressive decline in the lymphocyte count and rise in the D-dimer over time were observed in nonsurvivors compared with more stable levels in survivors [52].Patients with severe disease have also been reported to have higher viral RNA levels in respiratory specimens than those with milder disease [47], although this association was not observed in a different study that measured viral RNA in salivary specimens [34]. Impact of age — Individuals of any age can acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, although adults of middle age and older are most commonly affected, and older adults are more likely to have severe disease. In several cohorts of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, the median age ranged from 49 to 56 years [52,75,76]. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections, 87 percent of patients were between 30 and 79 years old [79]. Similarly, in a modeling study based on data from mainland China, the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 increased with age, with a 1 percent rate for those 20 to 29 years old, 4 percent rate for those 50 to 59 years old, and 18 percent for those older than 80 years [82]. Older age is also associated with increased mortality [79,80,84]. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, case fatality rates were 8 and 15 percent among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older, respectively, in contrast to the 2.3 percent case fatality rate among the entire cohort [79]. Similar findings were reported from Italy, with case fatality rates of 12 and 20 percent among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older, respectively [84].In the United States, 2449 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 12 and March 16, 2020 had age, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) information available [101]; 67 percent of cases were diagnosed in those aged ≥45 years, and, similar to findings from China, mortality was highest among older individuals, with 80 percent of deaths occurring in those aged ≥65 years.Symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported [102-105]. Details of COVID-19 in children are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".) Asymptomatic infections — Asymptomatic infections have been well documented [72,106-112]. Their precise frequency is unknown, but several studies performed in various settings suggest that they are common. As examples:●In a COVID-19 outbreak on a cruise ship where nearly all passengers and staff were screened for SARS-CoV-2, approximately 17 percent of the population on board tested positive as of February 20; about half of the 619 confirmed COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [113]. A modeling study estimated that 18 percent were true asymptomatic cases (ie, did not go on to develop symptoms), although this was based on a number of assumptions, including the incubation period [108]. ●In a smaller COVID-19 outbreak within a skilled nursing facility, 27 of the 48 residents (56 percent) who had a positive screening test were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, but 24 of them ultimately developed symptoms over the next seven days [43]. ●Other studies have reported even higher proportions of asymptomatic cases [14,111]. As an example, in a report of a universal screening program of pregnant women presenting for delivery at two New York hospitals at the height of the pandemic there, 29 of 210 asymptomatic women without fever (14 percent) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal specimen [111]. Four additional women had fever or symptoms and also tested positive. Thus, of 33 women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 29 (88 percent) were asymptomatic on presentation.Even patients with asymptomatic infection may have objective clinical abnormalities [41,110]. As an example, in a study of 24 patients with asymptomatic infection who all underwent chest computed tomography (CT), 50 percent had typical ground-glass opacities or patchy shadowing, and another 20 percent had atypical imaging abnormalities [41]. Five patients developed low-grade fever, with or without other typical symptoms, a few days after diagnosis. In another study of 55 patients with asymptomatic infection identified through contact tracing, 67 percent had CT evidence of pneumonia on admission; only two patients developed hypoxia, and all recovered [110]. Clinical manifestationsInitial presentation — Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging [52,71,75,76]. However, other features, including upper respiratory tract symptoms, myalgias, diarrhea, and smell or taste disorders, are also common (table 3). There are no specific clinical features that can yet reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other viral respiratory infections, although development of dyspnea several days after the onset of initial symptoms is suggestive. (See 'Course and complications' below.) Most studies describing the clinical features of COVID-19 have been performed in hospitalized populations. In a study describing 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, the most common clinical features at the onset of illness were [52]:●Fever in 99 percent (note that fever on presentation is not this common in all studies; see below)●Fatigue in 70 percent●Dry cough in 59 percent●Anorexia in 40 percent●Myalgias in 35 percent●Dyspnea in 31 percent●Sputum production in 27 percentOther cohort studies of patients with confirmed COVID-19 have reported a similar range of clinical findings [52,75,114-116]. However, fever is not a universal finding on presentation. In one study, fever was reported in almost all patients, but approximately 20 percent had a very low grade fever <100.4°F/38°C [75]. In another study of 1099 patients from Wuhan and other areas in China, fever (defined as an axillary temperature over 99.5°F/37.5°C) was present in only 44 percent on admission but was ultimately noted in 89 percent during the hospitalization [71]. In a study of over 5000 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, only 31 percent had a temperature >100.4°F/38°C at presentation [80].Although not highlighted in the initial cohort studies from China, smell and taste disorders (eg, anosmia and dysgeusia) have also been reported as common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 [117-119]. In a survey of 59 patients with COVID-19 in Italy, 34 percent self-reported either a smell or taste aberration and 19 percent reported both [118]. In a survey of 202 outpatients with mild COVID-19 in Italy, 64 percent reported alterations in smell or taste, and 24 percent reported very severe alterations; smell or taste changes were reported as the only symptom in 3 percent overall and preceded symptoms in another 12 percent [120]. Whether this finding is a distinguishing feature of COVID-19 is uncertain. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea and diarrhea) have also been reported; and in some patients, they may be the presenting complaint [52,75,116,121]. In a systematic review of studies reporting on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with confirmed COVID-19, the pooled prevalence was 18 percent overall, with diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, or abdominal pain reported in 13, 10, and 9 percent, respectively [28]. Other reported symptoms have included headache, sore throat, and rhinorrhea [71,76]. Conjunctivitis has also been described [27].Dermatologic findings in patients with COVID-19 are not well characterized. There have been reports of maculopapular, urticarial, and vesicular eruptions and transient livedo reticularis [122-124]. Reddish-purple nodules on the distal digits similar in appearance to pernio (chilblains) have also been described, mainly in children and young adults with documented or suspected COVID-19, although an association has not been clearly established [124-127]. Some are calling this finding ""COVID toes.""Course and complications — As above, symptomatic infection can range from mild to critical. (See 'Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates' above.)Some patients with initially nonsevere symptoms may progress over the course of a week. In one study of 138 patients hospitalized in Wuhan for pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, dyspnea developed after a median of five days since the onset of symptoms, and hospital admission occurred after a median of seven days of symptoms [52]. In another study, the median time to dyspnea was eight days [75].Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major complication in patients with severe disease and can manifest shortly after the onset of dyspnea. In the study of 138 patients described above, ARDS developed in 20 percent a median of eight days after the onset of symptoms; mechanical ventilation was implemented in 12.3 percent [52]. In another study of 201 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, 41 percent developed ARDS; age greater than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were each associated with ARDS [99]. Other complications have included arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shock [52,93,128,129]. In one study, these were reported in 17, 7, and 9 percent, respectively [52]. In a series of 21 severely ill patients admitted to the ICU in the United States, one-third developed cardiomyopathy [128]. Thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism and acute stroke (even in patients younger than 50 years of age without risk factors), have also been reported [130-135]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome, with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines; these laboratory abnormalities have been associated with critical and fatal illnesses [75,136]. (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.) Guillain-Barré syndrome has also been reported, with onset 5 to 10 days after initial symptoms [137]. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome possibly associated with COVID-19, with clinical features similar to those of toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, has also been described in children. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Multisystem inflammatory syndrome'.)According to the WHO, recovery time appears to be around two weeks for mild infections and three to six weeks for severe disease [10].Laboratory findings — Common laboratory findings among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 include lymphopenia, elevated aminotransaminase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, ferritin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) [52,71,116]. Lymphopenia is especially common, even though the total white blood cell count can vary [52,75,76,138]. As an example, in a series of 393 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City, 90 percent had a lymphocyte count <1500/microL; leukocytosis (>10,000/microL) and leukopenia (<4000/microL) were each reported in approximately 15 percent [116]. Abnormalities in coagulation testing have also been observed; these are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Coagulation abnormalities'.)On admission, many patients with pneumonia have normal serum procalcitonin levels; however, in those requiring ICU care, they are more likely to be elevated [52,75,76].Several laboratory features, including high D-dimer levels and more severe lymphopenia, have been associated with mortality [76]. These are discussed elsewhere. (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.)Imaging findings — Chest radiographs may be normal in early or mild disease. In a retrospective study of 64 patients in Hong Kong with documented COVID-19, 20 percent did not have any abnormalities on chest radiograph at any point during the illness [139]. Common abnormal radiograph findings were consolidation and ground glass opacities, with bilateral, peripheral, and lower lung zone distributions; lung involvement increased over the course of illness, with a peak in severity at 10 to 12 days after symptom onset. Although chest CT may be more sensitive than chest radiograph and some chest CT findings may be characteristic of COVID-19, no finding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID-19. In the United States, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends not using chest CT for screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and recommends reserving it for hospitalized patients when needed for management [140]. If CT is performed, the Radiological Society of North America has categorized features as typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19, and has suggested corresponding language for the interpretation report (table 4) [141]. Chest CT in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia [115,142]. Case series have suggested that chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral, have a peripheral distribution, and involve the lower lobes. Less common findings include pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. In a study of 1014 patients in Wuhan who underwent both RT-PCR testing and chest CT for evaluation of COVID-19, a ""positive"" chest CT for COVID-19 (as determined by a consensus of two radiologists) had a sensitivity of 97 percent, using the PCR tests as a reference; however, specificity was only 25 percent [143]. The low specificity may be related to other etiologies causing similar CT findings. In another study comparing chest CTs from 219 patients with COVID-19 in China and 205 patients with other causes of viral pneumonia in the United States, COVID-19 cases were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80 versus 57 percent), ground-glass opacities (91 versus 68 percent), fine reticular opacities (56 versus 22 percent), vascular thickening (59 versus 22 percent), and reverse halo sign (11 versus 1 percent), but less likely to have a central and peripheral distribution (14 versus 35 percent), air bronchogram (14 versus 23 percent), pleural thickening (15 versus 33 percent), pleural effusion (4 versus 39 percent), and lymphadenopathy (2.7 versus 10 percent) [144]. A group of radiologists in that study was able to distinguish COVID-19 with high specificity but moderate sensitivity.In one report of 21 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who did not develop severe respiratory distress, lung abnormalities on chest imaging were most severe approximately 10 days after symptom onset [114]. However, chest CT abnormalities have also been identified in patients prior to the development of symptoms and even prior to the detection of viral RNA from upper respiratory specimens [115,145].Among patients who clinically improve, resolution of radiographic abnormalities may lag behind improvements in fever and hypoxia [146].DIAGNOSISClinical suspicion and criteria for testing — The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with new onset fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea). It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Other consistent symptoms include myalgias, diarrhea, and smell or taste aberrancies (table 3) (see 'Initial presentation' above). Although these syndromes can occur with other viral respiratory illnesses, the likelihood of COVID-19 is increased if the patient:●Resides in or has traveled within the prior 14 days to a location where there is community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; ie, large numbers of cases that cannot be linked to specific transmission chains); in such locations, residence in congregate settings or association with events where clusters of cases have been reported is a particularly high risk for exposure. (See 'Geographic distribution' above and 'Risk of transmission' above.) or●Has had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the prior 14 days, including through work in health care settings. Close contact includes being within approximately six feet (about two meters) of a patient for a prolonged period of time while not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) or having direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing PPE.Patients with suspected COVID-19 who do not need emergency care should be encouraged to call prior to presenting to a health care facility for evaluation. Many patients can be evaluated regarding the need for testing over the phone. For patients in a health care facility, infection control measures should be implemented as soon as the possibility of COVID-19 is suspected. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)If possible, all symptomatic patients with suspected infection should undergo testing; the diagnosis cannot be definitively made without microbiologic testing. However, limited capacity may preclude testing all patients with suspected COVID-19. Local health departments may have specific criteria for testing. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have suggested priorities for testing (table 5); high-priority individuals include hospitalized patients (especially critically ill patients with unexplained respiratory illness) and symptomatic individuals who are health care workers or first responders, work or reside in congregate living settings, or have risk factors for severe disease [147,148]. Testing certain asymptomatic individuals may also be important for public health or infection control purposes (eg, in congregate settings where COVID-19 cases have been identified, prior to time-sensitive surgical procedures, and prior to time-sensitive aerosol-generating procedures if PPE supplies are limited, and in hospitalized patients at locations where prevalence is high [eg, ≥10 percent]). The IDSA also recommends SARS-CoV-2 testing for asymptomatic immunocompromised patients who require hospitalization and for asymptomatic individuals prior to receiving immunosuppressive therapy [149]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Pretransplantation screening'.)Testing criteria suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) can be found in its technical guidance online. These are the same criteria used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk, particularly when no other cause of the symptoms is evident. The management of suspected cases when testing is not available is discussed elsewhere. (See 'COVID-19 testing not readily available' below.)Microbiologic diagnosisNAAT (RT-PCR) to diagnose current infection — The diagnosis of COVID-19 is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), primarily reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [150]. Various RT-PCR assays are used around the world; different assays amplify and detect different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Common gene targets include nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), spike (S), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), as well as regions in the first open reading frame [151]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for many different RT-PCR assays [46]; testing is performed by the CDC, local public health departments, hospital laboratories, and certain commercial reference laboratories. These tests have different performance characteristics and times to result (ranging from 15 minutes to several hours) and require different specimen types. The turnaround time for clinicians to receive a result also depends on how often the laboratory performs the test.Specimen collection — Upper respiratory samples are the primary specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. In the United States, the CDC recommends collection of one of the following specimens [152]:●Nasopharyngeal swab specimen, collected by a health care professional ●Oropharyngeal swab specimen, collected by a health care professional ●Nasal swab specimen from the anterior nares, collected by a health care professional or by the patient on-site or at home (in the United States, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization for a home-collection testing kit that can be mailed to the laboratory for testing [153])●Nasal or nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate, collected by a health care professionalHowever, there is uncertainty regarding the optimal upper respiratory tract specimen. The IDSA suggests nasopharyngeal, mid-turbinate, or nasal specimens rather than an oropharyngeal specimen (or saliva) because of limited data suggesting lower sensitivity with oropharyngeal specimens and lack of data on accuracy of saliva specimens [149].Lower respiratory tract specimens are also an option for testing; the IDSA suggests reserving these for hospitalized patients who have an initial negative test on an upper respiratory tract specimen but for whom suspicion for lower respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 infection remains [149]. For lower respiratory tract specimens, expectorated sputum should be collected from patients with productive cough, and tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage should be collected from patients who are intubated. Induction of sputum is not recommended. Additional information on testing and handling of clinical specimens can be found on the CDC website. Infection control practices during specimen collection are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)Data comparing the accuracy of testing from various sites are limited but suggest that test sensitivity may vary by type of specimen. Lower respiratory tract specimens may have higher viral loads and be more likely to yield positive tests than upper respiratory tract specimens [26,31]. In a study of 205 patients with COVID-19 who were sampled at various sites, the highest rates of positive viral RNA tests were reported from bronchoalveolar lavage (95 percent, 14 of 15 specimens) and sputum (72 percent, 72 of 104 specimens), compared with oropharyngeal swab (32 percent, 126 of 398 specimens) [26]. Data from this study suggested that viral RNA levels are higher and more frequently detected in nasal compared with oral specimens, although only eight nasal swabs were tested. Similarly, in another study in which 117 pairs of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens from 12 patients were tested simultaneously, 32 pairs were discordant with one test positive and the other negative: the nasopharyngeal specimen tested positive in 66 percent of those pairs compared with 34 percent for the oropharyngeal specimen [37]. However, other studies have not identified higher viral RNA levels in nasopharyngeal compared with oropharyngeal specimens [35]. Interpretation — A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, false-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been well documented. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, we suggest repeating the test. Repeat testing is performed 24 to 48 hours after the initial test. In such cases, the WHO and IDSA recommend testing a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has evidence of lower respiratory tract illness [149,154]. Infection control precautions for COVID-19 should continue while repeat evaluation is being performed. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing and concern for false-negative results, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk (residence in or travel to an area with widespread community transmission or known contact). In such cases, particularly for hospitalized patients who have negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, characteristic laboratory or imaging findings can further support the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and be reasons to maintain infection control precautions. Nevertheless, other potential causes of symptoms should also be considered in patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. The interpretation of an inconclusive or indeterminate result depends on the specific RT-PCR assay performed; the clinician should confer with the performing laboratory about additional testing.The accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 tests have not been systematically evaluated, and the sensitivity of testing likely depends on the precise RT-PCR assay, the type of specimen obtained, the quality of the specimen, and duration of illness at the time of testing. In a study of 51 patients who were hospitalized in China with fever or acute respiratory symptoms and ultimately had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test (mainly on throat swabs), 15 patients (29 percent) had a negative initial test and only were diagnosed by serial testing [155]. In a similar study of 70 patients in Singapore, initial nasopharyngeal testing was negative in 8 patients (11 percent) [156]. In both studies, rare patients were repeatedly negative and only tested positive after four or more tests.The likelihood of a positive upper respiratory RT-PCR may be higher early in the course of illness. One study using a combination of RT-PCR and an immunoglobulin (Ig)M serologic test to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 suggested that RT-PCR positivity rates were >90 percent on days 1 to 3 of illness, <80 percent at day 6, and <50 percent after day 14; however, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the serologic test used was not validated for detection of acute infection and IgM tests are generally prone to false positivity [157].Test performance by specimen type is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Specimen collection' above.)Serology to identify prior infection — Serologic tests detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, and those that have been adequately validated can help identify patients who have had COVID-19. Serologic tests may also be able to identify some patients with current infection (particularly those who present late in the course of illness), but they are less likely to be reactive in the first several days to weeks of infection, and thus may have less utility for diagnosis in the acute setting [157-160]. In the United States, several serologic tests have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA for use by laboratories certified to perform moderate- and high-complexity tests [46]. The FDA highlights that serologic tests should not be used as the sole test to diagnose or exclude active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity and specificity of many of these serologic tests are uncertain; a catalog of these tests can be found at centerforhealthsecurity.org.Detectable antibodies generally take several days to weeks to develop. In a study of 173 patients with COVID-19, the median time from symptom onset to antibody detection (with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] that detects antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein) was 12 days for IgM and 14 days for IgG [158]. In the first week since symptom onset, fewer than 40 percent had detectable antibodies; by day 15, IgM and IgG were detectable in 94 and 80 percent, respectively. The accuracy and time to antibody detection vary with the particular test used. Studies evaluating the specificity of serologic tests in a broad population are lacking; in particular, the rate of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses is a potential concern, and IgM tests are prone to false-positive results.Large-scale serologic screening with validated tests may be able to provide a better sense of the scope of the burden of disease (by identifying people who were not diagnosed by PCR or who may have had asymptomatic or subclinical infection) and also identify individuals who may have immunity to infection; serologic correlates of protective immunity, however, have not been defined. (See 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' above and 'Immunity and risk of reinfection' above.)Other tests●Tests that identify SARS-CoV-2 antigen are under development, although rapid antigen tests for respiratory pathogens are typically less sensitive than PCR in detecting viral nucleic acid (see ""Diagnosis of seasonal influenza in adults"", section on 'Rapid antigen tests'). Several manufacturers are selling rapid, point-of-care tests based on antigen testing or antibody detection, but the WHO does not recommend these tests because of accuracy concerns in the absence of validation studies [161].●For safety reasons, specimens from a patient with suspected or documented COVID-19 should not be submitted for viral culture. Testing for other pathogens — If influenza is circulating in the community, it is reasonable to also test for influenza when testing for SARS-CoV-2, as this could have management implications. However, detection of another viral (or bacterial) pathogen does not necessarily rule out SARS-CoV-2 in locations where there is widespread transmission. Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, including influenza, has been described, but the reported frequency is variable [80,162-164].MANAGEMENT — Home management is appropriate for patients with mild infection (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea) or asymptomatic infection who can adequately self-isolate in the outpatient setting. Management of such patients should focus on prevention of transmission to others and monitoring for clinical deterioration, which should prompt hospitalization. Management of patients who warrant hospitalization consists of ensuring appropriate infection control and supportive care (including oxygenation and potentially ventilatory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome). Investigational approaches are also being evaluated, and should be used in the setting of a clinical trial, whenever available. Management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)PREVENTIONInfection control in the health care setting — In locations where community transmission is widespread, preventive strategies for all individuals in a health care setting are warranted to reduce potential exposures. Additional measures are warranted for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Infection control in the health care setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Preventing exposure in the community — If community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is present, residents should be encouraged to practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave home. In particular, individuals should avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals. The following general measures are additionally recommended to reduce transmission of infection:●Diligent hand washing, particularly after touching surfaces in public. Use of hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol is a reasonable alternative if the hands are not visibly dirty. ●Respiratory hygiene (eg, covering the cough or sneeze).●Avoiding touching the face (in particular eyes, nose, and mouth). The American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests that people not wear contact lenses, because they make people touch their eyes more frequently [165].●Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that are frequently touched. The CDC has issued guidance on disinfection in the home setting; a list of EPA-registered products can be found here. These measures should be followed by all individuals, but should be emphasized for older adults and individuals with chronic medical conditions, in particular. For people without respiratory symptoms, the WHO does not recommend wearing a medical mask in the community, since it does not decrease the importance of other general measures to prevent infection and may result in unnecessary cost and supply problems; the WHO also emphasizes that medical masks should be prioritized for health care workers [166]. Recommendations on use of masks by healthy members of the community vary by country [167]. In the United States, the CDC updated its recommendations in early April to advise individuals to wear a cloth face covering (eg, homemade masks or bandanas) when in public settings where social distancing is difficult to achieve, especially in areas with substantial community transmission [168]. Individuals should be counseled to avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth when removing the covering, practice hand hygiene after handling it, and launder it routinely. Clinicians should emphasize that the face covering does not diminish the importance of other preventive measures, such as social distancing and hand hygiene. The rationale for the face covering is primarily to contain secretions of and prevent transmission from individuals who have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection. The CDC also reiterates that the face covering recommendation does not include medical masks, which should be reserved for health care workers.Individuals who are caring for patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 at home should also wear a face cover when in the same room as that patient (if the patient cannot wear a face cover). Individuals who develop an acute respiratory illness (eg, with fever and/or respiratory symptoms) should be encouraged to self-isolate at home (away from other individuals and pets in the household) for the duration of the illness and wear a face cover if they have to be around other people. Some may warrant evaluation for COVID-19. (See 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Isolation at home'.) The efficacy of masks in containing SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)The CDC has included recommended measures to prevent spread in the community on its website. Managing asymptomatic individuals with potential exposure — In areas where SARS-CoV-2 is prevalent, all residents should be encouraged to stay alert for symptoms and practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave the home. In the United States, the CDC suggests this approach for all residents [169]. For those returning from international travel (including cruise ship travel) and those who have had close contact with a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (including during the 48 hours prior to that patient developing symptoms), the CDC also suggests [169,170]:●Self-quarantine at home for 14 days following the last exposure, with maintenance of at least six feet (two meters) from others at all times. ●Avoiding contact with individuals at high risk for severe illness (unless they are household members with the same exposure). (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.)●Twice-daily temperature checks with monitoring for fever, cough, or dyspnea. If they develop such clinical manifestations, they should continue to stay at home away from other household members and contact their medical providers. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients'.) For asymptomatic individuals who are critical infrastructure workers, the CDC has provided guidance on returning to work during the 14-day post-exposure period with symptom and temperature monitoring, mask use, social distancing, and workspace disinfection [171].Management of health care workers with a documented exposure is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Return to work for health care workers'.) Global public health measures — On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread. The WHO has indicated three priorities for countries: protecting health workers, engaging communities to protect those at highest risk of severe disease (eg, older adults and those with medical comorbidities), and supporting vulnerable countries in containing infection [10].The WHO does not recommend international travel restrictions but does acknowledge that movement restriction may be temporarily useful in some settings. The WHO advises exit screening for international travelers from areas with ongoing transmission of COVID-19 virus to identify individuals with fever, cough, or potential high-risk exposure [172,173]. Many countries also perform entry screening (eg, temperature, assessment for signs and symptoms). More detailed travel information is available on the WHO website. In the United States, the CDC currently recommends that individuals avoid all nonessential international travel and nonessential travel from some domestic locations [174]. Because risk of travel changes rapidly, travelers should check United States government websites for possible restrictions. Other public health measures that have been variably employed in different countries include social distancing and stay-at-home ordinances, aggressive contact tracing and quarantine (separating individuals who may have been exposed from others), restricting traffic to or from areas of very high prevalence, and policies on face masks or coverings in public. In an epidemiologic study, a number of interventions (implementation of travel restrictions in and around Wuhan with home quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing in public, followed by centralized quarantine for all cases and contacts, followed by proactive symptom screening for all residents) were associated with progressive reductions in the incidence of confirmed cases in Wuhan and a decrease in the effective reproduction number (ie, the average number of secondary cases for each case in a population made up of both susceptible and nonsusceptible individuals) from >3 prior to the interventions to 0.3 after them [175]. Investigational approachesVaccines — Numerous vaccine candidates are being evaluated for prevention of COVID-19 [176]. The first vaccine to undergo preliminary study in humans in the United States uses a messenger RNA platform to result in expression of the viral spike protein in order to induce an immune response [177]. There is also interest in Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunization for prevention of COVID-19, and clinical trials are underway to evaluate its use among health care workers [178]. Studies have suggested that, although its primary purpose is prevention of tuberculosis, BCG immunization induces a nonspecific immune response that may have protective effects against non-mycobacterial, including viral, infections [179,180]. Any impact of BCG immunization on COVID-19 specifically is unknown. The WHO recommends BCG vaccination not be used for prevention or lessening the severity of COVID-19, pending further data [181]. Post-exposure prophylaxis — Clinical trials are also being conducted in the United States and elsewhere to evaluate the safety and efficacy of post-exposure drug prophylaxis against COVID-19 [182,183]. No agent is known to be effective in preventing infection; we suggest post-exposure prophylaxis not be attempted outside a clinical trial. SPECIAL SITUATIONSPregnant and breastfeeding women — The general approach to prevention, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 is largely similar to that in nonpregnant individuals. Issues specific to pregnant and breastfeeding women are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".) Children — Symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported [102-105]. Details of COVID-19 in children are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".) COVID-19 testing not readily available — In some cases, testing for COVID-19 may not be accessible, particularly for individuals who have a compatible but mild illness that does not warrant hospitalization and do not have a known COVID-19 exposure or high-risk travel history. In the United States, there is limited official guidance for this situation, and the approach may depend on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the area. If the clinician has sufficient concern for possible COVID-19 (eg, there is community transmission and there is no other apparent cause for the symptoms), it is reasonable to assume the patient had COVID-19 and advise the patient to self-isolate at home (if hospitalization is not warranted) and alert the clinician about worsening symptoms. Outpatient management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.) SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, now designated SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan, a city in China. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Since the first reports of COVID-19, infection has spread to include more than four million confirmed cases worldwide, prompting the WHO to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms who reside in or have traveled to areas with community transmission or who have had recent close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. Clinicians should also be aware of the possibility of COVID-19 in patients with severe respiratory illness when no other etiology can be identified. Other symptoms have also been associated with COVID-19 (table 3). Limitations in testing capacity may preclude testing all patients with suspected infection; suggested priorities include hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals who are health care workers or first responders, work or reside in congregate living settings, or have risk factors for severe disease (table 5). (See 'Clinical features' above and 'Diagnosis' above.)●The microbiologic diagnosis is made by a positive nucleic acid amplification test (eg, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) for SARS-CoV-2. An upper respiratory tract specimen is the preferred initial test specimen. If possible, all symptomatic patients with suspected infection should undergo testing. However, because of limited testing capacity and concern for false-negative testing, the diagnosis is often presumptively made based on consistent clinical and epidemiologic features. Serologic tests can help identify individuals with prior infection but have less utility in the first weeks of infection. (See 'Microbiologic diagnosis' above.)●Upon suspicion of COVID-19, infection control measures should be implemented. Infection control in health care settings is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.) ●Management consists of supportive care, although investigational approaches are being evaluated. Home management is appropriate for patients with mild illness who can adequately self-isolate in the outpatient setting. A minority of patients need critical care. Home, hospital, and intensive care unit management of patients with COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, individuals should be advised to wash hands diligently, practice respiratory hygiene (eg, cover their cough), and avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals, if possible. Social distancing is recommended in locations that have community transmission. In some locations, face coverings are advised in public settings. (See 'Preventing exposure in the community' above.)●Interim guidance has been issued by the WHO and by the CDC. These are updated on an ongoing basis.

ID:127828,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Psychiatric symptoms and disorders,"INTRODUCTION — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have reached pandemic scale worldwide in 2020 [1]. The disease is associated with multiple psychiatric problems in clinicians who care for patients with COVID-19 or suspected illness [2,3]. In addition, COVID-19 may precipitate anxiety, depression, and sleep problems in patients with COVID-19 and may adversely affect patients with established psychiatric disorders. This topic addresses the epidemiology, clinical features, course of illness, and management of psychiatric issues that are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Other topics discuss COVID-19 per se and related issues arising in different specialties, such as cardiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and oncology.EPIDEMIOLOGY — A limited number of studies describe the prevalence of mental health sequelae associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinicians — Mental health symptoms and disorders can occur in clinicians exposed to COVID-19 [3]. As an example, one cross-sectional study used self-report instruments to assess hospital-based physicians and nurses (total n >1200) in China from January 29 to February 3, 2020 [2]. The prevalence of moderate to severe psychiatric symptoms was as follows:●Anxiety – 12 percent●Depression – 15 percent●Insomnia – 8 percent●Traumatic distress – 35 percentIn addition, roughly one-quarter to one-third of clinicians had mild symptoms. Another cross-sectional study assessed nearly 300 hospital-based physicians and nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in Singapore from February 19 to March 13, 2020, using self-report screening instruments [4]. Relatively few clinicians screened positive for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (approximately 5 to 10), which the authors attributed to better preparedness of the clinicians based upon their previous experience with the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic.Risk factors for psychiatric problems in clinicians who care for patients with COVID-19 include increased proximity to affected patients and infection hotspots. One study found that symptoms of any severity were most likely to occur in health care workers having the greatest direct contact with patients (eg, nurses, most of whom were women) [2]. Patients with COVID-19 — Few data are available regarding psychiatric problems in patients with COVID-19. However, based upon studies conducted during the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong, we anticipate that many patients with COVID-19 will develop anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, PTSD, and substance use disorders [5,6]. As an example, at the peak of the 2003 epidemic, a prospective study enrolled 79 patients with SARS, including 30 infected health care workers (primarily nurses), and 145 healthy controls [7]. Self-reported stress was greater among the infected patients than controls, as were negative psychological effects such as dysphoria, impaired sleep, poor concentration, and impaired judgment. However, most patients and controls also reported positive psychological effects such as awareness of hygiene, physical state, and current affairs. In addition, COVID-19 appears to affect central nervous system function, which may indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are likely to occur in some patients. (See 'Pathogenesis' below.) Patients with existing psychiatric illnesses — We anticipate that many patients with existing mental disorders (prior to COVID-19) will be adversely impacted by the psychological effects of COVID-19 and physical distancing [3,5,8,9]. Patients with anxiety disorders and depressive disorders may be susceptible to the continuous media reporting about the pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding its eventual outcome. In addition, the psychological effects of quarantine can be negative, including anger, confusion, and PTSD symptoms, and these effects may be long-lasting [10]. Patients with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and individuals who are homeless are especially likely to suffer from the pandemic, being at risk not only for COVID-19 based upon their social circumstances, but also more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses that put them at risk for poorer health outcomes once infected [11,12]. In addition, their cognitive difficulties and marginalized social status may impair their ability to follow public health prescriptions intended to minimize spread of the infection.General population — A cross-sectional study of Chinese students in grades 2 through 6, who were quarantined at home for an average of 34 days, found that anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were each reported by roughly 20 percent and almost two-thirds were worried about becoming infected [13]. Older individuals (eg, ≥70 years), immunocompromised patients, and patients with chronic disease are also likely to experience increased anxiety, depression, and worry [8,14]. PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms and disorders that arise during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may include biologic and psychosocial factors.COVID-19 appears to directly affect central nervous system function. A retrospective chart review of patients with COVID-19 (n = 214) found that central nervous system manifestations (eg, dizziness, headache, or impaired consciousness) occurred in 25 percent [15]. In addition, a review found that past viral epidemics were associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as demyelination, encephalopathy, and neuromuscular dysfunction, as well as mood changes and psychosis [16]. The symptoms occurred during infection or following recovery from the infection in the ensuing weeks, months, or longer. Immunologic findings in patients with COVID-19 include elevated serum C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-6) and decreased total blood lymphocyte counts [16].In addition, psychiatric illnesses that occur during the pandemic may stem from psychosocial factors such as [3,5,8,9]:●Frequency and extent of exposure to individuals infected with COVID-19●Fear of infecting family members●Lack of access to testing and medical care●Physical distancing, home confinement, and quarantining●Inconsistent messages and directives regarding public health measures such as wearing face masks●Increased workloads●Economic hardships and insecurity●Shortages of available resources (eg, foods, paper products, and personal protective equipment)●Diminished personal freedomsCLINICAL FEATURES — The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be associated with psychiatric symptoms that do not necessarily rise to the level of a psychiatric disorder, based upon studies of previous epidemics. As an example, a review of 24 studies examined the psychological impact of quarantine in 10 countries during infectious disease outbreaks such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory system epidemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak [10]. Adverse psychological outcomes included anger, anxiety, boredom, confusion, fear, depression, emotional exhaustion, frustration, irritability, and stress. Other adverse outcomes include avoidance behaviors (eg, avoiding crowded or public places), detachment from others, subthreshold symptoms of alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, excessive preoccupation with distressing somatic symptoms, and stigma, as well as domestic violence and suicidal ideation and behavior [8,10].In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may also lead to full-blown anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder; these disorders are discussed separately: ●(See ""Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●(See ""Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●(See ""Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features"".)●(See ""Evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia in adults"", section on 'Clinical features'.)●(See ""Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)COURSE OF ILLNESS — Psychiatric problems related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may persist for at least three years beyond the pandemic, based upon retrospective studies of the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic. In these studies, individuals who were exposed to or survived SARS infection were assessed 2.5 to 3 years after the epidemic; moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were still present in roughly 20 to 30 percent. The risk for persistent psychiatric symptoms and disorders was higher in health care workers and individuals who were quarantined:●One year after the SARS epidemic, a study enrolled 96 individuals who survived SARS infection (including 33 health care workers) and 112 healthy controls [17]. Self-reported stress was greater among the SARS survivors than controls, and greater among health care worker SARS survivors than non-health care worker survivors. In addition, moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were present in approximately 33 percent of all survivors; anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were greater in females than males, and greater in health care worker SARS survivors than non-health care worker survivors.●In a study of hospital employees (n = 549) who were exposed to the SARS epidemic in Beijing, self-report assessments three years later indicated that moderate to severe depressive symptoms were present in 23 percent [18]. Perceived risk related to SARS during the epidemic and quarantining during the epidemic were each associated with higher levels of depression at follow-up.In addition, the assessments three years later found that among the 549 health care workers, at least one symptom of alcohol use disorder was present in approximately 19 percent [19]. Working in high risk locations (eg, SARS wards) during the epidemic and quarantining during the epidemic were each associated with symptoms of alcohol use disorder. ●A study interviewed 90 survivors of SARS infection approximately 2.5 years after hospitalization for the illness; a history of psychiatric disorders prior to infection was present in 7 percent [20]. At 2.5 years post-SARS, at least one psychiatric disorder was present in 33 percent of the survivors, including PTSD in 26 percent and depressive disorders in 16 percent. In addition, social and role functioning were each impaired in survivors.   ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS — Assessment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder are discussed separately: ●(See ""Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia in adults"".)●(See ""Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)MANAGEMENT — Psychiatric issues related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can occur in multiple populations, including clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 or suspected illness, patients with COVID-19, and patients with established psychiatric disorders prior to COVID-19. In addition, family members of clinicians and patients may develop psychiatric symptoms or disorders. General approach — For individuals who experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, stepped care may be an efficacious and cost-effective approach to providing care [21]. According to this approach, monitoring mental health problems is paramount. Surveillance for domestic violence and child abuse, both of which are predicted to increase during mandated stay-at-home orders, is also critical [21]. Individuals with low levels of symptoms are provided with self-help materials pertinent to their symptoms and concerns and are eligible to speak with a mental health professional if they have additional or persistent concerns. Other interventions that may help individuals cope with mild psychiatric symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic include limiting one’s intake of print and broadcast news about the pandemic, as well as maintaining routines and structured activities such as exercise [8]. Health care workers in particular are likely to benefit from private, on-demand access to mental health professionals who can address sources of anxiety, distress, and other emotions related to caring for patients [22,23]. Individuals with moderate to severe symptoms can be treated by their primary care provider or referred to a mental health specialist.If feasible, psychiatric care should be administered by computer or telephone rather than face-to-face [11,24]. Patient contact through voice or voice plus video may be superior to text messages and emails [5]. When face-to-face visits are necessary, personal protective equipment (eg, masks) should be used and care should ideally be administered to individuals rather than groups. In-person visits with masks may be experienced as less personal and leave patients feeling less connected to the clinician, compared with voice plus video meetings.Psychiatrists may be asked to consult on patients receiving pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 and should therefore be familiar with some of the medications currently being used. As an example, hydroxychloroquine, which is an antimalarial drug that is used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients (and undergoing clinical trials), is associated with psychiatric side effects such as mood and anxiety disturbances, insomnia, and more rarely, psychosis. Patients should be asked about any other prescribed medications or supplements they may be taking in the belief they might reduce vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Specific interactions of psychiatric medications with other medications may be determined using the Lexicomp drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. Specific medications that are being evaluated for COVID-19 are described separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Specific treatments'.)Physical distancing, which is widely encouraged to decelerate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within the general public and “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 cases, will result in loneliness for some individuals, particularly those living alone, including the elderly. This is likely to exacerbate the high rates of loneliness already experienced by the elderly, especially those who rely on social services rather than family for human contact and connection [14]. Digital technology may serve as a bridge for social connections and should be encouraged [5,25]. However, many individuals may lack access or the ability to take advantage of this.In the context of physical distancing, most inpatient facilities have restricted or suspended visits by families and friends [26]. Family members of a loved one who is severely ill or dying will respond with grief. The treatment team should ask the family about thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to their loss, as well as provide grief counseling as warranted. (See ""Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features"" and ""Grief and bereavement in adults: Management"".)  Addressing stressors — Potential sources of anxiety and distress that should be addressed include [22,23]:  ●Access to personal protective equipment●Risk of self-exposure and infection●Risk of exposing others to infection●Access to testing●Access to up-to-date, accurate information about COVID-19●Access to childcare during school closures●Increased and taxing workloads●Moral dilemmas and moral injury arising from situations such as deciding how to allocate insufficient resources, inadvertently placing others in danger, and implementing clinical decisions by others that one thinks are contrary to best practices●Loss of control/vulnerability ●Availability and use of support from colleagues and managers●Patient deaths and family griefBased upon a study of clinicians in public hospital emergency departments (n = 466) in Hong Kong during the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic [27], the most frequent coping strategies included accepting the reality of the stressor, taking action to circumvent the stressor, and viewing the situation in a more positive light and attempting to grow from the situation.A follow-up study of hospital employees who were exposed to the 2003 SARS epidemic in Beijing (n = 549) found that higher levels of altruistic acceptance of risk during the outbreak (eg, “I want to help the patients and accept the risk”) were associated with lower levels of self-reported depressive symptoms three years later [18]. Quarantine — A review of 24 studies that examined the adverse psychological impact of quarantine suggested the following steps to mitigate the negative effects [10]: ●Explain the purpose of quarantine and how to implement it.●Voluntary quarantine is associated with less distress than mandatory quarantine.●Emphasize the altruistic benefit of quarantine in keeping others safe.●Facilitate acquisition of general (eg, food and housing) and medical supplies (eg, prescriptions, thermometers, and face masks).Addressing suicidality — The hardships imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including economic privation, social isolation, and reduced access to general medical and mental health care may give rise to suicidal ideation and behavior [8,9]. Suicide has been reported as an adverse effect of quarantine during previous viral epidemics [28].Individuals with moderate to severe distress, anxiety, or depression should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behavior; one can use a screening tool or simply ask. Patients with COVID-19 and patients with established psychiatric disorders should be encouraged to maintain social contact through telephone or computer, as well as face-to-face encounters that maintain physical distancing. In addition, patients should be encouraged to access treatment through telehealth or in-person.Additional risk factors for suicidality, as well as assessment and management, are discussed separately. (See ""Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"".)Specific disorders — Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that are associated with COVID-19 should follow recommendations for treating the general population of patients with these disorders and are discussed separately: ●(See ""Approach to treating generalized anxiety disorder in adults"".)●(See ""Approach to treating panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults"".)●(See ""Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"".)●(See ""Overview of the treatment of insomnia in adults"".)●(See ""Approach to treating posttraumatic stress disorder in adults"".)Schizophrenia — Pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for acute symptoms of schizophrenia that are associated with COVID-19 should follow recommendations for treating the general population of patients with schizophrenia and are discussed separately. (See ""Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Acute and maintenance phase treatment"" and ""Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia"".)Home visits — For patients with schizophrenia who are acutely ill with mild to moderate symptoms, daily home visits by clinicians and 24-hour coverage may be a reasonable alternative to inpatient hospitalization [24,29]. This allows patients to maintain physical distancing and home confinement, and thus avoid exposure to COVID-19. For patients with schizophrenia who are stable, home visits may be suitable to promote adherence to treatment and prevent relapse.Clozapine bloodwork — Patients receiving clozapine for schizophrenia or other serious mental illness typically require blood tests every one to four weeks to monitor absolute neutrophil counts. However, patients and clinicians need to decide whether the risks of COVID-19 outweigh the benefits of obtaining blood work. (See ""Guidelines for prescribing clozapine in schizophrenia"", section on 'Required bloodwork and coronavirus disease 2019'.)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.●General guidance from public health authorities (eg, World Health Organization or United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) – (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)●More detailed guidance for specialty care, including psychiatry – (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Psychiatry'.) ●Resources for psychiatric patients and their families – (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".) INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, “The Basics” and “Beyond the Basics.” The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on “patient info” and the keyword(s) of interest.) ●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")Patient education material is also available through the United States National Institute of Mental Health and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.SUMMARY●In one study from China, clinicians treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) developed moderate to severe psychiatric symptoms, including:•Anxiety – 12 percent•Depression – 15 percent•Insomnia – 8 percent•Distress – 35 percent(See 'Clinicians' above.)●The pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms and disorders that arise during the COVID-19 pandemic may include biologic and psychosocial factors. (See 'Pathogenesis' above.)●The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with psychiatric symptoms that do not necessarily rise to the level of a psychiatric disorder. In addition, the pandemic may lead to full-blown psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, or posttraumatic stress disorder. (See 'Clinical features' above.) ●Psychiatric problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic may persist for at least three years beyond the pandemic. In studies of a prior epidemic that assessed individuals 2.5 to 3 years after the epidemic, moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder were present in roughly 20 to 30 percent of individuals. In addition, the risk for persistent psychiatric symptoms and disorders was higher in health care workers and individuals who quarantined. (See 'Course of illness' above.) ●For individuals who experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder, stepped care may be an efficacious and cost-effective approach; surveillance of mental health problems is paramount. Those with low levels of symptoms are provided with self-help materials and are eligible to speak with a mental health professional if they have additional or persistent concerns. Individuals with moderate to severe symptoms can be treated by their primary care provider or a mental health specialist. (See 'General approach' above.)●Mental health professionals working with individuals who develop psychiatric issues related to COVID-19 should address potential sources of anxiety and distress, including risk of self-exposure and infection, risk of exposing others to infection, increased and taxing workloads, moral dilemmas, and patient deaths. (See 'Addressing stressors' above.)●The adverse psychological impact of quarantine may be mitigated by taking steps such as explaining the purpose of quarantine and how to implement it, as well as emphasizing the altruistic benefit of quarantine in keeping others safe. (See 'Quarantine' above.)●The hardships imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic may give rise to suicidal ideation and behavior. Individuals with moderate to severe distress, anxiety, or depression should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients with COVID-19 and patients with established psychiatric disorders should be encouraged to maintain social contact and to access treatment through telehealth or in-person.

ID:127759,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the infection rapidly spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. The coronavirus is now designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness it causes is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to mild respiratory tract symptoms to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction. Our understanding of the spectrum of disease as well as optimal management strategies continues to evolve.This topic will address the management of patients with COVID-19 (presumed and confirmed) in the outpatient setting, including self-care advice, telehealth, outpatient clinic management, and emergency department (ED) referral. It is important to note that there are limited data informing outpatient management strategies, and the approach described here is based upon our clinical experience; clinicians should take into the account the individual patient's clinical and social circumstances as well as the available resources.General management strategies, including infection control measures, care for hospitalized patients, and specific COVID-19 complications, are discussed in detail elsewhere, as are considerations for special populations:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Psychiatric symptoms and disorders"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)GENERAL PRINCIPLESContinuum of care — When possible, we favor managing all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 within an outpatient continuum of care management program that includes:●Self-assessment tools. (See 'Patient self-assessment tools' below.)●Initial telephone triage. (See 'Initial telephone triage' below.)●Coordinated outreach and management approach based upon individual patient risk, severity of symptoms, and time course of disease. (See 'Risk stratification' below and 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below and 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)●Clinician telehealth (telephone call or video platform-based) visits (initial evaluation and follow-up visits) [1]. (See 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)●COVID-19 testing. (See 'Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing' below.)●A separate outpatient respiratory clinic or dedicated space within an ambulatory clinic appropriated for the care of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory problems. Strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by staff and other patients should be employed [2]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)In addition, the outpatient clinic should have a close, coordinated relationship with the local emergency department (ED) and function in partnership within the continuum of care program. (See 'Rationale for outpatient management and remote care' below.)●A close working relationship with local public health officials and community leaders.In such a system, patients could enter the ambulatory COVID-19 care program by contacting their primary health care provider or following discharge from the ED or an inpatient hospital stay.In addition, during the course of illness and recovery, patients would be able to transition to different sites of care for follow-up as dictated by clinical need (eg, from home self-care management, to outpatient clinic or ED evaluation, to telehealth follow-up, and back to self-care management).Rationale for outpatient management and remote care — Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients with COVID-19; in approximately 80 percent of patients, illness is mild and does not warrant medical intervention or hospitalization [3]. In addition, remote (telehealth) management is preferred for the majority of patients for the following reasons:●Remote management can prevent unnecessary in-person medical visits, including visits to urgent care facilities and EDs. It thus avoids additional, unnecessary strain on an already overburdened and overwhelmed health care system (including utilization of limited resources, especially personal protective equipment [PPE]).●In-person health care provider visits require the patient to leave their home, traveling via public, private, or emergency transport and potentially exposing others to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, upon arrival at a health care facility, patients may expose other patients and health care workers to the virus.Creating a comprehensive, coordinated outpatient care program that incorporates these components may allow more patients to receive supportive care at home and, if necessary, in the ambulatory clinic setting, further reducing ED and hospital resource utilization.Telehealth has been used for patient management during previous disease outbreaks, including SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza A H1N1 [4]. However, remote evaluation has not been studied in the setting of a global pandemic nor in caring for patients with COVID-19; thus, evidence that demonstrates improved outcomes with home management of COVID-19 is lacking.Telehealth evaluation for COVID-19 during the pandemic can be performed by telephone call, video-based telemedicine platform, or commercial video chat platform; the format chosen should be compliant with applicable patient privacy regulations [5].Flexibility in approach to care — High-quality data supporting the superiority of any single outpatient management strategy are lacking, and treatment protocols are being developed and modified as understanding of the disease evolves.Our approach is based upon our clinical experience of treating patients with COVID-19 and places additional emphasis on avoiding infection transmission, preserving limited resources (including tests and PPE), and reducing the burden on overwhelmed health care systems.The intensity (frequency and duration) of outpatient follow-up will vary according to a patient's risk for developing severe disease (table 1), will vary by institution, region, and resource availability, and will likely change with the burden of disease in a given location. As an example, some institutions have been able to establish dedicated respiratory clinics devoted to managing COVID-19 patients, with available in-person and remote management options; in many other locations, these patients are being managed by primary care clinicians, often in consultation with a team of specially trained clinicians.Additionally, institutions may need to revise protocols, even over a several-week period, in response to surges in the number of patients with suspected infection they are managing [6].INITIAL EVALUATION — Most patients who have concerns about COVID-19, even those with mild symptoms, will likely initiate contact with the health care system. For those patients, self-assessment tools, or remote (telehealth) evaluation are the preferred initial management approaches [7-9].Patient self-assessment tools — Patient education materials, including self-assessment tools, can help patients determine if medical evaluation is necessary, and proactive dissemination of these materials may increase awareness and encourage their use. Various online self-assessment tools published by medical institutions and governmental health agencies can guide patients through questions and suggest when to seek medical care; by following the guidance, many patients with mild illness may be able to recover at home on their own without needing to come in direct contact with a health care provider. Before recommending a specific assessment tool, however, clinicians should vet the options carefully, as they may exceed the abilities of patients with limited health literacy or can become quickly out-of-date based upon rapidly changing guidelines.In one study, use of a self-assessment tool embedded into the electronic health record allowed 40 percent of symptomatic patients to be appropriately triaged to self-care [9]. This study, however, was conducted in the setting of relatively low community prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and might not be representative of settings with widespread community transmission.Initial telephone triage — In addition to self-assessment tools, an initial triage call by clinic staff can often determine which patients are appropriate for self-care at home, which patients warrant a timely clinician telehealth visit (televisit), and which patients warrant an outpatient clinic visit or urgent emergency department (ED) evaluation [10]. (See 'Risk stratification' below.) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)Any patient with symptoms suggestive of respiratory compromise or hypoxia (eg, significant dyspnea at rest or mental confusion) should be referred for urgent in-person evaluation; the appropriate site of care depends upon the severity of symptoms and is discussed elsewhere. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing — During a pandemic, patients who live in regions with widespread community transmission and have compatible symptoms are generally managed presumptively as having COVID-19, even if they have not been tested or have an initial negative test result.Patients with COVID-19 typically first experience a viral-type illness with symptoms ranging from a mild upper respiratory tract infection (eg, pharyngitis, rhinorrhea) to a lower respiratory tract infection (eg, cough, fever), influenza-like symptoms (eg, fever, chills, headache, myalgias), or gastroenteritis (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) (table 2) [11,12]. Loss of smell and taste may also occur, with olfactory loss typically reported early in the course of illness [13]. Dyspnea, if it develops, tends to occur in most patients between four to eight days after the onset of symptoms, although it can occur after 10 days [11]. In patients with less typical symptoms such as isolated rhinorrhea or headache, the likelihood of illness due to COVID-19 should take into account the local prevalence of disease. However, during a pandemic, COVID-19 cannot be ruled out based upon clinical history. Further, even in locations with a high prevalence of COVID-19, the possibility of other etiologies of symptoms should be considered. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Initial presentation' and 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' below.)Availability of testing for SARS-CoV-2 varies widely across regions. If testing capacity and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies allow, we favor widespread use of testing, including drive-through testing, which is important for epidemiologic purposes. However, when resources are limited, SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatients with mild disease may be neither readily available nor appropriate; in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have proposed priorities for testing (table 3). Specific criteria for testing vary by location, institution, and will change over time. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'COVID-19 testing not readily available'.)In patients who are able to undergo testing, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirms COVID-19. However, given sampling variability, viral load variation, and potential false-negative results, a single negative test does not exclude infection and should not guide management [14,15]. Antibody detection has less utility for diagnosis in the acute outpatient setting and should not be used as the sole test to exclude or diagnose COVID-19. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Risk stratification — Our patient-centered continuum of care management approach is based on stratification by risk for developing severe disease and close monitoring for respiratory decompensation. Patients without severe initial symptoms, who are deemed stable enough to not require immediate in-person evaluation, are risk stratified to determine the intensity (frequency and duration) of follow-up.Assess risk for severe disease — Older age and certain chronic medical conditions have been associated with more severe illness and higher mortality with COVID-19 (table 1). We categorize patients as being high, moderate, and low risk for severe disease:●High risk•Age ≥65 years •Residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility•Immunocompromising condition•Chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma•Cardiovascular disease (including hypertension)•Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40 kg/m2)•Diabetes mellitus•Chronic kidney disease (undergoing dialysis)•Cerebrovascular disease•Chronic liver disease•Tobacco use disorder●Moderate risk•Age 20 to 64 years, without any of the specific comorbidities listed above•Age <20 years, with underlying medical conditions other than those listed above●Low risk•Age <20 years, without underlying medical conditionsThese categories are based upon CDC guidance as well as data from published cohort studies, in which older age and many of these underlying conditions were associated with severe disease and death [16-19].Additionally, in the United States, black and Hispanic patients have represented a disproportionately high percentage of hospitalizations and deaths [17,18,20]. The reasons for this finding are unclear but may be related to inequalities in the social determinants of health (eg, access to health care, economic stability, living environment, community experience, education) that predispose to disease. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)It is important to note that although patients who are ≥65 years of age or have poorly controlled chronic medical conditions have a higher risk for hospitalization and death, infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause catastrophic illness in any patient, even among moderate-risk or, less frequently, low-risk patients. In addition, although the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild disease [21,22], infants and children with underlying medical conditions warrant close monitoring; severe disease is most likely to occur in children with underlying medical conditions [23]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?'.)Assess symptom duration and severityTime course and development of dyspnea — For any patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, we establish the illness timeline: the first day symptoms began, the presence of dyspnea, and the day of dyspnea onset. While mild dyspnea is common, worsening dyspnea, particularly dyspnea at rest, and more severe chest discomfort/tightness, are concerning symptoms and suggest the development or progression of pulmonary involvement. The trajectory of dyspnea over the days following its onset is particularly important, as significant worsening and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can manifest soon after the onset of dyspnea; in studies among patients who develop ARDS, progression to ARDS occurred a median of 2.5 days after onset of dyspnea [24-28]. In patients at moderate and high risk for severe illness (table 1), outreach efforts should be focused particularly on the days following the onset of dyspnea to assess for any worsening of respiratory status.It is unclear what percentage of patients with COVID-19 develop dyspnea, as available reports are likely not representative of all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, of patients with symptomatic infection, dyspnea likely develops in only a subgroup of patients. As examples, dyspnea developed in 19 percent of approximately 1000 COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China [29]. However, in a CDC study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the United States, 43 percent of symptomatic adults and 13 percent of symptomatic children developed dyspnea [23]. Among patients who develop dyspnea, it typically begins at least several days after the onset of illness. In one study of 41 hospitalized patients in China, dyspnea developed, on average, eight days after the onset of symptoms [30]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)Dyspnea assessment — Remote assessment of dyspnea should focus on the patient's subjective symptoms, as well as an objective assessment of breathing, including deterioration in respiratory function [31]. We begin by asking if patients have developed any difficulty with their breathing, other than that associated with coughing. If yes, we ask the patient to describe the difficulty in their own words and assess the ease and comfort of their speech (eg, if they can speak comfortably in complete sentences).In addition, we ask questions that provide a more objective assessment of changes in respiratory status, including [31]:●“What activities that you could previously do without difficulty are now causing you to be out of breath?”●""Has this gotten worse over the last one, two, or three days?""●“Are you breathing harder or faster than usual when sitting still?”●“Can you no longer do your usual household activities due to shortness of breath?”●“Does walking cause you to feel dizzy?”We use this assessment to categorize dyspnea by severity:●Mild dyspnea – Dyspnea that does not interfere with daily activities (eg, mild shortness of breath with activities such as climbing one to two flights of stairs or walking briskly).●Moderate dyspnea – Dyspnea that creates limitations to activities of daily living (eg, shortness of breath that limits the ability to walk up one flight of stairs without needing to rest, or interferes with meal preparation and light housekeeping tasks).●Severe dyspnea – Dyspnea that causes shortness of breath at rest, renders the patient unable to speak in complete sentences, and interferes with basic activities such as toileting and dressing.If available, telemedicine consultation with video capability may allow an even better evaluation of respiratory status, by allowing the clinician to observe the patient's respiratory pattern, including the use of accessory muscles of respiration [7].The presence of dyspnea, along with risk factors for developing severe disease (table 1), can be used to guide clinicians in determining whether a patient requires in-person evaluation. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below.)Oxygenation assessment — If a patient with COVID-19 has access to a reliable pulse oximeter at home, and can adequately measure and report the results to the clinician, measurement of oxygen saturation can be used as an additional piece of information to assess their clinical status. Patients are advised to use their pulse oximeter on warm fingers, as readings obtained on cold digits may not be as accurate [32]. In the outpatient setting, we instruct patients to check their oximetry twice daily and inform us if the value drops below 95 percent.●For any patient with an oxygen saturation of ≤94 percent on room air, in-person evaluation is warranted. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)●For patients who have an oxygen saturation of ≥95 percent on room air, the decision on in-person evaluation depends on other clinical features such as severity of dyspnea, risk for severe disease, and assessment of overall acuity. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below.)Oximetry should only be considered within the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation; a normal oxygen saturation level cannot be used to exclude clinically significant respiratory involvement in a patient with concerning symptoms such as progressive or severe dyspnea or high overall acuity level (see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' below). In addition, although normal oximetry can be reassuring, there is no guarantee that respiratory status will not deteriorate as illness progresses.Of note, we do not consider oxygen saturation readings obtained through an application (""app"") on a mobile telephone accurate enough to depend upon for clinical use [33].As with dyspnea, the availability of telemedicine with video capability may allow the indirect assessment of hypoxia by the observation of cyanosis, if present [7].Assessment of overall acuity level — In addition to evaluation of respiratory status, we assess the patient's overall acuity level by asking questions regarding orthostasis, dizziness, falls, hypotension (if home blood pressure measurement is available), mental status change (eg, lethargy, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing), observed cyanosis, and urine output. While mild orthostasis symptoms may be addressed with instruction to increase fluids, mental status changes, falls, cyanosis, hypotension, anuria, and chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are concerning and warrant in-person evaluation. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)Assess home setting and social factors — We assess the ability of patients to monitor their symptoms and to understand the importance of seeking medical guidance should symptoms progress. Patients who lack the ability to self-monitor and self-report may need more intensive staff outreach in order to be adequately managed at home.In addition, in accordance with interim CDC guidelines on home management, we assess if the patient's residential setting is appropriate for home management and recovery [34]; patients managed at home should be capable of adhering to appropriate infection control and isolation precautions for the duration of illness and recovery (including using a separate bedroom if not living alone). Other important home resources include an available caregiver, adequate access to food, and assistance with activities of daily living if necessary. Whether the patient has any household members who are at high risk for severe disease is another consideration (table 1). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.)DETERMINE IF IN-PERSON EVALUATION WARRANTED — Based upon the above assessment, in particular the risk for developing severe disease, dyspnea and oxygenation, and overall acuity level, we determine the urgency and appropriate setting (in-person evaluation versus scheduled telehealth follow-up or self-care) for further management. For those patients who warrant in-person evaluation, we decide if outpatient clinic or emergency department (ED) evaluation is appropriate. (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)While we use the following general criteria to determine the most appropriate clinical setting for in-person evaluation, these criteria are not fixed and will vary by institution, region, and even over time with changing resource availability.In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level — All patients with moderate or severe dyspnea, an initial oxygen saturation <95 percent on room air, or symptoms consistent with higher acuity level warrant in-person evaluation, either in the ED or in an outpatient clinic, depending upon the severity of findings.Criteria for evaluation in ED — We typically refer patients with one or more of the following features to the ED for further management:●Severe dyspnea (dyspnea at rest, and interfering with the inability to speak in complete sentences) (see 'Dyspnea assessment' above)●Oxygen saturation on room air of ≤90 percent, regardless of severity of dyspnea (see 'Oxygenation assessment' above)●Concerning alterations in mentation (eg, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing) or other signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion or hypoxia (eg, falls, hypotension, cyanosis, anuria, chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome)(see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above)Patients meeting the above criteria will typically be admitted to the hospital for inpatient evaluation and management. However, there are no fixed criteria for inpatient hospital admission with COVID-19; criteria vary by country and region. Further, in areas of high infection prevalence, the criteria may also vary with the availability of hospital resources. A lower threshold for hospitalization may be feasible in settings where the burden of disease does not exceed resource availability; in the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel suggests hospitalization for most patients with moderate to severe disease (eg, evidence of lower respiratory tract infection with or without hypoxia) [35]. As our inpatient hospital resources are outpaced by patient volume in the setting of a surge of COVID-19 cases, we have established an outpatient system to closely follow-up and monitor such patients who do not get admitted. However, this approach may not be appropriate in settings with more limited outpatient resources. (See 'Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic' below.)Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic — Patients with one of more of the following features are typically appropriate for evaluation in an outpatient clinic (ideally a dedicated respiratory/COVID-19 clinic if available), provided they do not meet any of the above criteria for evaluation in the ED:●Mild dyspnea in a patient with an oxygen saturation on room air between 91 to 94 percent (see 'Dyspnea assessment' above) ●Mild dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease (table 1) (see 'Assess risk for severe disease' above and 'Dyspnea assessment' above)●Moderate dyspnea in any patient●Symptoms concerning enough to warrant in-person evaluation (eg, mild orthostasis) but not severe enough to require ED referral (see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above)Clinic evaluation — For patients evaluated in an outpatient clinic (if feasible, a respiratory/COVID-19 clinic), we assess the patient's respiratory and circulatory status, and we evaluate for other potentially treatable causes of symptoms [11]. (See 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' below.)Based upon a careful clinical history and physical exam, including vital signs as well as measurements of oxygen saturation at rest and with ambulation, we then determine if the patient is appropriate for self-care, home management with telehealth follow-up, or transfer to the ED. Of note, we have found chest imaging to be of limited utility in the evaluation of most patients with COVID-19 in the outpatient clinic; the patient's clinical presentation is a more important consideration in our management decision. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.)The capability to manage patients in an ambulatory setting (eg, the ability to administer intravenous fluids and medications and to arrange for outpatient follow-up) will vary between institutions and by region and thus influence this decision. In addition, we also consider the patient's home setting and social factors in determining the appropriateness of continued outpatient (clinic and teleheath) management.Home oxygen therapy with oximetry for some patients — For some patients with COVID-19, stable dyspnea, and mild hypoxia, we consider providing home oxygen therapy with home oximetry monitoring if such services are available.In order to consider patients for home oxygen therapy with home oximetry for management of COVID-19, we use the following criteria:●The patient has nonsevere (mild or moderate) dyspnea, with stable, nonprogressive symptoms over several days.●Oxygen saturation is 91 to 93 percent and increases to ≥95 percent with administration of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 liters/minute; we do not titrate to a saturation above 96 percent.●The patient is likely to be adherent with therapy and recommended follow-up.Initiation of home oxygen therapy is not appropriate for patients with new onset of dyspnea and hypoxia early in the onset of illness. Severe pulmonary involvement may develop even among patients at low risk for severe disease, and the need for supplemental oxygen early in the course of illness suggests the need for hospital admission and close monitoring. In addition, in any patient with an increasing oxygen requirement at any point during the course of illness, hospitalization is often indicated.Patients sent home on oxygen therapy require close follow-up; daily clinician telehealth visits are scheduled, and patients are instructed to check oximetry three times daily. Patients receiving home oxygen should contact a clinician if:●Oxygen saturation levels are declining on the established flow rate. In such cases, remote clinician evaluation is performed to determine if in-person reevaluation is warranted. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' above.)●The oxygen saturation level drops below 91 percent, in which case ED evaluation is indicated. (See 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above.)●Worsening dyspnea develops, in which case in-person reevaluation is warranted independent of oximetry results. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' above.)Guidelines on managing critically ill patients with COVID-19 suggest initiating supplemental oxygen when the oxygenation saturation is <90 percent [36]. However, there are no data that inform outcomes using home oxygen and oximetry monitoring in outpatients with COVID-19 or that address optimal oxygen titration in such patients. Additionally, some guidelines suggest that COVID-19 patients with an oxygen saturation of ≤93 percent on room air be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management [35]. Nevertheless, our approach is based upon our clinical experience managing patients with COVID-19 in a setting where inpatient hospital resources are limited due to surging patient volume, and we have established a system to closely follow-up and monitor these patients in the outpatient setting. This approach may not be appropriate in settings with more limited outpatient resources. Ideally, home oxygen therapy and monitoring should be evaluated in the setting of a clinical trial or a rapid-cycle quality improvement project to determine if such an intervention can decrease the use of health care facilities (eg, clinic visits, hospitalizations) without negatively impacting health outcomes.In addition, health insurance coverage restrictions may limit the use of home oxygen therapy for these patients, and out-of-pocket costs may be prohibitive for some patients without health insurance.Some patients warrant transfer from clinic to ED — After initial evaluation in the outpatient clinic, some patients may require more intensive management in the ED. In particular, some patients may require ED management if they have an increased work of breathing or a history of a rapid decline in respiratory function. Additional criteria for ED evaluation are reviewed elsewhere. (See 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above.)Home management without in-person evaluation for others — The majority of patients without moderate or severe dyspnea or hypoxia can remain at home for management without in-person evaluation, if they can reliably report worsened symptoms and can self-isolate for the anticipated duration of illness.The components of home management and counseling for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are discussed elsewhere. (See 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients' below.)Whether such patients warrant telehealth follow-up depends upon their risk for severe disease and the extent of dyspnea (table 1):●Patients who are not at high risk for severe disease, and have no dyspnea are discharged to self-care at home; they do not need in-person evaluation or scheduled follow-up telehealth visits. They receive instructions to contact their clinician with any worsening symptoms.●Patients who are not at high risk for severe disease, and who have mild dyspnea, do not need in-person evaluation but are scheduled for telehealth follow-up visits.●Patients who are high risk for severe disease, and with no dyspnea, are scheduled for telehealth follow-up visits.The frequency and content of follow-up telehealth evaluation is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)Supervised residential care to facilitate isolation — Patients who would be appropriate for home care (with or without telehealth follow-up) but are unable to be adequately managed in their usual residential setting are candidates for temporary shelter in supervised residential care facilities, if available [37].In particular, patients who may be unable to adequately self-isolate (eg, patients living in multigenerational households, patients living with other high-risk individuals (table 1), patients experiencing homelessness) should be provided resources such as dedicated housing units, where available. Disruption of families should be minimized as much as possible. Every attempt should be made to avoid hospitalization simply for the purpose of facilitating self-isolation, as this option is typically not realistically available in regions with widespread disease.Unfortunately, dedicated residential care facilities for COVID-19 patients are not widely available in many countries and regions, and community-based solutions to self-isolation should be explored.OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT AND COUNSELING FOR ALL PATIENTS — When clinically appropriate, it is generally preferable to manage patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 remotely via telehealth visits. (See 'Rationale for outpatient management and remote care' above.)Interim recommendations on the outpatient management of patients with COVID-19 are provided by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, and several academic medical centers [38-41]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)Infection control — With all patients, we reinforce the importance of infection control and self-isolation and provide instructions on the anticipated duration of isolation. These are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.)Symptom management — Symptomatic treatment includes antipyretics and analgesics for myalgias and headaches and maintenance of oral fluid intake. We generally prefer acetaminophen; however, we inform patients that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use is acceptable if symptoms do not respond to acetaminophen. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Some patients with cough or dyspnea may experience symptomatic improvement with self-proning (resting in the prone rather than the supine position) [42]. However, patients are cautioned that progressive respiratory symptoms, particularly worsening dyspnea, should prompt contact with their clinician for further evaluation. (See 'Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea' below.)Managing other potential causes of symptoms — Since symptoms of COVID-19 can overlap with those of many common conditions, it is important to consider other possible etiologies of symptoms including other respiratory infections (eg, influenza, streptococcal pharyngitis, community-acquired pneumonia [CAP]), congestive heart failure, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and even anxiety (table 2) [11].For conditions that can be treated remotely, such as possible streptococcal pharyngitis, mild asthma exacerbations, or mild exacerbations of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), we will often treat without an in-person evaluation but with scheduled daily follow-up telehealth visits. Management of specific medical conditions is discussed in the relevant UpToDate topic reviews.The prevalence of other diseases should also be considered. As an example, in regions where COVID-19 is prevalent and seasonal influenza activity remains high, patients who have symptoms consistent with both conditions should be treated empirically for influenza.We also consider the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community in our determination whether to evaluate the patient in-person; clinical judgement, however, remains the most important consideration in this decision. As an example, in regions where COVID-19 prevalence is high, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize in-person evaluations if possible; remote evaluation and management of mild dyspnea, if clinically appropriate, is preferred. (See 'Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea' below and 'Consider additional causes of worsening dyspnea' below.)Limited role for COVID-19 specific therapy — A number of therapies are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, but none have proven efficacy. Some of these, such as hydroxychloroquine, are available for other indications but remain investigational for COVID-19. Medications for COVID-19 specific therapy should not be prescribed in the ambulatory setting outside of a clinical trial [43]; data are extremely limited, and there are concerns for potential toxicity in an unmonitored setting [44].A catalog of clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org; the list of trials can be filtered by setting (eg, outpatient versus inpatient).Therapies under evaluation for treatment COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Medication management — In general, the patient’s usual home medication regimen is not adjusted, although some changes may be needed. We advise patients who use nebulized medications to avoid their use in the presence of others and to use a metered dose inhaler preparation instead, when possible, to avoid potential aerosolization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Avoiding nebulized medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)'.)If patients already use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) device for management of obstructive sleep apnea, they may continue to use their machine; as with nebulizers, they are advised to use the device only when isolated from others.For patients taking an immunomodulating medication, we consult with the prescribing clinician about the relative risks and benefits of temporarily discontinuing it, which depend upon its indication and the severity of the underlying condition.Thromboprophylaxis may be appropriate for certain patients, such as those at high risk of venous thromboembolism. This is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis'.)Management of medications is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Managing chronic medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Avoiding nebulized medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Immunomodulatory agents' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis'.)Counseling on warning symptoms — We counsel all patients on the warning symptoms that should prompt reevaluation by telehealth visit and in-person, including emergency department (ED) evaluations. These include new onset of dyspnea, worsening dyspnea, dizziness, and mental status changes such as confusion. Patients are educated about the time course of symptoms and the possible development of respiratory decline that may occur, on average, one week after the onset of illness. In addition, we assess the availability of support at home, ensure that they know who to call should they need assistance, and reinforce when and how to access emergency medical services.Patients with obstructive lung disease (eg, COPD or asthma) are specifically advised to closely monitor their respiratory status, and are cautioned not to presume that any worsening shortness of breath is due to an exacerbation of their underlying lung disease.Addressing goals of care — Given the potential severity of COVID-19, all patients should have updated health care proxy and advance directive information in their electronic health record.For patients with significant underlying medical comorbidities and poor health status, COVID-19 may cause catastrophic illness including respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among such patients, those who develop life-threatening complications are likely to have a poor outcome despite the use of aggressive measures such as mechanical ventilation. For patients who are at highest risk of complications and who have the lowest likelihood of survival, the appropriateness of hospitalization and ventilator assistance should be discussed in advance of significant deterioration in clinical condition. For these patients, it may be appropriate to address home palliative care strategies in anticipation of need. Many institutions have palliative care and hospice programs to provide skilled nursing and social work support for patients and families. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Surge capacity and scarce resource allocation' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'End of life issues' and ""Advance care planning and advance directives"", section on 'COVID-19 resources'.)TELEHEALTH FOLLOW-UPFrequency of follow-up — For patients with COVID-19 determined to be appropriate for home management with telehealth follow-up, the frequency of telehealth visits is determined by their risk for severe disease (table 1), severity of respiratory symptoms, and our comfort level with their ability to self-report worsening symptoms. (See 'Home management without in-person evaluation for others' above.)●For most patients, telehealth visits are scheduled on days 4, 7, and 10 (following the onset of clinical illness).●However, for patients in whom we have the highest level of concern, we generally schedule the first follow-up telehealth visit within 24 hours. These include:•Patients aged ≥65 years who have one or more additional risk factors for severe disease (table 1)•Any patient with moderate dyspnea at the time of initial evaluation•Patients who we feel may not reliably report a deterioration in symptomsFor these patients, the frequency of subsequent telehealth visits can be reduced to every other day if the patient remains clinically stable.Repeat assessment of dyspnea and hypoxia — At each telehealth visit, we evaluate a patient's respiratory status, focusing on assessing for new or worsening dyspnea and hypoxia, as these are the most likely indications requiring in-person clinical reevaluation and potential hospitalization. In addition, we assess overall acuity level, ensuring that the patient remains clinically stable enough for remote management. (See 'Dyspnea assessment' above and 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above.)Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea — All patients who develop worsening or more severe dyspnea require further evaluation and management. We use the same criteria for determining whether a patient needs to be evaluated in-person as in our initial evaluation. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' above.)For patients who do not meet criteria for in-person evaluation, and who have potentially treatable causes of dyspnea by clinical history (eg, anxiety, mild exacerbation of congestive heart failure, mild asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations), we typically treat these conditions remotely. However, these patients are closely followed with daily telehealth visits for at least the next several days or until they are improving. The frequency and duration of subsequent follow-up is determined by their clinical course.Dyspnea severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living or cause difficulty with speaking requires an in-person evaluation. Further, new dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease should prompt an in-person evaluation (table 1). The in-person evaluation should occur in the most appropriate clinical setting, depending upon the severity of dyspnea, and may vary by health care system. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' above.)Consider additional causes of worsening dyspnea — In addition, even though some patients with worsening symptoms may be managed remotely, we perform an in-person evaluation if they have complaints suggestive of serious conditions or complications that are not amenable to telehealth management, such as severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; eg, new productive cough, pleuritic chest discomfort), asthma or COPD exacerbation (eg, cough, increasing wheezing), pulmonary embolism (eg, worsening dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis), heart failure (increasing dyspnea, edema, orthopnea) or acute pericarditis (eg, chest pain). This evaluation can take place in a respiratory (COVID-19) clinic or appropriate clinical care setting. Discussion of the evaluation and management of these conditions can be found in the relevant UpToDate topics.In particular, patients with suspected COVID-19 and dyspnea who have underlying obstructive lung disease (including COPD and asthma) present unique management challenges. For such patients, dyspnea may be simply due to an exacerbation of obstruction, and it is not possible to differentiate clinically between an isolated exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease and an exacerbation related to COVID-19. In such cases, a presumptive asthma or COPD exacerbation should be treated with a short course of oral corticosteroids and increased use of short-acting beta agonists. Patients on home oxygen at baseline should be evaluated for increased oxygen requirements. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"".)OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT FOLLOWING INPATIENT OR ED DISCHARGE — After discharge from the inpatient hospital setting or the emergency department (ED), clinician follow-up is warranted, either in outpatient clinic or via telehealth visit. At each encounter after hospital or ED discharge, we reinforce the importance of infection control and provide counseling on the warning symptoms which should prompt reevaluation. (See 'Infection control' above and 'Counseling on warning symptoms' above.)In some cases, patients are discharged home or to supervised residential care from the inpatient hospital setting on low flow oxygen therapy, with oximetry monitoring by telehealth (preferred if available) or visiting nurse. The practice of sending patients home on supplemental oxygen is widely variable, however, and if done warrants close patient monitoring. (See 'Home oxygen therapy with oximetry for some patients' above.)Patients discharged home●Most patients discharged from the inpatient setting require a follow-up clinician visit within one to two days following discharge; depending on their unique clinical and social situation, telehealth visit or in-person outpatient visit may be appropriate.●For those patients evaluated and discharged from the ED and who are felt to need follow-up care, telehealth visits may also be appropriate. The timing of such visits, however, would vary depending upon patient acuity and indication.Patients discharged to supervised residential care for recovery — As part of the continuum of care of patients with COVID-19, temporary housing in supervised residential care facilities may also be appropriate for managing patients discharged from the inpatient hospital setting, as well as those evaluated and discharged from the ED. (See 'Supervised residential care to facilitate isolation' above.)Depending upon the type of facility, the patient's medical acuity, and available resources, telehealth follow-up may be appropriate; the intensity of telehealth follow-up will vary depending upon the indication for housing (eg, solely the need for isolation versus isolation with more acute medical need).SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Our understanding of the spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as optimal management strategies continues to evolve. There are limited data informing outpatient management strategies, and the approach described here is based upon our clinical experience; clinicians should take into account the individual patient's clinical and social circumstances as well as the available resources. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. When possible, we favor a coordinated care management program that includes initial risk stratification, clinician telehealth visits (telephone call or video platform-based), a dedicated outpatient respiratory clinic, and a close relationship with a local emergency department (ED). (See 'General principles' above.)●Patients who live in regions with widespread community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have compatible symptoms are generally managed presumptively as having COVID-19, even if they have not been tested or have an initial negative test result (table 2). (See 'Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing' above.)●On initial evaluation, we assess risk factors for severe disease (table 1), dyspnea severity and duration (and oxygenation status of those with dyspnea), overall level of acuity, and the patient’s home setting to determine who warrants an in-person evaluation at an outpatient clinic or in the ED. The additional criteria we use to make this determination are not fixed and will vary by institution, region, and over time as resource availability evolves. (See 'Risk stratification' above.) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)We typically refer patients with one or more of the following features to the ED for further management (see 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above):•Severe dyspnea (dyspnea at rest, and interfering with the inability to speak in complete sentences)•Oxygen saturation on room air of ≤90 percent, regardless of severity of dyspnea•Concerning alterations in mentation (eg, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing) or other signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion or hypoxia (eg, falls, hypotension, cyanosis, anuria, chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome)We refer patients for evaluation in an outpatient clinic if they have one or more of the following features without any of the preceding features (see 'Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic' above):•Mild dyspnea in a patient with an oxygen saturation on room air between 91 to 94 percent•Mild dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease (table 1)•Moderate dyspnea in any patient•Symptoms concerning enough to warrant in-person evaluation (eg, mild orthostasis) but not severe enough to require ED referralOther patients can generally remain at home for management without in-person evaluation if they can reliably report worsened symptoms and can self-isolate for the anticipated duration of illness. Whether such patients warrant telehealth follow-up depends upon their risk for severe disease and the extent of dyspnea. (See 'Home management without in-person evaluation for others' above.)●When managing outpatients with COVID-19 (see 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients' above):•We reinforce the importance of infection control and self-isolation.

ID:127501,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the WHO and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [1,2]. (See 'Society guideline links' below.) This topic will provide an overview of infection control issues when caring for patients with COVID-19. The use of specific infection control precautions as they pertain to select specialties is presented elsewhere.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)OVERVIEW OF TRANSMISSION — Person-to-person spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, resembling the spread of influenza [3]. However, given the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, recommendations on airborne precautions in the health care setting vary by location. However, airborne precautions are universally recommended when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. (See 'Approach for most patients' below and 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' below.)There is also a risk of transmission when infectious droplets cause environmental contamination that in turn serves as a source of indirect (secondary) transmission when susceptible individuals touch these surfaces and then transfer virus to their mouths or other mucous membranes, such as the nose and conjunctiva, via their contaminated hands. Although the frequency and relative importance of environmental contamination in secondary transmission are unknown, environmental disinfection is an integral component of preventing spread of infection in the hospital and home setting. (See 'Environmental disinfection' below and 'Disinfection' below.) A more detailed discussion of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including the risk of asymptomatic transmission, is discussed in greater detail in a separate topic review. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)INFECTION CONTROL IN THE HEALTH CARE SETTING — Infection control interventions to reduce transmission of COVID-19 include universal source control (eg, covering the nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions), early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with COVID-19, and environmental disinfection. Limiting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. In an early report of COVID-19 in 138 patients from China, it was estimated that 43 percent acquired infection in the hospital setting [4]. In Washington State, suboptimal use of infection control procedures contributed to the spread of infection to 81 residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors in one long-term care facility [5]. Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnelScreening prior to and upon entry into the health care facility●Patients – Patients should be screened for clinical manifestations consistent with COVID-19 (eg, fever, cough, myalgias, sore throat, dyspnea, anosmia/hyposmia) prior to entry into a health care facility. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are presented in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.) Ideally, initial screening should be done over the phone before the patient actually presents to a facility. •Many patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 can be managed from home through telemedicine and will not need to enter the health care setting. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and 'Infection control in the home setting' below.) •For those who require additional evaluation, referral to a respiratory clinic dedicated to the evaluation and management of patients with presumptive COVID-19 is preferable. •However, if a dedicated clinic is not available or the patient requires a higher level of care (for COVID-19 or non-COVID-19-related symptoms), referral to an urgent care or emergency room may be needed. All patients should also be screened for respiratory symptoms upon entry into a health care setting. Separate waiting areas for patients with respiratory symptoms should be designated, with seating spaced such that patients are at least six feet (two meters) apart. Screening upon entry will also identify those who warrant additional infection control precautions. (See 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19' below.)●Visitors – During the COVID-19 pandemic, most hospitals have restricted visitors in the health care setting. Exempted visitors should also be screened for exposure to and symptoms of COVID-19; those with evidence of infection or a known exposure in the last fourteen days should not be allowed to enter the health care setting. ●Health care workers – The approach to screening health care workers entering the health care setting depends upon the institution's policies. In general, health care workers should monitor themselves for fever and symptoms of COVID-19 and stay home if they are ill. In one report of 48 health care workers with confirmed COVID-19 in King County, Washington, 65 percent reported working for a median of two days while exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 [6]. In addition, symptom screening alone did not identify all cases. Thus, additional measures, such as universal use of masks, are recommended. (See 'Universal use of masks' below.)Universal use of masks — All patients and any exempted visitors should be given face coverings upon entry into the health care setting (medical or cloth masks) for universal source control [7]. They should be asked to wear the mask throughout their visit. For patients who are admitted, the mask can usually be removed once the patient is in an appropriate room (eg, single room with the door closed for patients with suspected COVID-19). Additional considerations on the use of masks for patients with COVID-19 in the health care setting are discussed below. (See 'Approach for most patients' below.) Health care workers should also wear a face covering while in the hospital setting. ●A medical mask or respirator must be used when caring for patients. Additional information on the use of masks and other infection control measures when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 is discussed below. (See 'Approach for most patients' below.)●When supplies are limited, cloth face coverings may be reasonable for workers who do not engage in patient care and for providers when they are not involved in direct patient care activities [7]. Hand hygiene should be performed immediately before and after any contact with the face covering, including cloth coverings. Cloth masks should be changed if they become soiled, damp, or difficult to breathe through, and they should be laundered regularly (eg, daily and when soiled). The goal of universal masks is to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from unsuspected virus carriers [8,9]. Although there are no clinical data to support this approach, transmission of COVID-19 from health care workers has been reported [10], and in areas with widespread community transmission, symptom screening alone may not be sufficient, since presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can occur [11,12]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Person-to-person'.)Use of PPE for all patients with respiratory symptoms — All health care workers should use standard, contact, and droplet precautions (ie, gown, gloves, and medical mask), with eye or face protection when evaluating any patient with an undiagnosed respiratory infection, even those who are not under consideration for COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing'.)Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19Approach for most patients — The following infection control precautions should be used for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19:●Type of room – Patients should be placed in a single-occupancy room with a closed door and dedicated bathroom. When this is not possible, patients with confirmed COVID-19 can be housed together [7]. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 should not be in a positive-pressure room.An airborne infection isolation room (AII; ie, a single-patient, negative-pressure room) should be prioritized for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. Additional information on AII rooms, and what to do when these are not available, is found below. (See 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' below.) ●PPE for providers – All providers should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of exposure:•The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that standard, contact, and droplet precautions (ie, gown, gloves, and medical mask) with eye or face protection be used for all personnel entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 [13]. The addition of airborne precautions (ie, respirator) is warranted during aerosol-generating procedures. (See 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' below.) •The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines are similar, but recommend that an appropriate respirator (eg, an N95 respirator) be used instead of a medical mask. However, if the supply of respirators is limited, the CDC acknowledges medical masks are an acceptable alternative (in addition to contact precautions and eye protection) for most encounters, but respirators should be worn during aerosol-generating procedures [7]. (See 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' below.)Goggles or a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face should be used for eye protection; glasses are not sufficient. In addition, cloth face coverings are not considered PPE and should not be worn for the care of patients. Some institutions also require shoe covers for providers caring for patients on a dedicated COVID-19 ward or intensive care unit. In one report, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was widely distributed on floors, and contamination was greater in intensive care units than general wards, although whether this reflected infectious virus and its role in transmitting infection are unknown [14]. Hair covers may be used as well, but are usually not mandatory. Health care workers should pay special attention to the appropriate sequence of putting on (figure 1) and taking off (figure 2) PPE to avoid contamination. The CDC has created video demonstrations of the proper donning and doffing of PPE. Errors in removal of PPE are common, even in trained clinicians, and are associated with contamination of health care workers with pathogens [15]. In a Cochrane review that evaluated methods to increase compliance with donning and doffing of PPE, several interventions appeared to have some benefit in preventing contamination, including the use of CDC protocols and face-to-face training [16].As noted above, when supplies are available, the United States CDC recommends the use of N95 rather than medical masks when caring for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, since there remains uncertainty about the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 has been associated with severe infection, and there are no established treatments or vaccines. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)However, airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not clearly been documented, and several studies support the use of standard, contact, and droplet precautions with eye protection for most patients, with use of N95 respirators for those undergoing aerosol-generating procedures [17-20]. As an example, in a report from Hong Kong in which hospitals implemented empiric isolation, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and use of respirators for all aerosol-generating procedures (regardless of apparent patient risk factors), only 11 of 413 health care workers (2.7 percent) who cared for patients with COVID-19 had unprotected exposure and required quarantine, and none developed infection [17]. ●When patients should wear a mask – Patients should wear a medical mask if being transported out of the room (eg, for studies that cannot be performed in the room). In some institutions, when N95 respirators are not available for routine use, patients with COVID-19 are asked to wear a medical mask during face-to-face contact with health care workers, even when they are in their room, to lower their risk of transmitting infection. When this is done, health care workers must still use appropriate PPE, as described above. Approach in select settingsAerosol-generating procedures/treatments — In patients with COVID-19, aerosol-generating procedures should be avoided when possible to reduce the potential risk of transmission to health care workers. Although there is no consensus as to what constitutes an aerosol-generating procedure, in patients with COVID-19, these procedures typically include (listed alphabetically):●Bronchoscopy (including mini bronchoalveolar lavage)●Cardiopulmonary resuscitation●Colonoscopy●Filter changes on the ventilator●High-flow oxygen●Manual ventilation before intubation●Nasal endoscopy●Noninvasive ventilation ●Open suctioning of airways ●Tracheal intubation and extubation●Tracheotomy●Upper endoscopy (including transesophageal echocardiogram)●Swallowing evaluationSimilarly, inhaled medications should be administered by metered-dose inhaler when feasible, rather than through a nebulizer, to avoid the risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 through nebulization. If avoiding aerosol-generating procedures or use of a nebulizer is not possible, appropriate PPE for health care workers includes use of N95 or other respirators (eg, a powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) that offer a higher level of protection [7,13,21]. Other precautions include eye protection (eg, goggles or a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), gloves, and a gown.Aerosol-generating procedures should take place in an airborne infection isolation room (AII). These are single-patient rooms at negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas, and with a minimum of six air changes per hour (12 air changes per hour are recommended for new construction or renovation). When an AII room is not available, a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) unit can be placed in the room, although it does not compensate for the absence of negative air flow. In one institution, a negative-pressure canopy was used for patients receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), high-flow nasal cannula, and noninvasive ventilation [22].Health care workers and other personnel (eg, environmental services, maintenance) should not enter the room until sufficient time has passed since an aerosol-generating procedure to allow for removal of infectious particles. The rate of removal depends upon the number of air exchanges per hour, as described on the CDC website [23].Specimen collection for respiratory viral pathogens — In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, respiratory specimens for viral pathogens should be obtained in a single-occupancy room with the door closed, and visitors should not be present during specimen collection. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen collection is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure that warrants an airborne infection isolation room.When collecting a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen in a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the United States CDC recommends that health care workers in the room wear an N95 or higher level respirator (or medical mask if a respirator is not available), eye protection (eg, face shield or goggles), gloves, and a gown [24]. As noted above, the CDC prefers a respirator rather than a medical mask when caring for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, as this is a novel virus and there is some uncertainty about airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, when supplies are limited, respirators should be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures. (See 'Approach for most patients' above and 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' above.) When PPE is limited — Limited availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) has complicated medical care of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 (and other transmissible conditions) worldwide. The CDC has made a spreadsheet available that facilities can use to calculate their ""burn rate,"" or average daily usage rate for PPE, using the change in inventory.Optimizing the supply of PPE — In the United States, the CDC offers guidance on optimizing the supply of PPE when sudden increases in patient volume threaten a facility's PPE capacity [25]. Strategies include:●Canceling non-urgent procedures or visits that would warrant use of PPE and favoring home care rather than hospitalization when appropriate. ●Limiting movement outside the patient's room, prioritizing the use of certain PPE for the highest risk situations (eg, aerosol-generating procedures), and designating entire units within a facility to care for known or suspected patients with COVID-19 (ie, cohorting).●Minimizing face-to-face encounters with the patient, which can be done by excluding nonessential personnel and visitors, limiting the number of people who examine the patient, using medications with extended intervals to reduce nursing encounters, and allowing some providers to perform telephone interviews with hospitalized patients. In some facilities, patients can convey needs to providers using tablets or other electronic interfaces, further reducing some in-person interactions. ●Utilizing alternatives to N95s, such as elastomeric half-mask and full-facepiece air-purifying respirators, as well as PAPRs [26-28].In a crisis situation, cautious extended or limited reuse of PPE may be reasonable. As an example, the same medical mask can be used for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients (assuming it is not visibly damaged or soiled) [29]. When this strategy is used, the provider should not touch or remove the mask between patient encounters, since the outside surface is presumably contaminated. If the provider does touch the mask, they must immediately perform hand hygiene. The CDC suggests that masks can be used for 8 to 12 hours [29], whereas the WHO states medical masks can be used for up to six hours when caring for a cohort of patients with COVID-19 [30]. More detailed information on extended use and reuse of medical masks and N95 respirators can be found on the CDC and WHO websites [25,29-31].Decontamination of PPE for reuse — There has been interest in decontamination of personal protective equipment (PPE) for reuse, in particular for N95 respirators. In some centers, decontamination of face shields is also being performed.The CDC and WHO have highlighted several methods for decontamination of respirators when supplies are critically low (crisis standards) [30,32]. These include:●Ultraviolet light – Decontamination with ultraviolet (UV) light was evaluated in the context of the H1N1 influenza pandemic; in experimental models, UV irradiation was observed to reduce H1N1 influenza viability on N95 respirator surfaces at doses below the threshold observed to impair the integrity of the respirator [33-35]. Coronaviruses can also be inactivated by UV irradiation, but comparable studies have not been performed with SARS-CoV-2, and the dose needed to inactivate the virus on a respirator surface is unknown. Nebraska Medicine has implemented a protocol for UV irradiation of N95 respirators in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic based on the dose generally needed to inactivate other single-stranded RNA viruses on surfaces [36]. ●Hydrogen peroxide vapor – Duke University Health System is using hydrogen peroxide vapor for N95 decontamination [37]. Hydrogen peroxide vapor has been observed to inactivate other non-coronavirus single-stranded RNA viruses on environmental surfaces [38,39]. In the United States, The US Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for use of low-temperature vaporous hydrogen peroxide sterilizers, used for medical instruments, to decontaminate N95 respirators [40].●Moist heat – Moist heat has been observed to reduce the concentration of H1N1 influenza virus on N95 respirator surfaces [34]. In this study, moist heat was applied by preparing a container with 1 L of tap water in the bottom and a dry horizontal rack above the water; the container was sealed and warmed in an oven to 65°C/150°F for at least three hours; it was then opened, the respirator placed on the rack, and the container resealed and placed back in the oven for an additional 30 minutes. No residual H1N1 infectivity was found. The optimal time and temperature to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 are uncertain; several studies observed inactivation of SARS-CoV after 30 to 60 minutes at 60°C/140°F [41-43]. Ethylene oxide is also used for decontaminating PPE in some institutions. The CDC cautions that off-gassing from ethylene oxide-treated PPE could be harmful to the wearer [32], but some facilities have taken steps to verify safe concentrations prior to deploying this method. If decontamination of PPE is done, staff should be cautioned to not wear makeup, use lotions or beard oils, or write on masks, as they make decontamination difficult or impossible. Environmental disinfection — To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, environmental infection control procedures should be implemented [7,13,44-46]. In United States health care settings, the CDC states routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 [7]. Products approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for emerging viral pathogens should be used; a list of EPA-registered products can be found here. Specific guidance on environmental measures, including those used in the home setting, is available on the CDC and WHO websites. Many hospitals have implemented enhanced environmental cleaning and disinfection protocols for rooms used by patients with known or suspected COVID-19, and for areas used by health care workers caring for such patients, to prevent secondary transmission from fomites. As an example, adjunctive disinfection methods, such as UV light and hydrogen peroxide vapor, are used in some facilities to disinfect the rooms that have housed or been used for aerosol-generating procedures on patients with COVID-19. Environmental services workers who are cleaning areas potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 should be trained to conduct the cleaning in appropriate PPE [7]. Workers should be fit tested and trained to wear N95 respirators and face shields (or PAPRs) when cleaning patient rooms that are or have been occupied by persons with known or suspected COVID-19 or have been used for aerosol-generating procedures on patients with COVID-19. Environmental services workers can use droplet and contact precautions, plus eye protection (surgical mask, face shield or goggles, gown, and gloves) when cleaning areas used by health care workers who are caring for COVID-19 patients.The importance of environmental disinfection was illustrated in a study from Singapore, in which viral RNA was detected on nearly all surfaces tested (handles, light switches, bed and handrails, interior doors and windows, toilet bowl, sink basin) in the airborne infection isolation room of a patient with symptomatic mild COVID-19 prior to routine cleaning [47]. Viral RNA was not detected on similar surfaces in the rooms of two other symptomatic patients following routine cleaning (with sodium dichloroisocyanurate). Of note, viral RNA detection does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus. The role of environmental contamination in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Environmental contamination'.) Patients who have had an exposure to COVID-19 — Some patients who require hospitalization for a reason unrelated to COVID-19 may have had close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, including during the 48 hours prior to that patient developing symptoms. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)In this setting, clinicians should use infection control precautions similar to those used for patients with suspected disease, as described above; however, such patients should not be cohorted or share a room with patients who have COVID-19. (See 'Approach for most patients' above.) Patients should continue infection control precautions specific for COVID-19 for the duration of their quarantine (14 days after their last contact with the patient).Some institutions are testing asymptomatic patients after an exposure. However, a negative test does not rule out subsequent development of infection with SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, infection control precautions should be continued for the duration of the incubation period, despite a negative result. INFECTION CONTROL IN THE HOME SETTING — Home management is appropriate for patients with mild infection who can be adequately isolated in the outpatient setting [44,48,49]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)Management of such patients should include instructions on how to prevent transmission to others. Isolation at home — Outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (including those awaiting test results) should stay at home and try to separate themselves from other people and animals in the household [50]. They should also avoid having visitors enter the home. Patients should wear a face cover if they must be in the same room (or vehicle) as other people. Some authorities recommend a medical mask [51]; however, when supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) are limited, a cloth face cover should be used. Detailed information on the use of cloth face covers can be found on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. A caregiver can also wear a face cover when around the patient, but if a cloth face cover is used, it is unclear how much protection it provides to the wearer. Other steps to reduce transmission in the home include [51-54]:●Limiting the number of caregivers and, if possible, using caregivers who do not have risk factors for developing severe disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)●Having patients use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available. ●Minimizing patients' exposure to shared spaces and ensuring shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as an air conditioner or an opened window. When sharing spaces cannot be avoided, patients and caregivers should try to remain six feet (two meters) apart, if possible, and face covers should be used.●Ensuring caregivers perform hand hygiene after any type of contact with patients or their immediate environment. In addition, caregivers should wear gloves when touching the patient's blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, and urine. ●Educating caregivers on how to carefully put on and take off PPE. As an example, caregivers should first remove and dispose of gloves, and then immediately clean their hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. After that, the face cover (if used) should be removed, and the caregiver should again perform hand hygiene. ●Instructing family members to avoid sharing dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with the patient. After the patient uses these items, they should be washed thoroughly; disposable gloves should be worn when handling these items. In addition, thermometers should not be shared, or should be thoroughly disinfected before use by other household members.More detailed recommendations on home management of patients with COVID-19 can be found on the World Health Organization and CDC websites [44,45,55]. Disinfection — Disinfection of frequently touched surfaces is also important. In the home, high-touch surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected daily. These include tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remote controls, handles, desks, toilets, and sinks. For disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and most common Environmental Protection Agency-registered household disinfectants are thought to be effective. More detailed information on how to clean and disinfect, including guidance for patients, is found on the CDC and World Health Organization websites [52,56].DISCONTINUATION OF PRECAUTIONS — The decision to discontinue infection control precautions for patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 should be made in consultation with experts in infection prevention and control and/or public health officials. If patients are ready to be discharged home prior to meeting criteria for discontinuation of precautions, they can be sent home with instructions to self-isolate until they meet either test-based or non-test-based criteria. Once infection control precautions/home isolation are discontinued, patients should still continue to follow public health recommendations for wearing face covers in public settings where social distancing is difficult to achieve. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.) Special considerations for health care workers are found below. (See 'After infection' below.)Patients with confirmed infectionSymptomatic patients — Test-based and symptom-based strategies can be used to inform when infection control precautions should be discontinued in patients with COVID-19 [57-59]. Symptom-based strategies allow for discontinuation of precautions after symptom resolution and specific time intervals, whereas a test-based strategy requires resolution of symptoms and two negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on sequential respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart. A detailed discussion of testing is found in a separate topic review. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'NAAT (RT-PCR) to diagnose current infection'.)The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests the following test- or symptom-based strategies [57,59]. A discussion about which strategy to use is found below. (See 'Deciding whether to use a test- or non-test-based strategy' below.)●When a test-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue infection control precautions specific for COVID-19/home isolation when there is: •Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications AND•Improvement in respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) AND•Negative results of a US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens)There is no clear guidance as to when repeat testing should be performed. We obtain the first test once the patient has met the criteria for the symptom-based strategy. If the first test is positive, a second test should be obtained after 72 hours. If negative, the second test is obtained 24 hours later. ●When a symptom-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue infection control precautions specific for COVID-19/home isolation when the following criteria are met:•At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared AND•At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms [eg, cough, shortness of breath])When a symptom-based strategy is used, it may be reasonable to continue precautions or extend the period of isolation beyond the 10 days in select patients, such as those who are likely to remain infectious for longer periods of time (eg, immunocompromised patients), as well as certain employees (eg, those who work with vulnerable populations). This should be determined on a case-by-case basis. A seven-day duration was previously used, but was updated based on evidence on duration of viral shedding [60]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.)Protocols in other countries and at specific institutions may differ; as an example, when a non-test-based strategy is used, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests home isolation for patients with documented COVID-19 be continued for at least two weeks after symptom resolution [52]. Information on other institutional protocols is found elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)Asymptomatic patients — Some patients may have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without any symptoms when they were tested. Similar to patients with symptoms, the United States CDC has provided recommendations for test- and non-test-based strategies [57,59]. The non-test-based strategy uses time since diagnosis.●Time-based strategy – If a time-based strategy is used, infection control precautions specific for COVID-19/home isolation can be discontinued when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 test, as long as there was no evidence of subsequent illness. If symptoms developed, the symptom-based strategy should be used. (See 'Symptomatic patients' above.)When using a time-based strategy, it may be reasonable to continue precautions or extend the period of isolation beyond the 10 days in select patients, such as those who are likely to remain infectious for longer periods of time (eg, immunocompromised patients), as well as certain employees (eg, those who work with vulnerable populations).●Test-based strategy – If a test-based strategy is used, infection control precautions specific for COVID-19/home isolation can be discontinued when patients have negative results of a US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens).A discussion about which strategy to use is found below. (See 'Deciding whether to use a test- or non-test-based strategy' below.)Deciding whether to use a test- or non-test-based strategy — The decision to use a test- or non-test-based strategy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, since each strategy has potential limitations. As an example, the use of non-test-based strategies may not prevent all instances of secondary spread. These strategies that use time since diagnosis or time since illness onset and recovery are based upon findings that transmission is most likely to occur in the early stage of infection. However, data are limited, particularly in immunocompromised patients [57,58]. By contrast, a test-based strategy may unnecessarily prolong the need for infection control precautions and isolation, since there have been reports of prolonged detection of RNA without direct correlation to viral culture. In a German study of nine patients with mild infection, no infectious virus was found in respiratory specimens after day 8 of symptoms despite the detection of high titers of viral RNA through the third week, suggesting prolonged shedding of viral RNA is not necessarily reflective of transmissibility [60,61].Test-based and non-test-based strategies differ for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and are detailed above. (See 'Symptomatic patients' above and 'Asymptomatic patients' above.)A more detailed discussion of viral shedding and the period of infectivity is found in a separate topic review. (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity')Suspected cases with negative initial testing — In some patients, initial testing is negative, but there is still suspicion for COVID-19. In this setting, a second test should be performed, and infection control precautions should be continued pending the result. When two tests are negative, precautions can often be discontinued; however, if concern for COVID-19 remains high, such as in a patient with consistent clinical symptoms and an exposure to a person with known or suspected COVID-19, infection control precautions should be continued at least until criteria for discontinuation of precautions using a symptom-based strategy are met. (See 'Symptomatic patients' above.)The accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 testing have not been systematically evaluated, and a single negative test may not sufficiently exclude the diagnosis. In addition, the quality of nasopharyngeal swab collection may vary. Additional information on diagnostic testing is presented elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Suspected cases when testing was not performed — In some cases, testing for COVID-19 may not be accessible, particularly for individuals who have a compatible but mild illness that does not warrant hospitalization. In areas where community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is widespread, these patients are often treated presumptively for COVID-19 (eg, home isolation, supportive care) and the decision to discontinue transmission-based precautions should be made using the symptom-based strategy described above. (See 'Symptomatic patients' above.)ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONSReturn to work for health care workersAfter potential or known exposure — For health care workers who have had a potential exposure to COVID-19, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided guidelines for work restriction and monitoring. The approach depends upon the duration of exposure, the patient's symptoms, whether the patient was wearing a medical mask, the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) used by the provider, and whether an aerosol-generating procedure was performed. Some local health departments allow asymptomatic health care workers to return to work following an exposure if they adhere to cough and hand hygiene, wear a medical mask while at the health care facility until 14 days after the exposure, and monitor daily for fever or respiratory symptoms, the presence of which would prompt immediate self-isolation [62]. After infection — For health care workers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, decisions about return to work should be made in the context of the provider's local circumstances (eg, availability of testing, staffing shortages) [63]. Test- or non-test-based strategies can be used. More detailed information regarding criteria for return to work, as well as return to work practices and work restrictions, is found on the CDC website.Long-term care facilities — Similar to other health care settings, certain measures should be used for all patients, visitors, and providers entering the facility. These include symptom screening and use of face covers for everyone entering the facility, regardless of symptoms. In addition, standard, contact, and droplet precautions, as well as eye protection, should be used for any patient with an undiagnosed respiratory infection [64]. A more detailed discussion of infection control precautions can be found above. (See 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel' above and 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19' above.)Additional strategies to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection in long-term care facilities include limiting visitors except in rare circumstances (eg, compassionate care situations), screening staff daily for symptoms before entering the facility, discontinuing use of common dining rooms and canceling all group activities, and monitoring the clinical status and vital signs of all residents at least three times per 24-hour period, including daily temperature measurements [65-67]. Since older adults with COVID-19 may not show typical symptoms (eg, fever or respiratory symptoms), the CDC recommends that a temperature >100.0°F, as well as the presence of atypical symptoms, such as worsening malaise, new dizziness, or diarrhea, prompt isolation and further evaluation for COVID-19 [64].Once an outbreak has occurred, the facility should identify an area to care for residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and dedicated staff should be assigned to work only in that area of the facility. Roommates who have been exposed but are asymptomatic should not be placed with another roommate until 14 days after their exposure, assuming they have not developed symptoms or had a positive test. If the facility has airborne infection isolation rooms (ie, single-patient, negative-pressure rooms), they should be prioritized for patients who require aerosol-generating procedures (eg, patients with tracheostomies requiring nebulizer treatments). When this is not possible, a private room should be used, with a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available.Additional information on infection control in long-term care facilities can be found on the CDC website. Dialysis — Similar to other health care settings, dialysis centers should identify patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection (eg, fever, cough) before they enter the treatment area. If a patient has suspected infection when they arrive, they should be placed in a private room. If that is not possible, they should wear a mask and be separated by at least six feet (two meters) from the nearest patient. Staff should wear PPE as described above. A more detailed discussion of infection control in dialysis centers is presented in a separate topic review. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis'.)Role of serologic testing — Serologic tests, as soon as generally available and adequately evaluated, should be able to identify patients who have a prolonged illness (eg, greater than 14 days) and a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, as well as those who had previous infection. However, these tests are not useful for assessing the presence of infection in an exposed patient and, until their sensitivity and specificity are further assessed, they should not be used for determining the use of infection control precautions. Additional information on serologic testing is presented elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Serology to identify prior infection'.) Preventing infection in the community — To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, individuals should be advised to practice diligent hand hygiene, as well as respiratory hygiene (eg, covering their cough), and to avoid close contact with ill individuals, if possible. In addition, residents should greet each other without contact, refrain from shaking hands, and avoid gathering in groups. If community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is present, residents should be encouraged to practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave home. In some locations, face coverings are advised in public settings. Additional measures are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.) SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). (See 'Introduction' above.)●Limiting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This includes universal source control (eg, covering the nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions), early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with COVID-19, and environmental disinfection. (See 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel' above and 'Infection control in the health care setting' above and 'Infection control in the home setting' above.)●Person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, resembling the spread of influenza. However, given the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, airborne precautions are recommended in certain settings. Thus, in hospitalized patients, the following types of infection control precautions should be used for those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (see 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19' above):•Patients should ideally be placed in a single-occupancy room with a closed door and dedicated bathroom; however, when this is not possible, patients with confirmed COVID-19 can be housed together. An airborne infection isolation room (ie, a single-patient negative-pressure room) should be prioritized for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. (See 'Approach for most patients' above and 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' above.)•Standard, contact, and droplet precautions (ie, gown, gloves, and medical mask), with eye or face protection (eg, face shield or goggles) should be used for all personnel entering the room. An N95 respirator should be used for all aerosol-generating procedures. In the United States, an N95 respirator is preferred for all settings, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that medical masks are an acceptable alternative when PPE is limited. (See 'Approach for most patients' above and 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' above and 'When PPE is limited' above.)•Health care workers should pay special attention to the appropriate sequence of putting on (figure 1) and taking off (figure 2) PPE to avoid contamination. (See 'Approach for most patients' above.)•When availability of PPE is limited, strategies to preserve the supply include canceling non-urgent procedures or visits that would warrant use of PPE and prioritizing the use of certain PPE for the highest risk situations. Cautious extended or limited reuse of PPE and decontamination of PPE for reuse can also be considered in select situations. (See 'When PPE is limited' above.)●In some hospitalized patients, initial testing is negative, but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains high. In this setting, additional testing should be performed to help inform the decision to continue transmission-based precautions. (See 'Suspected cases with negative initial testing' above.)●To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, environmental infection control procedures should be implemented in both health care and home settings. Products approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for emerging viral pathogens should be used; a list of EPA-registered products can be found here. (See 'Environmental disinfection' above and 'Disinfection' above.)●Outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (including those awaiting test results) who do not require hospitalization should stay at home and separate themselves from other people and animals in the household. Other strategies to help prevent transmission within the household include use of face covers, not sharing items such as dishes, towels, and bedding, and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces. (See 'Infection control in the home setting' above.)●In symptomatic patients with confirmed COVID-19, test-based or symptom-based strategies can be used to inform when transmission-based precautions should be discontinued. If patients are ready to be discharged home prior to meeting criteria for discontinuation of precautions, they can be sent home with instructions to self-isolate until the criteria are met. (See 'Discontinuation of precautions' above.)●In patients who were presumptively diagnosed with COVID-19 based upon a compatible illness but were not tested, the decision to discontinue transmission-based precautions should be made using the symptom-based strategy. (See 'Suspected cases when testing was not performed' above.)●Some patients may have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without any symptoms when they were tested. For such patients, a test- or time-based strategy can be used to discontinue infection control precautions, as long as there was no evidence of subsequent illness. (See 'Asymptomatic patients' above.)●Additional infection control considerations for health care workers and long-term health care facilities are discussed above.

ID:127582,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation,"INTRODUCTION — Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for COVID-19 because they are immunosuppressed and have frequent contact with the health care system. There is also a theoretical risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) with organ transplantation, although no cases of organ transplant-transmitted infection have been described to date.This topic reviews aspects of COVID-19 that are specific to solid organ transplantation, including screening prior to transplantation, distinct clinical features, managing immunosuppression, and important drug interactions. Other aspects of COVID-19 care are discussed separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)RISK OF TRANSMISSIONPotential for donor-derived infection — The risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from an organ donor to a recipient is theoretical and based upon the detection of viral RNA in organs that can be transplanted (eg, lung, heart, kidney, intestine) and in other sites (ie, blood, urine) [1-4]. While it is clear that viable infectious virus can be cultured from the lung and other parts of the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, additional study is needed to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 detected at extra-respiratory sites is intact, replication competent, and therefore transmissible by non-lung organ transplantation.To date, no organ donor-derived infections have been reported. Similarly, bloodborne transmission has not been reported and is not expected; both the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 viremia and its magnitude are low [1,4-6]. (See ""Blood donor screening: Medical history"", section on 'SARS-CoV-2 (no evidence of transfusion-transmitted infection)'.)Posttransplantation risk — It is not known whether solid organ transplant recipients are at higher risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population. However, chronic immunosuppression may lower the infectious dose needed to cause COVID-19 and impair adequate immune control once infection is established. Organ transplant recipients also have frequent contact with the health care system and are therefore potentially more likely to be exposed to the virus.Like other immunosuppressed persons, solid organ transplant recipients may shed greater amounts of virus for longer durations than otherwise healthy hosts. Thus, they may be more likely to spread infection to others. Further data is needed to confirm these theories and to quantify viral dynamics and transmission risks in the solid organ transplant population.DEFERRAL OF NONURGENT TRANSPLANTATION — To minimize the risk of infection and conserve hospital resources, elective transplantation (eg, living-donor kidney transplantation) and nonurgent, deceased-donor transplantation are being deferred at some transplant centers where the community prevalence of COVID-19 is high and/or where resources (personnel, hospital or intensive care unit [ICU] beds, operating rooms, other equipment) are limited.Life-saving transplantation continues to be performed, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have classified organ transplantation as a tier 3b activity: Do not delay, on the basis of assessment of the potential risks compared with known benefits [7].PRETRANSPLANTATION SCREENING — All organ donors and potential recipients should be screened for COVID-19 prior to organ procurement. This is necessary to prevent initiation of potent induction immunosuppression in the context of active infection and for the safety of the organ transplant recipients (who are typically potently immunosuppressed in the immediate posttransplant period) and the organ procurement team.Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; primarily used to detect active infection) is the main assay used for screening. The utility of serology (primarily used to detect past infection) for pretransplant screening has not been established. However, once the performance characteristics of serology are more well established among solid organ transplant recipients, serologies may become a helpful adjunct assay. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Donor screening — All donors should be screened for COVID-19 [8]. We generally perform a careful history, obtain chest imaging, and perform microbiologic testing. In all cases the decision to proceed to transplantation should take into account the urgency of the transplant and the risk and benefits in each individual. As general principles:●Donors with known or suspected active COVID-19 based on exposure, symptoms, or chest imaging should generally be declined or deferred.●Donors with known or suspected COVID-19 within the past 28 days should generally be declined or deferred.●Donors who have been exposed to individuals with known or suspected COVID-19 in the recent past (eg, within the past 21 days) should generally be declined or deferred. However, if such a donor tests negative for COVID-19, transplantation can be considered in selected cases (eg, if transplantation is urgently life-saving).●Donors should also be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR performed on respiratory tract samples. The approach to screening varies among institutions and by the organ to be transplanted:•For deceased organ donors (especially lung donors), it is recommended to sample both the upper respiratory tract (eg, nasopharyngeal swab) and the lower respiratory tract (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage) when screening, based upon data suggesting increased sensitivity of lower tract (ie, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) specimens compared with upper tract specimens.•For other donors, screening for COVID-19 should be performed on a single upper respiratory tract sample, at a minimum. The need to obtain serial samples and/or lower respiratory tract samples varies among centers and is often individualized.For living donors who test positive for COVID-19 or for deceased donors who have recovered from COVID-19, the optimal deferral period is not known. Based upon the mean duration of viral shedding (20 days) [9], the American Society of Transplantation (AST) suggests waiting at least 28 days from the time of diagnosis and complete resolution of symptoms (if living donor) before organ donation/procurement be considered [8]. As knowledge of COVID-19 accumulates, screening recommendations are expected to evolve.Candidate screening — All potential organ transplant recipients should be screened for COVID-19 by history, chest imaging, and microbiologic testing prior to transplantation. Although data is lacking, COVID-19 can be asymptomatic, and there is concern that the intense immunosuppression given at the time of transplantation could result in rapidly progressive and potentially fatal COVID-19:●All potential organ recipients should be screened for COVID-19 prior to transplantation. At most transplant centers this includes RT-PCR of an upper respiratory tract specimen (eg, nasopharyngeal swab), a thorough symptom and exposure history, and chest imaging. A chest radiograph is usually sufficient for patients who lack respiratory symptoms, however, for those with respiratory symptoms (even if minor), computed tomography (CT) of the chest is appropriate.●Candidates with active COVID-19 and/or signs or symptoms of other respiratory illnesses should generally be deferred for transplantation.For patients with active COVID-19 and patients who screen positive, the optimal deferral period is not known. The AST suggests waiting until all symptoms have resolved and at least two RT-PCRs for SARS-CoV-2 have been negative [8]. As with any transplantation, the risk of transplantation must be balanced with the risk of not transplanting a patient with acute or recent COVID-19.PREVENTION — Preventive measures for organ transplant recipients are similar to those defined for the general population (eg, social distancing, careful hand and respiratory hygiene). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Prevention'.)One additional consideration is that solid organ transplant recipients who have COVID-19 may shed greater amounts of virus for longer durations than nonimmunosuppressed patients. Thus, a longer duration of isolation and/or testing to document viral clearance to help reduce the likelihood of spreading the infection to others may be needed. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)ACTIVE COVID-19 IN SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTSClinical presentationClinical features — Clinical features of COVID-19 among solid organ transplant recipients are variable and similar to those in nonimmunocompromised patients. However, fever appears to be less common, possibly as a consequence of the effects of immunosuppressive therapy on the systemic inflammatory response [10-12]. As an example, in two case series of solid organ transplant recipients in New York City, fever was a presenting symptom in only 58 to 70 percent [11,12]. Lymphopenia is also common and may be more profound than in nontransplant patients with COVID-19 [12]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Severity of illness — It is unclear if solid organ transplant recipients have a higher risk of severe disease compared with nontransplant patients if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many solid organ transplant recipients have medical comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) that have been associated with more severe COVID-19 disease and mortality, which makes the attributable impact of solid organ transplantation on disease severity difficult to assess.Limited data suggest that solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection may have severe disease, similar to that described in non-solid organ transplant patients with serious underlying comorbidities [11,12]. As an example, in the study of 90 solid organ transplant recipients cited above, 24 percent had mild disease (outpatient care only), 46 percent had moderate disease (admitted to general inpatient floor), and 30 percent had severe disease (mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], or death) [11]. At a median of 20 days, the mortality rate was 18 percent. Compared with patients who had mild to moderate disease, those with severe disease were older and more likely to have hypertension or active cancer, but other comorbidities associated with severe disease in the general population were not significantly different between the groups. In addition, there were no significant differences between the groups in the types of organ transplant or the median time from transplant to COVID-19 diagnosis.Risk factors for severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)Effect of immunosuppression — The impact of immunosuppression in the solid organ transplant population on COVID-19 disease severity remains unclear. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 appears to represent an interplay between direct virally mediated injury and the associated host response, with experimental data suggesting that a dysregulated and hyperintense immune response may mediate more severe disease [13]. Since immunosuppressive agents modulate several aspects of the host immune response, the severity of COVID-19 infection could potentially be affected by the type, combinations, and intensity of immunosuppression. As an example, certain immunosuppressive medications can either directly (eg, lymphocyte-depleting antibodies) or indirectly (eg, antimetabolites) cause lymphopenia, which is a reported risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. Specific agents that have been independently associated with decreased immune responses to vaccines (eg, mammalian [mechanistic] target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors, mycophenolate) could theoretically impair the ability to develop an adequate immune response to natural infection. Conversely, some experimental data suggest that mTOR inhibitors may have some biological activity against SARS-CoV-2 [14]. Additional studies are required to determine the impact of specific immunosuppressive agents on the course of COVID-19 infection.Diagnosis — Criteria for testing for COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients are similar to those for the general population. However, clinicians should have a higher index of suspicion of infection, as is generally recommended for immunosuppressed individuals:●For solid organ transplant recipients with suspected COVID-19 who are hospitalized, testing is recommended.●For solid organ transplant recipients with mild symptoms, optimal practice is not defined. While some favor testing all such patients based upon the potential for rapid disease progression, others favor making a clinical diagnosis and monitoring the patient at home. Thus, the decision is often individualized based upon local COVID-19 prevalence, available resources, and patient-provider preference.●Routine screening of asymptomatic solid organ transplant recipients is not recommended.Specific testing methods are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing'.)ManagementGeneral considerations — The approach to the management of acute COVID-19 infection in solid organ transplant recipients is similar to that for nontransplant patients. All specific antiviral agents being used for the treatment of COVID-19 are investigational. Use of these agents is generally limited to hospitalized patients who have or are at risk for severe disease. When possible, treatment should be given as part of a clinical trial.These issues are discussed in more detail separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Adjusting immunosuppression — Adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen are necessarily individualized, based upon disease severity, the specific regimen used, type of organ transplanted, time posttransplant, and the risk of acute allograft rejection [11].Although the optimal approach is not defined, we usually reduce immunosuppression in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection (eg, those requiring hospitalization):●As a first step, we often reduce or hold the antimetabolite (eg, mycophenolate mofetil/sodium), particularly for patients with lymphopenia (eg, absolute lymphocyte count <700 cells/mL).●We generally continue the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) because CNIs inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 pathways, which may contribute to the development of the severe, dysregulated immune response seen in some patients with severe COVID-19.●We typically avoid use of high-dose glucocorticoids as these agents have been associated with prolonged viral shedding and may predispose to poor outcomes, based on experience with other epidemic coronaviruses. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)However, in all cases the decision to reduce immunosuppression must be carefully weighed against the risk for acute rejection, particularly in transplant recipients who generally require high levels of maintenance immunosuppression (eg, lung or heart recipients). The optimal management of immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection is not known, and data are limited to case reports and series [11,12,15,16].There are also concerns that COVID-19 infection itself may increase the risk for acute rejection and that an overly intense inflammatory host immune response might contribute to overall disease severity. Thus, attenuating the immune response by maintaining low-dose immunosuppression could theoretically be beneficial. In addition, experimental data suggest that certain immunosuppressive agents such as mTOR inhibitors may have some biological activity against SARS-CoV-2 [14]. Additional studies are required to confirm these findings.Additional guidance on adjusting immunosuppression in transplant recipients with active infection can be found in the following topic reviews:●(See ""Kidney transplantation in adults: Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy"", section on 'Patients who develop an infection'.)●(See ""Maintenance immunosuppression following lung transplantation"", section on 'Monitoring and adjusting maintenance therapy'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'Issues for ventricular assist devices and cardiac transplantation'.)Recommendations from specific medical societies are listed separately. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Drug-drug interactions — A number of experimental COVID-19 therapies have potential drug-drug interactions with medications that are commonly used among solid organ transplant recipients. In particular, medications that prolong the QT interval (eg, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin) should be used with caution since many solid organ transplant recipients are taking a CNI, which may also prolong the QT interval. In addition, care should be taken with protease inhibitors (such as lopinavir and ritonavir), which can reduce the metabolism and significantly increase blood levels of CNIs (table 1). SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

(See 'Introduction' above.)●There is a theoretical risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) from an organ donor to a recipient based upon the detection of viral RNA in organs that can be transplanted (eg, lung, heart, kidney, intestine), although donor-derived infections have not been reported to date. (See 'Potential for donor-derived infection' above.)●Because of this risk and the potential for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to health care providers, all solid organ donor and transplant candidates should be screened for COVID-19 by history, chest imaging, and microbiologic testing.

ID:127762,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines,"INTRODUCTION — The pneumonia associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or nCoV) may lead to respiratory failure with profound hypoxemia requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The rapidly spreading pandemic may result in utilization of all available intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators in individual institutions and regions. Repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term use for days or weeks to ventilate COVID-19 patients or other patients requiring mechanical ventilation has been proposed, but is somewhat unprecedented. Furthermore, anesthesia machines have only been rarely used to administer inhalation anesthetics during prolonged ventilation. This topic will address management of short-term or long-term intensive care ventilation with an anesthesia machine, emphasizing this use for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [1]. Airway management and anesthetic care of patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection for surgical procedures, including preventing infection of anesthesia personnel or contamination of anesthesia machines and equipment are addressed in a separate topic. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)Use of standard ICU ventilators and ventilation of critically ill patients COVID-19 patients are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.)Other details regarding obstetric and critical care of patients with COVID-19 infection, and general medical management are available in additional topics:●(See ""Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumented delivery)"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)PREVENTION OF ANESTHESIA MACHINE CONTAMINATION — Preventing contamination of the external parts of the anesthesia machine, its breathing system and ventilator, and its connection to the gas analyzer and attached monitoring equipment while in use for patients with COVID-19 is described in another topic. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Protection of anesthesia equipment'.)Contamination of an anesthesia machine during use as an intensive care ventilator for patients with known COVID-19 infection is more likely than use during a surgical procedure because of the duration and extent of machine exposure. Based on studies of other coronaviruses, it is estimated that infected patients exhale 0 to 100,000 virus particles per 30 minutes, or as many as 4,800,000 particles per day [2]. However, a single filter with a viral filtration efficiency (VFE) of 99.9999 percent (ie, a good mechanical pleated filter at the expiratory limb) would allow 4.8 of these particles, on average, to pass. If two filters are used such as a heat and moisture exchange filter (HMEF) containing an electrostatic filter placed at the airway plus a mechanical pleated filter placed at the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit, the combined VFE is very high (perhaps as high as 99.99999999 percent), rendering contamination of the anesthesia machine unlikely, even when used for multiple days (with fresh filters each day). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Contamination of the internal components of the anesthesia machine'.)LOCATIONS FOR ANESTHESIA MACHINES — Location(s) selected for use of anesthesia machines to ventilate COVID-19-positive patients will be institution-dependent due to considerations such as layout of selected hospital area(s), location of rooms with negative pressure capabilities, and availability of sources of electrical power, high-pressure oxygen, and medical air [1]. Personnel considerations include availability of anesthesia personnel to manage ventilation with anesthesia machines, and convenience for critical care consultants. When multiple anesthesia machines are used in a single location, the compressed gas pipelines should be assessed to ensure that supply is adequate to meet consumption if supplying an area where multiple anesthesia ventilators are using high fresh gas flows (FGFs). The electrical supply should also be assessed to ensure that circuits will not be overloaded, particularly in areas outside the operating room (OR).Availability of compatible connections from the scavenger system to waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets or medical vacuum outlets is another necessary consideration if inhalation anesthetic agents are to be administered using the anesthesia machine. However, gas scavenging is not necessary if inhalation agents are avoided. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' below and 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below.)Institutional options for location of anesthesia machine ventilators may include intensive care unit (ICU) rooms, the presurgical holding area, post-anesthesia care units (PACUs), or individual ORs [1]. In some institutions, it may be possible to treat two or more COVID-19 patients in the same OR if there are multiple sources of oxygen and medical air, and if anesthesia personnel (ie, clinician anesthesiologists, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists [CRNAs], Certified Anesthesiologist Assistants [CAAs]) are deployed most easily in an OR setting. Notably, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) guidelines for repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation recommend that anesthesia professionals be immediately available at all times to manage and monitor the anesthesia ventilator (and administration of inhalation anesthetic agents, if used), as well as to assist with respiratory care (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator), regardless of the locations(s) for the anesthesia machines [3,4]. (See 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' below and 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' below.) LONG-TERM VENTILATION WITH ANESTHESIA MACHINES — The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidance for anesthesia care team members regarding repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator) [3,4]. These professional societies recommend that anesthesia professionals be immediately available at all times to manage and monitor the anesthesia ventilator. Professional staff who are not anesthesiologists (eg, some intensivists, as well as respiratory therapists, and intensive care unit [ICU] nurses) are experts in respiratory care, but are not familiar with anesthesia machines. Use of anesthesia machine ventilators for patients who require mechanical ventilation for a period of time, but who are not COVID-19-positive, may be a good option for optimal use of institutional resources.Limited data regarding duration of mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 patients suggest that two or more weeks are often necessary. Collaboration with critical care teams throughout this period is clearly essential to achieve optimal respiratory care, and to manage other systemic problems in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.)Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators — Data are limited regarding the capabilities of anesthesia machine ventilators developed by various manufacturers to mimic ICU ventilator parameters or reliably provide continuous mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods of time. Although newer anesthesia ventilators incorporate multiple controlled and assisted modes of ventilation that are nearly identical to ventilators in the ICU, there are several important technical issues that are unique to anesthesia machines, which must be considered during use for long-term ventilation.Adjusting humidifcation of inspired gases●The need to adjust FGF to prevent condensed water accumulation in the breathing circuit. The ability to alter FGF and the fraction of exhaled gas rebreathed is a key feature distinguishing an anesthesia ventilator from an ICU ventilator. FGF is typically reduced during general anesthesia to conserve inhalation anesthetic agent. A FGF that is lower than minute ventilation increases rebreathing of exhaled gas, which is humidified by the body. The reaction of rebreathed carbon dioxide (CO2) with the CO2 absorbent produces additional humidity within the circuit. Experience to date indicates that when an anesthesia machine is in long-term use as an ICU ventilator, reducing FGF leads to excessive humidity in the breathing circuit, and the need to change CO2 absorbent frequently (see ""Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions"", section on 'Carbon dioxide absorbent exhaustion or toxicity'). This additional humidity can be clinically significant leading to water condensation within the breathing circuit that can increase resistance to gas flow through the system, interfere with sensors such as respiratory gas analyzers and flow sensors, and increase risk for coinfections. For these reasons, significant accumulations of water in the breathing circuit (typically expiratory limb) must be emptied. Accumulated water should be emptied carefully and while wearing full PPE, because it may be contaminated with virus. Condensers and water traps may be added to some breathing systems to aid in managing excessive humidity [2].To prevent buildup of humidity and decrease the use of CO2 absorbent, it is recommended that FGF be set to equal minute ventilation initially (approximately 6 to 8 L/minute in adult patients). Generally, it should be apparent in one to two hours if excess moisture is accumulating in the breathing circuit. If it is, FGF can be increased incrementally (eg, by 0.5 to 1 L/min) until humidity is controlled. Alternately, FGF can be set higher (eg, 1.5 times minute ventilation) initially, and can then be reduced in increments of 500 mL/minute with vigilant monitoring for the appearance of humidity in the inspiratory limb. Once FGF exceeds 1.5 times minute ventilation, there is little rebreathing, and increasing FGF further does not provide any advantage and wastes compressed gas (oxygen and medical air).●The need for long-term humidification and warming of inspired gases. Critical care patients should inspire warm humidified gases to prevent drying of secretions and respiratory epithelium. At the low FGFs typically used in the operating room (OR), inspired gas is humidified due to rebreathing [5,6], and also by the release of heat and humidity by the reaction of CO2 with the absorbent [7]. The presence of condensate in the inspiratory hose indicates that the inspired gas is at least partially humidified.However, at the high FGFs that are necessary to manage condensed water accumulation during prolonged ventilation with an anesthesia machine, a heat and moisture exchange filter (HMEF) may be necessary. The HMEF should be placed at the endotracheal tube connection to the breathing circuit (after the Y-piece and the gas sampling port). This HMEF will ensure that adequate humidity is maintained in the lungs and will also filter viral particles. However, an HMEF at the airway is prone to obstruction from moisture or secretions and should be inspected no less frequently than every hour, and changed when obstruction is a concern, or once every 24 hours. Devices that actively humidify inspired gas are not recommended. They cause problems with ventilation and monitoring since anesthesia machines are not designed to handle large amounts of condensed water within their breathing circuit. Unique safety issues●The need to place a second high-quality viral filter (typically a pleated mechanical filter that does not need heat and humidity exchange properties) on the expiratory limb of an anesthesia machine breathing circuit used for ventilation of a COVID-19 patient, even if an HMEF filter is placed at the airway (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Contamination of the internal components of the anesthesia machine'). The filter at the expiratory limb can likely be left in place for a longer period of time than the filter placed at the airway; however, there are no data predicting filter performance over time. Since many institutions have filter shortages, these expiratory limb filters should only be changed as necessary.  ●Potential need to prevent accidental administration of inhalation anesthetic agents. If there are no plans to administer inhalation anesthetics to achieve patient sedation, then the vaporizers for the volatile agents should be removed or drained. Also, the nitrous oxide (N2O) cylinder and pipeline hoses should be removed. These measures ensure that inhalation anesthetic agents are not accidentally administered. However, some institutions with inadequate supplies of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are commonly used in the ICU may consider emergency use of low doses of a volatile inhalation anesthetic agent (isoflurane or sevoflurane), as explained below. (See 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below.)●The potential for the CO2 absorbent to expire. The inspired CO2 and the color indicator of the CO2 absorbent should be monitored frequently. The absorbent should be replaced if inspired CO2 increases (eg, above 5 mmHg) or if the CO2 absorbent color indicates that it has become exhausted. If ventilation must be interrupted to change the absorbent, the patient should be temporarily ventilated by an alternative means. Furthermore, potential reactions with the CO2 absorbent may occur if a volatile anesthetic agent is employed and the absorbent becomes dried by the FGF. (See ""Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions"", section on 'Carbon dioxide absorbent exhaustion or toxicity'.)●Potential need to adjust the scavenger system of the anesthesia machine. If an anesthesia machine is used outside of an OR, it may not be possible to connect its scavenger system to a compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal or vacuum outlet. Waste anesthetic gas disposal outlets are typically only found in operating or procedure rooms, and waste gas hoses from the anesthesia machine may not be compatible with medical vacuum outlets found elsewhere. Waste anesthetic gas scavenging is only necessary when use of inhalation anesthetic agents is planned (see 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below). Importantly, if a scavenger system with a reservoir bag (closed scavenger system) is not connected to vacuum, it can cause high PEEP and peak pressures due to backup of scavenged gas into the breathing system. Options include:•If no inhalation anesthetic agents are to be used (picture 1):-Disconnection of the scavenger system from the hoses coming from the breathing system and ventilator -Removal of the scavenger reservoir bag (if it is a closed scavenger system) •If inhalation anesthetic agent will be used, scavenging is required. Connection of the scavenger system to suction in locations outside the OR (eg, the ICU) may be difficult if the connections are incompatible. In such cases, alternate tubing or connectors, or connection adapters may be used. When higher than usual FGFs are used, scavenger suction must be adjusted upward to ensure proper function. ●The need for periodic performance of an anesthesia machine self-test (ie, power-up test) approximately every 24 to 72 hours. The ASA and anesthesia machine manufacturers recommend a pre-use check every day prior to using the machine in the OR setting. For prolonged use, most manufactures have stated that this can be done approximately every three days. Experience has shown that problems such as inaccurate ventilation delivery and monitoring may occur when anesthesia machines are not restarted and checked at three-day intervals.Notably, an alternative means of ventilation is necessary (eg, with a manual resuscitator or a second ventilator) while the machine is powered down, restarted, and checked. A step-by-step procedure should be followed to ensure that all equipment is available to prevent patient lung de-recruitment, as well as to limit spillage of breathing circuit gas and other contaminants and protect anesthesia personnel during this process (refer to APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and the ASA's Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machines as an ICU Ventilator) [3,4]. A suggested procedure has been developed by the APSF and ASA (refer to the APSF/ASA Procedure for Supporting Patients during the Anesthesia Machine Self-Test) [8].●The need to periodically check the breathing circuit for possible kinking or compression since, unlike ICU ventilators, there is no articulating arm on the anesthesia machine that can hold the breathing circuit up off the bed.●The need to minimize potential for errors in setup of anesthesia machines, initiation of controlled ventilation, and respiratory monitoring in locations outside of the OR suite, ideally by deploying multiple machines of the same model within any one hospital unit (eg, ICU, post-anesthesia care unit [PACU]). Adjusting ventilatory settings●The need to understand how specific capabilities differ among individual anesthesia machines:•Newer anesthesia machines have ventilator capabilities similar to modern ICU ventilators, with more flexible settings that can deliver more modes of ventilation (including assist modes) compared with older models. Newer models with compliance compensation and tidal volume delivery unaffected by changes in fresh gas flow (FGF) are generally preferred (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators). •Newer machines are also equipped with breathing systems and ventilators that can be sterilized between patients, and are better choices for those with COVID-19 infection.•Older models can be reserved for surgical patients and for ventilation of patients without COVID-19 respiratory disease, if feasible.●The need to understand how settings and performance of anesthesia machine ventilators differ from those of ICU ventilators when making adjustments in ventilator settings:•Anesthesia machines do not default to pressure support of extra breaths in control modes. Care must be taken to add this when changing ventilator modes.•Anesthesia machines may have a lower peak inspiratory flow rate. Negative airway pressure occurs if the patient inhales faster than the maximum inspiratory flow rate provided by the ventilator.•Anesthesia machines are milliseconds slower to respond to patient effort because of the circle breathing system interposed between the patient and anesthesia ventilator [9], which can cause more hyperventilation in an air-hungry patient.•Inspiratory time is not directly set on an anesthesia machine. Most anesthesia machines do not provide direct control of inspiratory time; instead this is controlled indirectly by setting the I:E ratio and the respiratory rate.Options for setting the anesthesia machine ventilator include:-In volume control modes (including synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation [SIMV]), the inspiratory flow rate can be increased by increasing tidal volume or by decreasing inspiratory time (accomplished by reducing the I:E ratio or by increasing the respiratory rate). -In pressure control or support modes, the inspiratory flow rate can be increased by lowering the flow trigger level for ventilation (which increases the speed at which pressure-support is provided), or by decreasing the rise time of pressure support (which increases the inspiratory flow rate). On Draeger anesthesia machine ventilators, the flow trigger level is called ""Trigger L/min"" and the rise time is called ""Tslope."" On GE Healthcare Systems anesthesia machine ventilators, the flow trigger level is called ""Flow Trigger"" and the rise time is called ""Rise Rate."" However, lowering the flow trigger level may cause extra mis-triggered breaths in some patients; if these occur, the flow trigger level must be increased. On some Draeger machine ventilators, the maximum inspiratory flow is governed by a facility-level setting, although on-site clinical engineers can adjust this parameter to allow a maximum inspiratory flow of 75 L/min.●Potential need to modify default ventilator parameters and alarm settings. Default settings on the anesthesia machine, such as minute ventilation, airway pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels, and alarms, may be modified to better match those of an ICU ventilator. The default alarm volumes should be set to maximum.●The potential for the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration in the breathing circuit to be lower than the set oxygen gas concentration on the anesthesia machine (FgO2). Because of the rebreathing that occurs in an anesthesia machine circle breathing circuit, inspired oxygen concentration depends on both the ratio of oxygen to air in the delivered fresh gas (determined by the FGF setting) and the total FGF (which influences the amount of rebreathing). Thus, inspired oxygen concentration must be continuously monitored (see 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' below). Notably, when total FGF is very high (eg, >12 L/minute), a FiO2 of 100 percent cannot be delivered if the total FGF is higher than the maximum possible flow of oxygen. In some older hospitals, anesthesia machines deployed to non-ICU locations outside the OR may not be able to draw their theoretical maximum total FGF.●Potential need to modify oxygen utilization by the anesthesia machine ventilator if oxygen supply is limited by factors such as [1]:•Delay in delivery of liquid oxygen to the hospital•Excessive use of oxygen by the hospital, such that the oxygen vaporizers (where liquid oxygen is converted to gas oxygen) become covered in ice, resulting in inefficiency •Inability of the flow in an oxygen pipeline branch to keep up with demand due to the number of ventilators, anesthesia machines, and oxygen flowmeters on that branch in certain hospital locations.The ability of anesthesia machines to draw less oxygen than the patient's minute ventilation can be a substantial advantage in such situations, particularly those machines with electrically powered piston or turbine ventilators that do not consume oxygen. Anesthesia machines with bellows ventilators typically use oxygen as the drive gas that compresses the bellows; these consume oxygen at a rate approximating minute ventilation (in addition to using oxygen in the FGF). However, anesthesia machines with bellows ventilators may be modified by a qualified clinical engineer to be powered by compressed air instead of oxygen [10], a modification made when the machine is not in use (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators). Monitoring long-term ventilation — An anesthesia professional should be available to start ventilation and subsequently monitor degree of moisture accumulation, inspired and expired CO2, filter integrity, overall anesthesia machine function, and effectiveness of ventilation [1]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.) The APSF/ASA guidelines address additional maintenance and monitoring requirements during use of anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation of COVID-19 patients (refer to APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions - Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator) [3,4]. These additional considerations are necessary due to use of extra filters which may become clogged, the tendency to accumulate condensed water in the breathing circuit, and risks for aerosolizing droplets containing COVID-19 virus.Documentation of this enhanced monitoring of continuous and intermittent parameters is necessary. This may be achieved automatically if the anesthesia machine connected to the hospital network for recording to the electronic medical record [1], or manually using a template developed for this purpose by the anesthesia team.Patient monitoring — Baseline monitored parameters (eg, tidal volume, plateau pressure (Pplat), minute ventilation) should be recorded when ventilation is initiated. If spirometry is available, saving or photographing the baseline tracings and reference loops may aid in later diagnosis of filter obstructions.Continuously monitored parameters (with preset alarms) that are checked and recorded each hour include:●Inspired oxygen concentration. ●Inspired and expired CO2.●Inspiratory pressure.●Tidal volume and respiratory rate. ●Low oxygen pressure alarm. If an anesthesia machines with an oxygen-driven bellows is being used, a low oxygen pressure alarm triggered by each inspiration may indicate a high demand on the institutional central oxygen pipeline system, particularly when multiple ventilators are simultaneously in use. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)Intermittently monitored ventilatory and physiologic parameters include:●Check Pplat at least once every four hours, and after each change in PEEP or tidal volume, to ensure that it is ≤30 cm H2O. Measurement of Pplat is accomplished during a 0.5 second inspiratory pause. Unlike many ICU ventilators, anesthesia machines do not have a control to manually initiate an inspiratory pause. On an anesthesia machine ventilator, a 0.5 second inspiratory pause can be generated by temporarily setting the mode to volume ventilation with the tidal volume that the patient has been receiving, at 10 breaths per minute, with an I:E ratio of 1:2 and a 50 percent inspiratory pause (Tpause or TIP). (See ""Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults"", section on 'Plateau pressure'.)●Check the flow readings approximately every four hours, since these may become less accurate over time. If the machine is equipped with both inspiratory and expiratory flow sensors, a gradual increase in the difference between inspired and exhaled tidal volume measurements usually indicates that a startup test is needed to recalibrate the breathing system flow sensors.●Confirm there is no leak around the endotracheal tube cuff every hour because such a leak produces respiratory droplets and aerosolized viral particles. A leak around the endotracheal tube cuff typically manifests as measured exhaled tidal volume that is lower than measured inhaled tidal volume, and a flow-volume loop that does not close [11]. At low FGFs a bellows ventilator may progressively empty, while the reservoir bag will progressively deflate in machines with a piston or turbine ventilator. High FGF compensates for small leaks, obscuring these indicators of breathing circuit volume.Machine maintenance and monitoring — Intermittent inspection and maintenance of proper anesthesia machine and breathing circuit function including:●Inspect the breathing circuit hoses and water trap for excessive condensed water every hour. If fluid has accumulated in the breathing circuit and is threatening to impede ventilation, it must be emptied. Plans should be in place to ventilate the patient while the circuit is emptied. Further, proper collection and disposal procedures for contaminated water and personal protective equipment (PPE) for personnel performing this procedure are necessary when handling fluids potentially contaminated with virus.High peak airway pressure during volume ventilation or low tidal volume during pressure ventilation are signs of profound obstruction of the filters placed at the airway or in the expiratory limb. Decreased peak expiratory flow and prolongation of expiratory flow are earlier indications of partial obstruction of one of these filters [11]. Significant obstruction of either filter also creates additional PEEP, with a difference between the set and actual PEEP that can be seen in the airway pressure when the expiratory limb filter is obstructed. Notably, this additional PEEP is invisible when the airway filter is obstructed since airway pressure is measured downstream of that filter. ●Inspect the breathing circuit hoses for possible kinking or compression every hour as well.●Inspect the airway and expiratory limb breathing circuit filters every hour to check for excessive humidity or secretions that may cause obstruction of gas flow. The airway filter is at highest risk. Obstructed filters must be changed. Otherwise, filters are typically replaced every 24 hours. ●Check the CO2 absorbent color and inspired CO2 values every hour to ensure that the absorbent is still functioning properly and does not need to be exchanged. This is especially important if lower FGFs are being used.●Confirm that an anesthesia machine startup test was performed once every 24 to 72 hours (refer to the APSF/ASA Procedure for Supporting Patients during the Anesthesia Machine Self-Test) [8]. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)USE OF INHALATION ANESTHETICS FOR SEDATION — Institutions with shortages of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation may consider using low doses of a potent volatile inhalation anesthetic agent (isoflurane or sevoflurane). The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidelines for such emergency use (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [12]. However, administration of inhalation anesthetic agents for prolonged periods in critically ill patients is not encouraged, as scant safety data exist for this use and there are some disadvantages, as noted below. (See 'Advantages and disadvantages' below.)Intravenous sedative-analgesic regimens that are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation are discussed in separate topics:●(See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal"".)●(See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects"".)●(See ""Pain control in the critically ill adult patient"".)Dosing to achieve sedation — Administration of low doses of either sevoflurane (eg, 0.5 to 1.4 percent) or isoflurane (eg, 0.2 to 0.7 percent) for long-term sedation is reasonable if use of a volatile inhalation anesthetic agent becomes necessary.Factors influencing dosing include whether the targeted level of sedation is achieved with satisfactory patient comfort. The presence of ventilator dyssynchrony may necessitate deepening the anesthetic/sedation level. Conversely, if hypotension is present, lightening of the anesthetic/sedation level is necessary. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Clinical effects'.)When the decision is made to allow the patient to awaken, the anesthetic vaporizer is turned off, and fresh gas flow (FGF) is increased. Washout of anesthetic agent is rapid and predictable, with patients typically able to respond to commands and be assessed for extubation within 10 to 15 minutes. (See ""Emergence from general anesthesia"", section on 'Inhalation agents'.)Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics — In addition to the suggested monitoring noted above for use of anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation (see 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above), specialized monitoring requiring the constant presence of an anesthesia provider is necessary during administration of inhalation anesthetic agents.Patient monitoring during sedation●Continuously monitored parameters include:•End-tidal anesthetic concentration, with titration of anesthetic dosing to the minimal effective end-tidal concentration. The low-level and high-level alarms on the anesthetic gas monitor should be enabled.•Exhaled end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) to monitor for the possibility of malignant hyperthermia (which severely and acutely increases ETCO2), and to help manage ventilation. (See 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above.)•Temperature, since potent inhalation anesthetics lower core temperatures (see ""Perioperative temperature management"", section on 'Anesthetic effects on thermoregulation'), and to monitor for the possibility of malignant hyperthermia (which acutely increases temperature to >102°F [38.9°C).●Other monitored parameters include:•Hemodynamic monitoring per usual standards for care of individual critically ill patients, and may be useful to evaluate cardiovascular responses to an inhalation anesthetic agent. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Hemodynamic monitoring' and ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Cardiovascular effects'.)•Serum creatinine and liver function tests are obtained at intervals that may be daily (in consultation with the critical care team), as a check for renal or hepatic dysfunction during long-term administration of a volatile anesthetic agent.Equipment monitoring during sedation — Intermittent inspection and maintenance of anesthetic administration includes:●The fill level of anesthetic vaporizers is checked every hour since rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents occurs due to high FGF; refill when anesthetic level <20 percent full.Liquid anesthetic use can be estimated. One mL of a liquid volatile anesthetic agent yields approximately 200 mL of gas anesthetic (specific values are 195 mL for isoflurane or 184 mL for sevoflurane). Thus, at 10 L/min of FGF, the liquid volatile anesthetic consumption is approximately 30 mL/hour if a 1 percent inhaled concentration is delivered. Most vaporizers hold approximately 200 ml of liquid, so refills would be needed multiple times each day even at the lower doses noted above for use of isoflurane or sevoflurane for patient sedation during mechanical ventilation. (See 'Dosing to achieve sedation' above.)One way to reduce consumption of volatile anesthetic agent is to reduce FGF. Another way to agent consumption is to use an anesthetic reflector device such as the AnaConDa or Mirus [13-18]. These devices are designed for administration of inhalation anesthetic agents using a traditional intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator, but are not approved for use in the United States. The device is placed between the Y-piece and patient, where it vaporizes small amounts of anesthetic liquid, and absorbs most of the exhaled anesthetic, which is then re-inhaled on the next breath (much like a heat and moisture exchanger [HME] absorbs and conserves humidity). Notably, room contamination still occurs with use of these devices unless a scavenging system is employed [16-18]. ●Proper functioning of the scavenging system is confirmed when administration of inhalation anesthetics is initiated, then every 24 hours or after major changes in the rate of FGF. Anesthetic vapor is consumed rapidly and the scavenger system requires high vacuum flow when high FGF is used. Advantages and disadvantages — Advantages and disadvantages of specific agents (sevoflurane versus isoflurane) are discussed separately. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Sevoflurane' and ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Isoflurane'.)Potential advantages and disadvantages for long-term use of sevoflurane or isoflurane for sedation of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 induced respiratory failure include:●Advantages•Effective sedative effects, with rapid onset and offset allowing easy titratability. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Sedation and anesthesia'.)•Minimal metabolism and likely minimal organ toxicity. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Properties and delivery"", section on 'Metabolism'.)•Readily available.•Potentially advantageous respiratory effects-Bronchodilation, with attenuation of bronchospasm and decreased airway responsiveness. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Respiratory effects'.)-Pulmonary anti-inflammatory effects observed during short-term anesthetic administration for surgical procedures. This may minimize the extent of lung injury by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release [19-22]. (See ""One lung ventilation: General principles"", section on 'Intravenous versus inhalation anesthetics'.)•Dose-dependent muscle relaxation during mechanical ventilation. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Skeletal and smooth muscle relaxation'.)●Disadvantages•Scant safety data regarding use of inhalation anesthetic agents for prolonged periods in critically ill patients. However, long-term sedation with sevoflurane or isoflurane has been employed in some nations for sedation of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other critical illness, without evidence of renal or hepatic injury [22-26].•Rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents occurs due to high FGF. Thus, hourly inspection of the anesthetic vaporizer fill level and analysis of end-tidal anesthetic concentration are particularly important. (See 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' above.)•Potential for inadequate sedation, particularly if the patient has received a neuromuscular blocking agent. Thus, the patient and anesthesia machine and anesthetic vaporizer must be carefully monitored. •Potential difficulty with connection of the anesthesia machine scavenger systems to compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets in settings outside an operating room (OR). (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)•Lack of familiarity among non-anesthesia personnel caring for critically ill patients with ARDS (eg, intensivists, nurses, respiratory therapists) regarding use of anesthesia machines to administer volatile inhalation anesthetic agents, dosing of these agents, and potential pitfalls that may occur during their administration (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [12]. •Need for constant presence of anesthesia personnel as recommended by the ASA and APSF (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [12].  •Potentially undesirable systemic effects of a potent volatile anesthetic agent in critically ill patients, including:-Cardiovascular effects (eg, myocardial depression and vasodilatory properties that result in dose-dependent reductions in blood pressure and cardiac output). (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Cardiovascular effects'.)-Adverse respiratory effects including airway irritation, particularly with the more pungent agents such as isoflurane, as well as respiratory depression. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Respiratory effects'.)-Cerebral effects (eg, dose-dependent cerebral vasodilation, with blunting of cerebral autoregulation by uncoupling cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism, thereby increasing CBF and intracranial pressure (ICP). Thus, patients with known or suspected elevations in ICP are not candidates for sedation with inhalation anesthetic agents. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Effects on cerebral physiology'.)•Although rare, potential for potent inhalation anesthetic agents to cause malignant hyperthermia. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Malignant hyperthermia (volatile inhalation agents)'.)COLLABORATION WITH CRITICAL CARE CONSULTANTS — Collaboration and coordination with critical care clinicians is essential for care of COVID-19 patients regarding decisions for long-term ventilation of these patients using an anesthesia ventilator, and for management of comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular and renal complications, coinfection with sepsis) [27-31]. These issues are discussed in detail in separate topics:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Contamination of an anesthesia machine, its breathing system and ventilator, and its connection to the gas analyzer is more likely during use as an intensive care ventilator compared with use during surgical procedures for patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or nCoV) infection because of the duration and extent of machine exposure. However, if two filters are used (eg, a heat and moisture exchange filter [HMEF] containing an electrostatic filter placed at the airway plus a mechanical pleated filter placed at the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit), the combined viral filtration efficiency (VFE) is very high, rendering contamination of the anesthesia machine unlikely, even when used for multiple days (with fresh filters each day). (See 'Prevention of anesthesia machine contamination' above.)●Locations selected for use of anesthesia machines to ventilate COVID-19 patients will be institution-dependent depending on layout of selected hospital area(s), location of rooms with negative pressure capabilities, availability of sources of high-pressure oxygen and medical air, availability of compatible connections from the scavenger system to waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets when inhalation anesthetic agents are used, and availability of anesthesia personnel to manage the anesthesia machines. (See 'Locations for anesthesia machines' above.)●The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidance for repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator). Although newer anesthesia ventilators incorporate multiple controlled and assisted modes of ventilation that are nearly identical to ventilators in the intensive care unit (ICU), several important technical issues are unique to anesthesia machines during such use (see 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above):•The age and specific capabilities of individual anesthesia machines (newer anesthesia machines have more flexible capabilities and can deliver more modes of ventilation).•The need to adjust fresh gas flow (FGF) to prevent condensed water accumulation in the breathing circuit.•The need for long-term humification and warming of inspired gases.•The need for two high-quality viral filters (one at the airway and on the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit).•The need to understand how settings and performance of anesthesia machine ventilators can be different from those of ICU ventilators.•Potential need to modify default ventilator parameters and alarm settings.•The potential for the carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbent to expire.•The potential for the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration in the breathing circuit to be lower than the set oxygen gas concentration on the anesthesia machine (FgO2).•The need to prevent accidental administration of inhalation anesthetic agents, if inhalation anesthetics are not administered to achieve patient sedation.•Potential need to adjust the scavenger system to prevent backpressure in the breathing system if the anesthesia machine is used outside of an operating room (OR).•The need for periodic performance of an anesthesia machine self-test (ie, power-up test) approximately every 24 to 72 hours.•The need to periodically check the breathing circuit for possible kinking or compression.•The need to minimize potential for errors in setup of anesthesia machines, initiation of controlled ventilation, and respiratory monitoring in locations outside the OR, ideally by deploying multiple machines of the same model within any one hospital unit.●An anesthesia professional should be available to start and monitor ventilation and overall anesthesia machine function (see 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above):•Continuously or intermittently monitored patient parameters (with preset alarms) that are checked and recorded each hour include (see 'Patient monitoring' above):-Inspired oxygen concentration -Inspired and expired CO2-Inspiratory pressure-Tidal volume and respiratory rate-Low oxygen pressure alarm-Check Pplat at least once every four hours, and after each change in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or tidal volume-Check the flow readings approximately every four hours -Confirm there is no leak around the endotracheal tube cuff every hour •Intermittently machine monitoring includes inspection of (see 'Machine maintenance and monitoring' above):-Breathing circuit hoses and water trap for excessive condensed water every hour.-Breathing circuit hoses for possible kinking or compression every hour-Airway and expiratory limb breathing circuit filters every hour for excessive humidity or secretions-CO2 absorbent color and inspired CO2 values every hour -Documentation of anesthesia machine startup test performance once every 24 to 72 hours ●Although intravenous sedative-analgesic regimens are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation, institutions with shortages of these intravenous agents may consider using low doses of a potent volatile inhalation anesthetic agent for long-term sedation (ie, sevoflurane [0.5 to 1.4%] or isoflurane [0.2 to 0.7%]; refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients).

ID:127926,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability,"INTRODUCTION — A novel coronavirus was identified in late 2019 that rapidly reached pandemic proportions. The World Health Organization has designated the disease caused by the virus (SARS-CoV-2) as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Individuals with COVID-19 may have a number of coagulation abnormalities (in the direction of an underlying hypercoagulable state), raising questions about appropriate evaluations and interventions to prevent or treat thrombosis. Interim guidance has been published by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and frequently asked questions are posted on the websites of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC).This topic reviews evaluation and management of coagulation abnormalities in individuals with COVID-19.Separate topics discuss the following:●General management – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●Critical care – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)●Pregnancy – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●Anesthesia – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is incompletely understood.Virchow's triad — Hypercoagulability can be thought of in terms of Virchow's triad (see ""Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis"", section on 'Virchow's triad'). All three of the major contributions to clot formation apply to severe COVID-19 infection:●Endothelial injury – There is evidence of direct invasion of endothelial cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, potentially leading to cell injury. Other sources of endothelial injury include intravascular catheters and mediators of the acute systemic inflammatory response such as cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-6) and other acute phase reactants [1]. The contribution of complement-mediated endothelial injury has been suggested [2]. (See ""The endothelium: A primer"" and ""Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention"" and ""Acute phase reactants"".)●Stasis – Immobilization can cause stasis of blood flow in all hospitalized and critically ill patients, regardless of whether they have COVID-19.●Hypercoagulable state – A number of changes in circulating prothrombotic factors have been reported or proposed in patients with severe COVID-19 [3,4]:•Elevated factor VIII •Elevated fibrinogen•Circulating prothrombotic microparticles•Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)Very elevated levels of D-dimer have been observed that correlate with illness severity; D-dimer is a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin indicating augmented thrombin generation and fibrin dissolution by plasmin. However, high D-dimer levels are common in acutely ill individuals with a number of infectious and inflammatory diseases. Likewise, antiphospholipid antibodies, which can prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), are common in viral infections, but they are often transient and do not always imply an increased risk of thrombosis. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' below and 'Clinical features' below.) Coagulation abnormalities — The predominant coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 suggest a hypercoagulable state and are consistent with uncontrolled clinical observations of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (see 'VTE' below). This state has been termed thromboinflammation or COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) by some experts [5,6]. It appears to be distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), though DIC has been reported in severely affected patients.Laboratory findings were characterized in a series of 24 selected patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (intubated) who were evaluated along with standard coagulation testing and other assays including von Willebrand factor (VWF) and thromboelastography (TEG) [3]:●Coagulation testing•Prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT normal or slightly prolonged•Platelet counts normal or increased (mean, 348,000/microL)•Fibrinogen increased (mean, 680 mg/dL; range 234 to 1344)•D-dimer increased (mean, 4877 ng/mL; range, 1197 to 16,954)●Other assays•Factor VIII activity increased (mean, 297 units/dL)•VWF antigen greatly increased (mean, 529; range 210 to 863), consistent with endothelial injury or perturbation•Minor changes in natural anticoagulants-Small decreases in antithrombin and free protein S-Small increase in protein C ●TEG findings•Reaction time (R) shortened, consistent with increased early thrombin burst, in 50 percent of patients•Clot formation time (K) shortened, consistent with increased fibrin generation, in 83 percent•Maximum amplitude (MA) increased, consistent with greater clot strength, in 83 percent•Clot lysis at 30 minutes (LY30) reduced, consistent with reduced fibrinolysis, in 100 percentTesting in this study was performed on arterial blood because the patients had arterial catheters in place, but venous blood can be used. Heparinase was included since most patients were receiving low molecular weight (LMW) heparin. Other studies have reported similar findings consistent with a hypercoagulable state, including very high D-dimer, VWF antigen and activity, and factor VIII activity [4,7]. One study suggested that patients with COVID-19 have higher platelet counts than patients with other coronavirus infections [8]. Early case series, including a series of 183 consecutive patients from Wuhan, China, suggested that thrombocytopenia and prolongation of the PT and aPTT were more marked [9-12]. It is not clear why these results differed somewhat from later findings of less severe PT and aPTT prolongation. One possible explanation is that these patients were sicker, perhaps because earlier in the pandemic the disease was not recognized as quickly, resulting in delays in patient presentation and/or treatment.Another explanation for an isolated prolonged aPTT is the presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LA) (see ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Causes of prolonged aPTT'). Two studies have found a high rate of LA in patients with prolonged aPTT (50 of 57 tested individuals [88 percent] and 31 of 34 tested individuals [91 percent]) [13,14]. The presence of an LA may lead to an artifactual prolongation of the aPTT but does not reflect an increased bleeding risk; patients with an LA should receive anticoagulation if indicated. (See 'Management' below.) Some of the markers of deranged coagulation (eg, D-dimer) appear to correlate with illness severity. D-dimer is often increased, sometimes markedly, in individuals with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and those in the intensive care unit (ICU). Principles of TEG and interpretation of TEG tracings are illustrated in the figure (figure 1) and discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Platelet function testing"", section on 'Thromboelastography (TEG) and ROTEM' and ""Acute coagulopathy associated with trauma"", section on 'Thromboelastography'.)Distinction from DIC — The hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 has been referred to by some as a DIC-like state, especially because many affected individuals are acutely ill and meet criteria for probable DIC in a scoring system published by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) in 2009 [15]. However, the major clinical finding in COVID-19 is thrombosis, whereas the major finding in acute decompensated DIC is bleeding.Likewise, COVID-19 has some similar laboratory findings to DIC, including a marked increase in D-dimer and in some cases mild thrombocytopenia. However, other coagulation parameters in COVID-19 are distinct from DIC. In COVID-19, the typical findings include high fibrinogen and high factor VIII activity, suggesting that major consumption of coagulation factors is not occurring [3]. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above.)In contrast, acute decompensated DIC is associated with low fibrinogen due to consumption of clotting factors. In one of the largest series that reported on thromboembolic events, none of the patients developed overt DIC [16].Typically, bleeding predominates in acute decompensated DIC and thrombosis predominates in chronic compensated DIC, although there is significant overlap. Thus, the hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 is more similar to compensated DIC than to acute DIC. However, in COVID-19 the platelet count and aPTT are typically normal. (See ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Pathogenesis'.)This ISTH scoring system is based on laboratory findings and is only intended for use in patients with an underlying condition known to be associated with DIC [15]. COVID-19 would qualify based on being a severe infection. Points are given for thrombocytopenia (1 point for platelet count 50,000 to 100,000/microL; 2 points for <50,000/microL), prolonged PT (1 point for 3 to 6 seconds of prolongation; 2 points for more than 6 seconds), low fibrinogen (1 point for <100 mg/dL), and increased D-dimer (2 points for moderate increase; 3 points for ""strong"" increase). A score of 5 or more points suggests DIC is probable. Despite this, the diagnosis of DIC is made clinically; there is no gold standard and no single test or combination of tests that is pathognomonic. Compared with expert opinion, the ISTH scoring system is reported to have a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 97 percent [15]. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above.)Regardless of whether the differences from DIC or the similarities are emphasized, many of the basic principles of DIC management apply, including the importance of treating the underlying condition, the importance of basing interventions on the clinical picture rather than on laboratory testing alone, and the need to provide anticoagulation for thrombosis and appropriate hemostatic therapies for bleeding. (See ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Treatment'.)CLINICAL FEATURESVTE — Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is very common in acutely ill patients with COVID-19, seen in up to one-third of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), even when prophylactic anticoagulation is used. Two autopsy studies emphasize the contributions of hypercoagulability and associated inflammation in patients who die from COVID-19:●Post-mortem examination of 21 individuals with COVID-19 found prominent PE in four, with microthrombi in alveolar capillaries in 5 of 11 (45 percent) who had available histology [17]. Three had evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy with fibrin thrombi in glomerular capillaries. The average age was 76 years, and most had a high body mass index (BMI; mean, 31 kg/m2; normal 18.5 to <25). Information on use of anticoagulation prior to death was available for 11, and all 11 were receiving some form of anticoagulation. Underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were common.●Post-mortem examination of 12 consecutive individuals with COVID-19 (8 male; 10 hospitalized) revealed DVT in 7 of 12 (58 percent) [18]. All cases of DVT had bilateral leg involvement, and none were suspected before death. Of the 12 for whom lung histology was available, 5 (42 percent) had evidence of thrombosis. PE was the cause of death in four. In those who had D-dimer testing, some had extremely high values (two >20,000 ng/mL and one >100,000 ng/mL; normal value <500 ng/mL [<500 mcg/L]). Use of anticoagulation prior to death was only reported in 4 of the 12. The mean BMI was 28.7 kg/m2; only three patients had a normal BMI, and they had cancer, ulcerative colitis, and/or chronic kidney disease. Both of these studies noted the preponderance of males with a high prevalence of obesity and other chronic medical comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. ICU — Case series of ICU patients have reported high rates of VTE (range, 20 to 43 percent), mostly pulmonary embolism (PE), and often despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation: ●A series of 184 sequential patients with severe COVID-19 in the ICU reported PE in 25 (14 percent), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 1, and catheter-associated thrombosis in 2 [16]. The cumulative incidence of VTE (based on different durations of follow-up) was calculated at 27 percent. All were receiving at least standard dose thromboprophylaxis. The group as a whole was very ill, with 13 percent requiring renal replacement therapy and 13 percent mortality. Three-fourths of the patients were male, and several had active cancer (independent VTE risk factors). ●A series of 150 ICU patients reported VTE in 64 (43 percent, mostly PE) and clotting of the extracorporeal circuit in 28 of 29 receiving continuous renal replacement therapy and 2 of 12 undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [7]. All patients were receiving thromboprophylaxis (mostly low molecular weight [LMW] heparin), 70 percent with prophylactic dose and 30 percent therapeutic dose. This study also compared the subgroup of 77 patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to a matched cohort of 145 patients with non-COVID-19-ARDS and found the rate of thrombotic complications (mostly PE) to be higher in the COVID-19 patients (12 versus 2 percent).●A series of 107 ICU patients reported PE in 22 (21 percent; cumulative incidence at 15 days, 20 percent) [19]. Of the 22 patients with PE, 20 were receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 2 were receiving therapeutic dose anticoagulation (for prior VTE and atrial fibrillation). By comparison, the incidence of PE in two matched cohorts (one from the same time interval in the previous year and one from concurrent patients with influenza rather than COVID-19) were 6 and 8 percent, respectively.●A series that included 74 ICU patients reported VTE in 29 (39 percent), with a cumulative incidence of 25 percent at 7 days and 48 percent at 14 days [20]. All of these individuals were receiving anticoagulation, most at prophylactic levels. None of the patients receiving therapeutic level anticoagulation at admission developed VTE.●An earlier series of 81 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia reported VTE in 20 (25 percent) [21].●A study that performed screening leg ultrasounds in 26 individuals with COVID-19 in the ICU who were all receiving either prophylactic dose or therapeutic dose anticoagulation found VTE in 18 (69 percent), including bilateral clots in 10 (38 percent) [22]. Some of these individuals had additional VTE risk factors including cancer, recent surgery, high body mass index (BMI), or prior VTE; 7 (27 percent) were receiving anticoagulation prior to admission.VTE risk is in the range where some experts would suggest more aggressive thromboprophylaxis dosing of anticoagulants or even empiric therapeutic dose anticoagulation for VTE prevention. Some of these studies noted a higher than average body mass index in affected individuals, suggesting that obesity, along with other risk factors, may warrant consideration in decision-making regarding the intensity of anticoagulation. (See 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below.)Inpatients (non-ICU) — Data are more limited regarding the rate of VTE in inpatients who are not in the ICU. The series with a 39 percent rate of VTE in ICU patients above also included 124 non-ICU patients, and of those, only 4 (3 percent) were diagnosed with VTE [20].A series from Ireland that included 50 patients on the regular medical ward reported similar findings to those in ICU patients, including high D-dimer and fibrinogen, and normal platelet counts and clotting times [23]. Outpatients — We are aware that thrombotic events have been observed in COVID-19 patients who were not admitted to the hospital, but data on the incidence are not available. Arterial events — There are also reports of arterial thrombosis, including in the central nervous system (CNS). As examples:●CNS – A single health system identified five cases of acute ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19 over a two-week period, with symptoms suggesting large-vessel occlusion; all patients were under 50 years of age [24]. In other time periods before the pandemic, there were approximately 0.7 large vessel strokes per two-week interval in individuals under age 50. In one of the series of ICU patients discussed above, ischemic stroke was observed in 3 of 184 (cumulative incidence, 3.7 percent) [16]. In another one of the series discussed above, cerebral ischemia was seen in 3 of 150 [7].●Limbs – A report described 20 patients with COVID-19 who developed acute limb ischemia at a single institution over a three-month period [25]. This represented a significant increase in limb ischemia over the previous year (16 percent, versus 2 percent in early 2019). Most were male (18 of 20), and the average age was 75 years. Surgical revascularization procedures were performed in 17, of which 12 (71 percent) were successful, a lower-than-expected success rate. Individuals who received postoperative heparin did not require reintervention, although the benefits of postoperative heparin did not reach statistical significance. Another report described four patients with acute limb ischemia due to thrombosis, two of whom were young and did not have any comorbidities (a 53-year-old man who developed aorto-iliac thrombosis and a 37-year-old man who developed humeral artery thrombosis) [26]. Both were receiving prophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin at the time thrombosis developed and both had very high D-dimer (>9000 ng/mL). Myocardial infarction has also been reported but not emphasized in available series.Microvascular thrombosis — Autopsy studies in some individuals who have died from COVID-19 have demonstrated microvascular thrombosis in the lungs [2,6]. The mechanism is unclear and may involve hypercoagulability, direct endothelial injury, complement activation, or other processes. In the absence of more definitive data regarding mechanisms or therapy, we would not pursue specialized testing for thrombotic microangiopathies (eg, ADAMTS13 activity, complement studies) or specialized therapies (eg, plasma exchange, anti-complement therapy) outside of a research study.Bleeding — Bleeding is less common than clotting in patients with COVID-19, but it may occur, especially in the setting of anticoagulation. As an example, in a subset of 25 ICU patients who were evaluated for abnormal neurologic findings, one had evidence of intracranial hemorrhage as well as ischemic lesions [7]. Three other patients in this series also had hemorrhagic complications, including two intracerebral bleeds associated with head trauma and one with hemorrhagic complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Three others in this series had evidence of intracerebral ischemia. (See 'Arterial events' above.)EVALUATION — The evaluation of patients with COVID-19 and coagulation abnormalities (suspected or documented) can be challenging due to the limited data on which clinical parameters or coagulation abnormalities should be acted upon and the concerns related to performing diagnostic imaging procedures on acutely ill and potentially contagious patients. A general approach is as follows, although other decisions may be made by the treating clinicians based on their evaluation of the patient. This approach is consistent with guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the American Society of Hematology (ASH), and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) [5,27,28]. Routine testing (all patients)●Inpatients – We assess the following in inpatients with COVID-19:•Complete blood count (CBC) including platelet count•Coagulation studies (prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT])•Fibrinogen•D-dimerRepeat testing is reasonable on a daily basis or less frequently, depending on the acuity of the patient's illness, the initial result, and the trend in values. Measurement of the D-dimer more than once per day is generally not indicated.As noted above, common laboratory findings include (see 'Coagulation abnormalities' above):•High D-dimer •High fibrinogen•Normal or mildly prolonged PT and aPTT•Mild thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, or normal platelet countWe do not intervene for these abnormal coagulation studies in the absence of clinical indications. However, these findings may have prognostic value and may impact decision-making about the level of care and/or investigational therapies directed at treating the infection. As an example, increasing D-dimer is associated with poor prognosis. (See 'Investigational therapies' below.)Atypical findings such as a markedly prolonged aPTT (out of proportion to the PT), low fibrinogen, or severe thrombocytopenia suggest that another condition may be present and additional evaluation may be indicated. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)We do not routinely test for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), other thrombotic microangiopathies, or antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). There are no therapeutic implications of transiently positive aPL in the absence of clinical findings. Transient aPL positivity is often seen in acute infections. (See ""Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome"", section on 'Other conditions associated with aPL'.)We do not routinely perform imaging for screening purposes, as there is no evidence that indicates this practice improves outcomes, and it may unnecessarily expose health care workers to additional infectious risks. However, imaging is appropriate in individuals with symptoms, as discussed below. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)●Outpatients – For outpatients, routine coagulation testing is not required. Evaluation of abnormal symptoms or findings on examination is similar to inpatients. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)Role of additional testingDiagnosis of DVT or PE — Evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) may be challenging, because symptoms of PE overlap with COVID-19, and imaging studies may not be feasible in all cases. The threshold for evaluation or diagnosis of DVT or PE should be low given the high frequency of these events and the presence of additional venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factors in many individuals. (See 'VTE' above.) ●DVT – Individuals with suspected DVT should have compression ultrasonography when feasible according to standard indications. (See ""Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity"".)●PE – We agree with guidance from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) regarding diagnosis of PE, which includes the following [29]:•A normal D-dimer is sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of PE. An increase in D-dimer is not specific for VTE and is not sufficient to make the diagnosis.•In patients with suspected PE due to unexplained hypotension, tachycardia, worsening respiratory status, or other risk factors for thrombosis, computed tomography with pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred test to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is an alternative if CTPA cannot be performed or is inconclusive, although V/Q scan may be unhelpful in individuals with significant pulmonary involvement from COVID-19. Consultation with the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) in decision-making is advised if possible. (See ""Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism"".)The role of full-dose anticoagulation if CTPA or V/Q scan is not feasible is discussed below. (See 'Documented or presumed VTE' below.)Infection control procedures should be followed in patients undergoing imaging studies. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Evaluation of atypical laboratory findings — As noted above, typical laboratory findings of COVID-19 are monitored for their prognostic value. (See 'Routine testing (all patients)' above.)Laboratory findings that are atypical for COVID-19, such as severe thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count <50,000/microL), a prolonged aPTT out of proportion to the PT, or a markedly reduced fibrinogen, should be evaluated as done for individuals without COVID-19, as discussed in separate topic reviews:●Thrombocytopenia – (See ""Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia"".)●Abnormal coagulation tests – (See ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Evaluation of abnormal results'.)Evaluation of bleeding — The evaluation is discussed separately. (See ""Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"" and ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Patient on anticoagulant'.)Management of bleeding depends on the underlying cause. (See 'Treatment of bleeding' below.)MANAGEMENTOverview of management considerations — Management can be challenging. Hypercoagulability appears to adversely impact prognosis, but there are no high-quality studies to support interventions that go beyond standard indications, and antithrombotic therapies carry risks of increased bleeding [30]. In the absence of high-quality data to guide management, institutions may vary in how aggressively they approach prevention and treatment of thromboembolic complications. Enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged to help determine the best approach [31]. Regardless of clinical trial enrollment, adherence to institutional protocols and input from individuals with expertise in hemostasis and thrombosis is advised to balance the risks of thrombosis and bleeding and guide decisions about antithrombotic therapy; bleeding caused by administration of excessive antithrombotic therapy may require prothrombotic treatments that further increase thrombotic risk.Acknowledging the lack of evidence, we agree with interim guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) [27,32]. Our approach is summarized in the table (table 1) and discussed in the following sections.Management of coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Additional options' and ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Inpatient VTE prophylaxis●Indications – Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is appropriate in all hospitalized medical, surgical, and obstetric patients with COVID-19 (algorithm 1), unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, active bleeding or serious bleeding in the prior 24 to 48 hours) or to the use of heparin (eg, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT], in which case an alternative agent such as fondaparinux may be used).•ICU – All patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) require thromboprophylaxis. As discussed below, some would empirically use intermediate dose or therapeutic dose anticoagulation in severely ill individuals in the absence of documented VTE. (See 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below.)•Medical (non-ICU) – All hospitalized medical patients should be treated with prophylactic-dose low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (or unfractionated heparin if LMW heparin is unavailable) for thromboprophylaxis. •Surgical – Perioperative VTE prophylaxis is especially important for patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized for a surgical procedure. Details of the timing and choice of agent are discussed separately. (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult orthopedic surgical patients"" and ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in adult nonorthopedic surgical patients"".)•Obstetric – We would also use VTE prophylaxis in obstetric patients with COVID-19 who are in the hospital prior to or following delivery. LMW heparin is appropriate if delivery is not expected within 24 hours and after delivery; unfractionated heparin is used if faster discontinuation is needed (eg, if delivery, neuraxial anesthesia, or an invasive procedure is anticipated within approximately 12 to 24 hours or at 36 to 37 weeks of gestation). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Hospitalized patients' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)●Dosing – Dosing (subcutaneous) is generally as follows; however, many experts are recommending higher doses for critically ill individuals, especially those in the ICU (see 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below):•Enoxaparin – For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30 mL/min, 40 mg once daily; for CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min, 30 mg once daily.•Dalteparin – 5000 units once daily.•Nadroparin – For patients ≤70 kg, 3800 or 4000 anti-factor Xa units once daily; for patients >70 kg, 5700 units once daily. In some cases, doses up to 50 anti-factor Xa units/kg every 12 hours are used. •Tinzaparin – 4500 anti-factor Xa units once daily.For patients with CrCl <15 mL/min or renal replacement therapy, we use unfractionated heparin, which is much less dependent on elimination by the kidney. The tables have more information about adjustments for kidney impairment (table 2), obesity (table 3), and pregnancy (table 4).●Supporting evidence – LMW heparin is known to reduce the risk of VTE and may have antiinflammatory properties. In a retrospective series of 2773 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, in whom 786 (28 percent) received systemic anticoagulation, anticoagulation was associated with improved in-hospital survival in intubated patients (71 percent, versus 37 percent for those who were not anticoagulated) [33]. Intubated patients represented approximately 14 percent of the cohort; in the cohort as a whole, anticoagulation was not associated with better in-hospital survival (78 versus 77 percent). Bleeding events occurred in 3 percent of the anticoagulated patients and 2 percent of those who were not anticoagulated (not a statistically significant difference).In a retrospective study of 449 individuals with severe COVID-19, enoxaparin (40 to 60 mg once daily) appeared to be associated with improved survival when compared to no pharmacologic prophylaxis, especially in those with a high D-dimer [12]. •The survival difference was only seen in a subset of individuals with a high sepsis-induced coagulopathy score (28-day mortality, 40 percent with heparin versus 64 percent without) or a high D-dimer, not in the cohort as a whole. •The magnitude of benefit was greater in those with higher D-dimer values. The reduced mortality became statistically significant at six times the upper limit of normal (33 versus 52 percent). One small series (16 patients) used higher prophylactic doses of nadroparin along with clopidogrel and did not report any VTE events; the small size of the study and lack of a control group limits interpretation [4]. As discussed above, a high percentage (25 to 43 percent) of individuals with COVID-19 in the ICU had VTE despite prophylactic dose anticoagulation, prompting many experts to suggest higher doses. (See 'VTE' above and 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation' below.)One study monitored antithrombin (AT) levels and provided AT concentrate for those with decreased levels [4]. However, we generally would not measure AT levels or consider AT concentrate unless an individual was known to have inherited AT deficiency or exhibited heparin resistance in association with a very low AT level. (See ""Antithrombin deficiency"", section on 'Heparin resistance'.)Indications for full-dose anticoagulation — Therapeutic dose (full-dose) anticoagulation (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours) is appropriate in the following settings, unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, active bleeding or serious bleeding in the prior 24 to 48 hours) or to the use of heparin (eg, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT], in which case an alternative agent such as fondaparinux may be used) (algorithm 1):Documented or presumed VTE — Therapeutic dose (full-dose) anticoagulation is appropriate for documented VTE, similar to individuals without COVID-19. (See 'Diagnosis of DVT or PE' above.)Full-dose anticoagulation is also reasonable in some cases of suspected VTE in which standard confirmatory testing is not available or feasible, including the following: ●In patients for whom computed tomography with pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is not feasible, the following may be sufficient to initiate treatment:•Confirmation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using bilateral compression ultrasonography of the legs.•Transthoracic echocardiography or point-of-care ultrasound that demonstrates clot in transit in the main pulmonary artery.●In patients for whom no confirmatory testing is possible, it may be reasonable to treat empirically with full-dose anticoagulation based on one or more of the following:•Sudden deterioration in respiratory status in an intubated patient consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE), especially when chest radiography and/or inflammatory markers are stable or improving and the change cannot be attributed to a cardiac cause. •Otherwise unexplained respiratory failure (eg, not due to fluid overload or acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), especially if the fibrinogen and/or D-dimer is very high. •Physical findings consistent with thrombosis (superficial thrombophlebitis or retiform purpura not explained by other conditions).For patients with acute VTE who are discharged from the hospital, extended thromboprophylaxis may be reasonable. (See 'Patients discharged from the hospital' below.) Clotting of intravascular access devices — Full-dose anticoagulation is appropriate for individuals with recurrent clotting of intravascular access devices (arterial lines, central venous catheters) despite prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation.Full-dose anticoagulation is also appropriate in those with clotting in extracorporeal circuits (continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). Details are discussed separately. (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients — The question of treatment-dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis has also been raised in critically ill individuals and those in the ICU who have not had confirmed or suspected acute VTE but are at high risk, as described above. (See 'VTE' above.)Many centers are recommending intermediate dose or even therapeutic intensity anticoagulation in these individuals (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Venous thromboembolism prevention'). There are no data comparing different levels of anticoagulation in these patients (prophylactic, intermediate, or therapeutic dosing), and clinical trials are in progress. Enrollment in such a trial is encouraged. As stated by the American Society of Hematology (ASH), empiric full-dose anticoagulation for individuals who do not have VTE remains controversial, since data demonstrating improved outcomes are lacking, and some of the risk factors for VTE are also risk factors for increased risk of bleeding [29]. Thus, if VTE is suspected, confirmatory testing should be obtained or other indications for full-dose anticoagulation should be sought if possible, especially in individuals who are not in the ICU. This testing and other findings that support therapeutic dose anticoagulation are discussed above. (See 'Diagnosis of DVT or PE' above.)Indications for tPA — Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is appropriate for usual indications, unless there is a contraindication:●Limb-threatening DVT – (See ""Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy in deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity: Patient selection and administration"".)●Massive PE – (See ""Approach to thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) therapy in acute pulmonary embolism: Patient selection and administration"".)●Acute stroke – (See ""Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke"".)  ●Acute myocardial infarction – (See ""Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: The use of fibrinolytic therapy"".) Consultation with the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) or stroke team in decision-making is advised if possible. In contrast, we are not using tPA in individuals with nonspecific findings such as hypoxia or laboratory evidence of hypercoagulability. A case series described administration of tPA to three individuals with ARDS associated with COVID-19 who did not have access to or were not eligible for other interventions such as ECMO [34]. One individual had transient improvement in laboratory parameters but ultimately died. The other two had improvement in laboratory parameters; clinical outcomes were not described.Outpatient thromboprophylaxisPatients discharged from the hospital — Individuals with documented VTE require a minimum of three months of anticoagulation, as discussed separately. (See ""Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"", section on 'Duration of therapy' and ""Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults"".)Some individuals who have not had a VTE may also warrant extended thromboprophylaxis following discharge from the hospital:●We would be most likely to use post-discharge prophylactic anticoagulation in individuals with other risk factors for VTE such as immobilization, recent surgery, or trauma. ●We would use other criteria similar to those used in the APEX and MARINER trials, including immobility and older age. Most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 would meet these criteria. ●However, bleeding risk also needs to be incorporated into decision-making. ●Options for post-discharge prophylaxis include those used in clinical trials, such as rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 31 to 39 days [35]. This subject is discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults"", section on 'Duration of prophylaxis'.) Patients not admitted to the hospital — Outpatient thromboprophylaxis may also be appropriate for selected individuals with COVID-19 who are not admitted to the hospital, especially those with other thrombotic risk factors such as prior VTE or recent surgery, trauma, or immobilization, noting that this practice is based on clinical judgment. There are no trials that address thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19.If thromboprophylaxis is used in an outpatient, we would use a regimen such as rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 31 to 39 days [35]. Treatment of bleeding — Bleeding does not appear to be a major manifestation of COVID-19. However, patients may have bleeding for other reasons, including trauma and/or treatment with anticoagulation. (See 'Bleeding' above.)The approach to bleeding is similar to individuals without COVID-19 and may involve anticoagulant reversal and/or discontinuation, transfusions for thrombocytopenia or hypofibrinogenemia, or specific therapies such as factor replacement.●Anticoagulant-associated bleeding – (See ""Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR"" and ""Management of bleeding in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants"" and ""Reversal of anticoagulation in intracranial hemorrhage"".)●Trauma coagulopathy – (See ""Acute coagulopathy associated with trauma"".)●An underlying bleeding disorder such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), hemophilia, or von Willebrand disease (VWD) – (See ""Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Initial treatment and prognosis"" and ""Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B"" and ""von Willebrand disease (VWD): Treatment of major bleeding and major surgery"".)Antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, epsilon aminocaproic acid) are generally not used in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), due to the concern that they may tip the balance towards thrombosis. Thus, they should be avoided in patients in whom the COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state is the predominant finding. (See 'Distinction from DIC' above and ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Prevention/treatment of bleeding'.)Fibrinogen is often increased in COVID-19, and supplementation with fibrinogen is not required unless there is bleeding that is attributable to hypofibrinogenemia or dysfibrinogenemia (fibrinogen activity level <150 to 200 mg/dL). (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above and ""Disorders of fibrinogen"", section on 'Treatment/prevention of bleeding'.)Investigational therapies — A number of therapies for COVID-19 are under investigation, some of which may impact thrombotic risk. However, effects of these treatments on hemostasis in this patient population have not been well studied. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Participation in clinical trials is encouraged in order to improve understanding of the most effective and safest means of preventing and treating thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Investigational therapies may be appropriate in life-threatening situations or as part of a clinical trial, and markedly increased D-dimer may be used as one criterion for identifying individuals with a worse prognosis. Close monitoring for clinical signs of thrombosis or bleeding is advised in all individuals with COVID-19, with input from an individual with expertise in hemostasis and thrombosis in those with severe or unusual presentations.SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"") ●Society guidelines for patients (see ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a hypercoagulable state associated with acute inflammatory changes and laboratory findings that are distinct from acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), save for those with very severe disease. Fibrinogen and D-dimer are increased, with typically only modest prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and mild thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia. The presence of a lupus anticoagulant is common in individuals with a prolonged aPTT. The pathogenesis of these abnormalities is incompletely understood, and there may be many contributing factors related to the acute inflammatory response to the disease. (See 'Pathogenesis' above.)●The risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is markedly increased, especially in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), with case series reporting prevalences of 25 to 43 percent in ICU patients, often despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. The risk for other thrombotic events (stroke, microvascular thrombosis) is less clear. (See 'Clinical features' above.)●All patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 should have a baseline complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer. Repeat testing is done according to the patient's clinical status. Outpatients do not require coagulation testing. The main purpose of this testing is to obtain prognostic information that may be used to inform level of care. (See 'Routine testing (all patients)' above.)●Imaging studies are appropriate for suspected VTE if feasible. If standard diagnostic studies are not feasible, other options for determining the need for therapeutic dose anticoagulation are available, as discussed above. Laboratory abnormalities that are not typical of COVID-19 should be further evaluated, as described above. (See 'Role of additional testing' above.)●Management is challenging due to the acuity of the illness and a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding efficacy and safety of different approaches to prevent or treat thromboembolic complications of the disease. Our general approach, which is summarized in the table (table 1) and depicted in the algorithm (algorithm 1), includes:•All inpatients should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin is preferred but unfractionated heparin can be used if LMW heparin is unavailable or if kidney function is severely impaired. Some institutional protocols include more aggressive anticoagulation with intermediate dose or even therapeutic dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis. (See 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' above and 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' above.)•Therapeutic dose (full-dose) anticoagulation is appropriate to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), unless contraindicated. (See 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation' above.)•Bleeding is unusual but can occur. If it occurs, treatment is similar to non-COVID-19 patients and may include transfusions, anticoagulant reversal or discontinuation, or specific products for underlying bleeding disorders. (See 'Treatment of bleeding' above.)•Participation in clinical trials is encouraged in order to improve understanding of the most effective and safest means of preventing and treating thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Disease-specific therapies under investigation may impact thrombotic risk, but the effects of these treatments on hemostasis in this patient population have not been well-documented.

In pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia, these early data show approximately the same rate of intensive care unit admissions as their nonpregnant counterparts. A single maternal death has been reported in the medical literature. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Maternal course'.)Does COVID-19 increase the risk for pregnancy complications?Yes, infected women, especially those who develop pneumonia, appear to have an increased frequency of preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of gestation) and cesarean delivery, which is likely related to severe maternal illness. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Pregnancy complications'.)Does SARS-CoV-2 cross the placenta?There is no definite evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crosses the placenta and infects the fetus; however, one case of placental infection and a few cases of possible in utero infection have been reported. These neonatal cases may have been false-positive test results or due to acquisition of infection soon after birth. Reports of COVID-19 infection in the neonate have generally described mild disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Vertical transmission'.)How can prenatal care be modified to decrease risk of contracting COVID-19?The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine support modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits to limit person-to-person contact and thus help prevent spread of COVID-19. Modifications should be tailored for low- versus high-risk pregnancies (eg, multiple gestation, hypertension, diabetes) and may include telehealth, reducing the number of in-person visits, timing of visits, grouping tests (eg, aneuploidy, diabetes, infection screening) to minimize maternal contact with others, restricting visitors during visits and tests, timing of indicated obstetric ultrasound examinations, and timing and frequency of use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Routine prenatal care in uninfected women'.)Should low-dose aspirin be avoided in pregnant women with COVID-19?Concern about possible negative effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for whom low-dose aspirin is indicated (eg, prevention of preeclampsia), ACOG suggests an individualized approach to continuation versus discontinuation. For example, continuing preeclampsia prophylaxis is likely not worthwhile in severely or critically ill patients or near term. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications'.)Should antenatal glucocorticoids be avoided in pregnant women with COVID-19?For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because they have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. However, the CDC have not addressed use of antenatal glucocorticoids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from preterm birth.Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. However, for pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation and at risk of preterm birth within seven days, the benefits to the neonate are less clear, and ACOG has advised not administering a course of betamethasone to such patients. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications'.)LABOR AND DELIVERYIs maternal COVID-19 an indication for cesarean delivery?No, COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery. Even if vertical transmission is confirmed as additional data are reported, this would not be an indication for cesarean delivery since it would increase maternal risk and would be unlikely to improve newborn outcome. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Route of delivery'.)Should planned induction of labor or cesarean delivery of asymptomatic women be postponed during the pandemic?No, in asymptomatic women, inductions of labor and cesarean deliveries with appropriate medical indications should not be postponed or rescheduled. This includes 39-week inductions or cesarean deliveries after patient counseling. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Timing delivery in infected women'.)How should labor pain be managed in women with COVID-19?A neuraxial anesthetic is generally preferred to other options for management of labor pain because it provides good analgesia and thus reduces cardiopulmonary stress from pain and anxiety. In addition, it is available in case an emergency cesarean is required, thus obviating the need for general anesthesia. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) suggests considering suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 because of insufficient data about cleaning, filtering, and potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems. They also urge consideration of limiting use of intravenous patient controlled analgesia because of the risk of respiratory depression. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Analgesia and anesthesia'.)Can an asymptomatic partner/support person attend labor and delivery?Practices vary by institution. At a minimum, the support person should be screened in accordance with hospital policies, and those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. Most facilities recognize that a support person is important to many laboring women and permit one support person who must remain with the laboring woman (may not leave her room and then return). Additional support persons can be a part of the patient's labor and delivery via video. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Infection control precautions'.)POSTPARTUMHow should the baby be evaluated?If the mother has known COVID-19, the infant is a COVID-19 suspect and should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Infant evaluation'.)Should the mother with COVID-19 be separated from her baby?The CDC advise health care facilities to determine whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the mother's clinical condition. Separation is unnecessary if the infant's SARS-CoV-2 testing result is positive. If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, measures to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission should be utilized (eg, physical barriers, mother-baby ≥6 feet separation, maternal use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, use of a healthy adult for infant care). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Mother-baby contact'.)How long should mother-baby precautions at home continue after recent infection?After discharge from the birth facility, a mother with symptomatic COVID-19 infection should maintain a distance of at least six feet from the newborn and use a face mask and hand hygiene for newborn care until (1) at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications plus improvement in respiratory symptoms [cough, shortness of breath]) and (2) at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. For mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have never been symptomatic, transmission precautions can be discontinued when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test. Test-based strategies for discontinuation of precautions are also available. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'After hospital discharge'.)Can breast milk transmit SARS-CoV-2?It is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk because very few breast milk samples have been tested. One report of testing found no virus in the breast milk of six patients and another found virus in one of the three samples of breast milk tested. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)What precautions should mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 take when breastfeeding?Droplet transmission from an infected mother to her baby could occur through close contact during breastfeeding. To minimize direct contact, ideally, the infant should be fed expressed breastmilk by a healthy caregiver following hygiene precautions until the mother has recovered or proven uninfected. In such cases, the mother should use strict handwashing before pumping and wear a face mask during pumping. If this approach is not possible, mothers should take precautions to prevent transmission to the infant during breastfeeding (including hand and breast hygiene and use of a face mask). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)Can postpartum women with COVID-19 take NSAIDs for postpartum analgesia?Concern about possible negative effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs when clinically indicated. Given the uncertainty, we suggest using acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used.

With droplet transmission, virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes. Infection can also occur if a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) and do not linger in the air. In one report, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols under experimental conditions for at least three hours; however, whether this is clinically meaningful is uncertain.While SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in non-respiratory specimens (eg, stool, blood), neither fecal-oral nor bloodborne transmission appear to be significant sources of infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described in animals, but there is no evidence to suggest that animals are a major source of transmission. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)What is the incubation period for COVID-19?The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Incubation period'.)CLINICAL PRESENTATIONWhat are the clinical presentation and natural history of COVID-19?The spectrum of illness associated with COVID-19 is wide, ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening respiratory failure. When symptoms are present, they typically arise approximately four to five days after exposure. Symptoms are mild in approximately 80 percent of cases and often include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Smell and taste disorders have also been reported in patients with COVID-19; whether these symptoms are distinguishing features is unknown. Gastrointestinal symptoms are not frequently reported but may be the presenting feature in some patients. Headache, rhinorrhea, and sore throat are less common. Dyspnea affects approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients, typically arising five to eight days after symptom onset. Progression from dyspnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be rapid; thus, the onset of dyspnea is generally an indication for hospital evaluation and management.Pneumonia is the most common manifestation of severe disease. ARDS develops in a sizable minority of symptomatic patients and can be associated with a cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fever, progressive hypoxia and/or hypotension, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. ARDS is the leading cause of death, followed by sepsis, cardiac complications, and secondary infections. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to be between two and three percent. While severe and fatal illness can occur in anyone, the risk rises dramatically with age and the presence of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and cancer. For those who recover, illness is often prolonged, lasting approximately two weeks in those with mild disease and three to six weeks in those with severe disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Is there a way to distinguish COVID-19 clinically from other respiratory illnesses, particularly influenza?No, the clinical features of COVID-19 overlap substantially with influenza and other respiratory viral illnesses. There is no way to distinguish among them without testing. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)What factors are associated with severe COVID-19?Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but it predominantly occurs in adults with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities. Comorbidities associated with severe illness and mortality include:●Cardiovascular disease●Diabetes mellitus●Hypertension●Chronic lung disease●Cancer●Chronic kidney disease●Obesity (body mass index ≥30)Immunosuppression is also presumed to be a risk factor for severe illness and mortality, but this has not yet been definitively demonstrated in studies. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)What are the major thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19?COVID-19 is a hypercoagulable state associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), often pulmonary embolism (PE). The risk is highest in individuals in the intensive care unit (ICU), often despite prophylactic anticoagulation. The rate of arterial events is unclear, and the rate of VTE is lower in hospitalized medical patients. Bleeding is not common but has been seen, especially in the setting of trauma and/or anticoagulation. Thrombotic complications are treated with therapeutic dose anticoagulation. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'VTE'.)What are the major coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19?A number of laboratory abnormalities have been reported, including high fibrinogen and D-dimer and mild prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Abnormal coagulation studies are mainly used to monitor clinical status and to help determine level of care. Very high D-dimer is associated with a high mortality rate. Atypical findings (eg, severe thrombocytopenia) should be further evaluated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Coagulation abnormalities'.)EVALUATIONWhen should patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 be advised to stay at home? Go to the hospital?Home management is appropriate for most patients with mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea), provided they can be adequately isolated, monitored, and supported in the outpatient setting. However, there should be a low threshold to clinically evaluate patients who have any risk factor for more severe illness, even if they have only mild symptoms. Patients being managed at home should be educated about the potential for worsening disease and advised to closely monitor for symptoms of more serious disease, including dyspnea or persistent chest pain. The development of these symptoms should prompt clinical evaluation and possible hospitalization. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted'.)What are the different types of tests for COVID-19?There are two major types of tests for COVID-19: ●Nucleic acid amplifications tests (NAATs; eg, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) – RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 is the primary test used to diagnose active COVID-19. The test is typically performed on nasopharyngeal swabs, but can also be performed on other respiratory tract specimens (eg, oropharyngeal swabs, lower respiratory tract samples). There are several different RT-PCR assays available, and the sensitivity and specificity of each assay differ. ●Serology – Serologic tests measure antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are primarily used to identify patients who have had COVID-19 in the past. While some serologic assays can help identify patients with acute infection, they are not as reliable as RT-PCR and not recommended for this purpose. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)How accurate is RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2? Should two tests be performed or one?Tests for COVID-19 are new, and determining their accuracy is challenging. A positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, false-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been well documented. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, we suggest repeating the test. For hospitalized patients with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement, the repeat test can be performed on expectorated sputum or a tracheal aspirate, if available. In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing and concern for false-negative results, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk (residence in or travel to an area with widespread community transmission or known contact). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)HOME CAREWhat advice should be given to patients with known or presumed COVID-19 managed at home?For most patients with COVID-19 who are managed at home, we advise the following: ●Supportive care with antipyretics/analgesics (eg, acetaminophen) and hydration ●Close contact with their health care provider ●Monitoring for clinical worsening, particularly the development of dyspnea, which should prompt clinical evaluation and possible hospitalization●Separation from other household members, including pets (eg, staying in a separate room when possible and wearing a mask when in the same room)●Frequent hand washing for all family members●Frequent disinfection of commonly touched surfaces(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients'.)How long should patients cared for at home stay isolated?The optimal duration of home isolation is uncertain. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued recommendations on discontinuation of home isolation, which include both test-based and non-test-based strategies. The choice of strategy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, since each strategy has potential limitations. When a test-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue home isolation when there is:●Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications AND●Improvement in respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) AND●Negative results of a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) When a symptom-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue home isolation when the following criteria are met:●At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared AND●At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery of symptoms (defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms [eg, cough, shortness of breath])In some cases, patients may have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, but they did not have any symptoms when they were tested. In such patients, home isolation may be discontinued using a test-based strategy or a time-based strategy (when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 test) as long as there was no evidence of subsequent illness. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)MEDICATIONSWhat are the treatment options for patients with COVID-19? Do any have proven efficacy?All agents being used for the treatment of COVID-19 are investigational. Use of these agents is generally limited to hospitalized patients who have or are at risk for severe disease. When possible, treatment should be given as part of a clinical trial. Agents that appear more promising are listed here:●Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This intravenous agent is not routinely available, but the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized emergency use, and several centers in the United States and elsewhere are performing randomized trials to evaluate its efficacy. Data from these trials are emerging and remain limited; there appears to be a clinical benefit to remdesivir, but the patient population most likely to benefit is uncertain.●Hydroxychloroquine is an older, oral agent that has direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Multiple trials evaluating its efficacy for COVID-19 treatment are underway; the FDA has granted emergency use authorization for adolescents and adults hospitalized with COVID-19 when a clinical trial is not feasible. ●Interleukin (IL)-6 pathway inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, are used at some centers for patients with severe disease and/or evidence of cytokine release syndrome. Like the other agents listed here, evidence of efficacy is anecdotal, and additional study is underway. ●Convalescent plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 contains antibodies that could potentially hasten recovery in patients with active COVID-19. In the United States, the FDA is accepting emergency investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19.Other investigational agents include favipiravir, interferon beta, lopinavir-ritonavir, and combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin. Because all treatment options are investigational, monitoring for adverse effects is an important part of care. Registries of clinical trials can be found on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Should I use acetaminophen or NSAIDs when providing supportive care?Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been theorized to cause harm in patients with COVID-19, but there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk. Given the uncertainty, we use acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent for most patients rather than NSAIDs. If NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose. We do not routinely discontinue NSAIDs in patients using them for the management of chronic illnesses. The FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) do not recommend that NSAIDs be avoided when clinically indicated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Should glucocorticoids be used for treatment of COVID-19?No, we agree with recommendations by the WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that systemic glucocorticoids not be used in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications (eg, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)Do ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the likelihood of severe COVID-19?Patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents. The membrane-bound ACE2 functions as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and because ACE inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2, there is speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for severe disease. However, there is no evidence to support an association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with more severe disease, and it is also possible that these drugs may attenuate the severity of disease. In addition, stopping these agents in some patients can exacerbate comorbid cardiovascular or kidney disease and increase mortality. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'ACE inhibitors/ARBs' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)When should anticoagulation be used, and how much?All inpatients with COVID-19 (intensive care unit [ICU], medical, surgical, and obstetric) should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated (algorithm 1). Prophylactic dose low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is preferred, but prophylactic dose unfractionated heparin can be used if LMW heparin is unavailable or if kidney function is severely impaired. Some institutional protocols include more aggressive anticoagulation with intermediate dose or even therapeutic dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis, especially in the ICU, and some continue anticoagulation in selected patients following discharge. Data are lacking on the efficacy and safety of these approaches, and enrollment in a clinical trial is encouraged. Full (therapeutic)-dose anticoagulation is used for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Management'.)PREVENTION AND INFECTION CONTROLHave any medications been shown to prevent COVID-19?No agent is known to be effective for preventing COVID-19. While hydroxychloroquine is being studied as a prophylactic agent, its safety and efficacy have not been proven. We suggest that neither this medication nor any other be used for prophylaxis outside of clinical trials. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)What PPE is recommended for health care workers taking care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?Any personnel entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE): gown, gloves, eye protection (eyeglasses alone are insufficient), and a respirator (eg, an N95 respirator). If the supply of respirators is limited, facemasks are an acceptable alternative, except during aerosol-generating procedures (eg, tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, bronchoscopy, noninvasive ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Health care workers should be aware of the appropriate sequence of putting on (figure 1) and taking off (figure 2) PPE to avoid contamination.In addition, patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures should be placed in negative-pressure rooms. Most other patients can be placed in a single-occupancy, neutral-pressure room with the door closed. Patients with suspected or known COVID-19 should not be placed in positive-pressure rooms. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)IMMUNITYDoes protective immunity develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection? Can reinfection occur?Antibodies to the virus are induced in those who have become infected. Preliminary evidence suggests that some of these antibodies are protective, but this remains to be definitively established. Moreover, it is unknown whether all infected patients mount a protective immune response and how long any protective effect will last. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Immunity and risk of reinfection'.)SPECIAL POPULATIONSAsthma/COPDShould patients using inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma or COPD be advised to stop these medications to prevent COVID-19?No, patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who need inhaled glucocorticoids to maintain control of their asthma or COPD should continue them at their usual dose. When indicated, inhaled steroids help to minimize risk of an asthma or COPD exacerbation and the associated need for interaction with the health care system. There is no good evidence that inhaled glucocorticoids increase susceptibility to COVID-19 or have an adverse effect on the course of infection. Stopping them may worsen asthma or COPD control and thereby increase the risk for complications of COVID-19, if acquired. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Should patients with COVID-19 and an acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD be treated with systemic glucocorticoids?Yes, patients with COVID-19 infection and a concomitant acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD should receive prompt treatment with systemic glucocorticoids as indicated by usual guidelines. Delaying therapy can increase the risk of a life-threatening exacerbation. While the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend glucocorticoids not be routinely used in the treatment of COVID-19 infection, exacerbations of asthma and COPD are considered appropriate indications for use. Overall, the known benefits of systemic glucocorticoids for exacerbations of asthma and COPD outweigh the potential harm in COVID-19 infection. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeedingWhat special considerations are there for pregnant and breastfeeding women?Issues related to COVID-19 during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: Questions and answers"".)BLOOD DONATIONWhat should I tell patients about donating blood or plasma during the pandemic?Blood donation is particularly important during the pandemic due to concerns that the supply could become critically low. Having a history of COVID-19 is not an exclusion to donation as long as the illness resolved at least 14 days prior to donation. Persons who have recovered from COVID-19 are encouraged to donate plasma, because convalescent plasma is an investigational treatment for COVID-19. Information on where to donate blood or plasma can be found at the American Red Cross and the AABB websites or by contacting community blood centers. (See ""Blood donor screening: Medical history"", section on 'COVID-19 pandemic revised deferral criteria' and ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)REFERENCESSupporting references can be found in the linked UpToDate topics.",2020-05-11 02:00:00,UPTODATE,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
ID:127429,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.This topic will discuss the management of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. Our approach to hospital management is based on limited data and evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management, which may differ from our approach. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and, in the United States, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3] and the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel [4]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)The management of patients with COVID-19 in the home and outpatient setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Issues related to COVID-19 in specific populations are discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EVALUATION — Our objective in the evaluation of hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 is to evaluate for features associated with severe illness (table 1) and identify organ dysfunction or other comorbidities that could complicate potential therapy. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Although we check several laboratory tests to evaluate patients with documented or suspected COVID-19, the prognostic value of many of them remains uncertain, and other institutions may not include all these tests. At least initially, we check the following laboratory studies daily:●Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, with a focus on the total lymphocyte count trend●Complete metabolic panel●Creatine kinase (CK)●C-reactive protein (CRP)●FerritinInitially, we check the following studies every other day (or daily if elevated or in the intensive care unit):●Prothrombin time (PT)/partial prothrombin time (PTT)/fibrinogen●D-dimerWe check the following studies at baseline and repeat them if abnormal or with clinical worsening:●Lactate dehydrogenase, repeated daily if elevated●Troponin, repeated every two to three days if elevated●Electrocardiogram (ECG), with at least one repeat test after starting any QTc-prolonging agent (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Monitoring for QT prolongation')We also check hepatitis B virus serologies, hepatitis C virus antibody, and HIV antigen/antibody testing if these have not been previously performed. Chronic viral hepatitis could affect interpretation of transaminase elevations and exacerbate hepatotoxicity of certain therapies; underlying HIV infection may change the assessment of the patient's risk for deterioration and would warrant initiation of antiretroviral therapy. We check a portable chest radiograph in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; for most patients, this is sufficient for initial evaluation of pulmonary complications and extent of lung involvement. Although chest computed tomography (CT) was frequently used in China for evaluation of patients with COVID-19, we reserve chest CT for circumstances that might change clinical management, in part to minimize infection control issues related to transport. This is consistent with recommendations from the American College of Radiology [5]. Although certain characteristic chest CT findings may be seen in COVID-19, they cannot reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other causes of viral pneumonia. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.)We do not routinely obtain echocardiograms on patients with COVID-19; developments that might warrant an echocardiogram include increasing troponin levels with hemodynamic compromise or other cardiovascular findings suggestive of cardiomyopathy. Acute myocardial injury has been a described complication of COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'When to suspect myocardial injury and key considerations'.) Secondary bacterial infection has not been a frequently reported feature of COVID-19; if this is suspected (eg, based on chest imaging or sudden deterioration), we check two sets of blood cultures and sputum Gram stain and culture. Procalcitonin can be checked to assess the risk of secondary bacterial infection; however, since elevated procalcitonin levels have been reported as COVID-19 progresses, they may be less specific for bacterial infection later in the disease course [6-9]. As above, the prognostic value of the results of some of the tests we use to evaluate patients with COVID-19 is uncertain, and the optimal use of these markers remains unknown. As an example, although some clinicians also note the potential utility of troponin levels to inform the risk of severe COVID-19 and provide a baseline for comparison in patients who develop manifestations of myocardial injury [10], others reserve troponin level testing for patients who have specific clinical suspicion for acute coronary syndrome [11]. One concern is that the results could lead to unnecessary use of medical resources (eg, serial troponins, electrocardiograms and cardiology consults for elevated troponin). If troponin is checked in a patient with COVID-19, clinicians should be aware that an elevated level does not necessarily indicate acute coronary syndrome. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'Troponin'.) GENERAL MANAGEMENT ISSUESEmpiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia in select patients — For patients with documented COVID-19, we do not routinely administer empiric therapy for bacterial pneumonia. Data are limited, but bacterial superinfection does not appear to be a prominent feature of COVID-19. However, since the clinical features of COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from bacterial pneumonia, empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia is reasonable when the diagnosis is uncertain. Empiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia may also be reasonable in patients with documented COVID-19 if there is clinical suspicion for it (eg, new fever after defervescence with new consolidation on chest imaging). If empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated, we attempt to make a microbial diagnosis (eg, through sputum Gram stain and culture, urinary antigen testing) and reevaluate the need to continue antibiotic therapy daily. In such settings, a low procalcitonin may be helpful to suggest against a bacterial pneumonia; however, elevated procalcitonin has been described in COVID-19, particularly late in the course of illness, and does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection [6-9]. (See ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"", section on 'Guiding antibiotic therapy'.)The diagnosis of and empiric antibiotic regimens for community-acquired and health care-associated pneumonia are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Overview of community-acquired pneumonia in adults"" and ""Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"" and ""Treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"".)Prevention of and evaluation for venous thromboembolism — We favor pharmacologic prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19, consistent with recommendations from several expert societies [12-14]. Dosing and selection of pharmacologic agents to prevent venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis'.)Several studies suggest a high rate of thromboembolic complications among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly those who are critically ill. The thromboembolic risk with COVID-19 as well as the evaluation for and management of these complications are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'VTE' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation'.)Uncertainty about NSAID use — There are minimal data informing the risks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the setting of COVID-19. We use acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose; this is consistent with the general approach to fever reduction in adults (see ""Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults"", section on 'Treating fever'). We do not discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions, unless there are other reasons to stop them (eg, renal injury, gastrointestinal bleeding). Concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young patients who received NSAIDs early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [15,16]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO, and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel do not recommend NSAIDs be avoided when clinically indicated [4,17,18]. Avoiding nebulized medications — Inhaled medications should be administered by metered dose inhaler, whenever possible, rather than through a nebulizer, to avoid the risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 through nebulization. If a nebulizer must be used, appropriate infection control precautions should be taken. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)'.)Limited role of glucocorticoids — We agree with recommendations by the WHO and CDC that systemic glucocorticoids not be used in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications (eg, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) [19,20].For those without pre-existing pulmonary disease, we also avoid inhaled glucocorticoids. The use of inhaled glucocorticoids in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the setting of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Acute exacerbations of asthma in adults: Emergency department and inpatient management"", section on 'Advice related to covid-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in management of SARS, there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm [21]. (See ""Treatment of seasonal influenza in adults"", section on 'Adjunctive therapies' and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Treatment and prevention"", section on 'Treatment'.)The approach to glucocorticoids among critically ill patients with COVID-19 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'.)Managing chronic medicationsACE inhibitors/ARBs — Patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents if there is no other reason for discontinuation (eg, hypotension, acute kidney injury). This approach is supported by multiple guidelines panels [22-26]. There has been speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes, but this has not been supported by findings from observational studies. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)Conversely, ARBs have also been proposed to have potential protective effects based on their mechanism of action [27], but there is no trial evidence to support this hypothesis. We do not use ACE inhibitors or ARBs as potential COVID-19 treatment.Statins — We make a point of continuing statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are already taking them. A high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 have underlying cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and other indications for use of statins. Moreover, acute cardiac injury is a reported complication of COVID-19. Although clinicians may be concerned about hepatotoxicity from statins, particularly since transaminase elevations are common in COVID-19, most evidence indicates that liver injury from statins is uncommon. (See ""Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration"", section on 'Hepatic dysfunction'.) Whether statins could impact the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clear. Statins are known inhibitors of the MYD88 pathway, which results in marked inflammation, and have been reported to stabilize MYD88 levels in the setting of external stress in vitro and in animal studies [28]. Dysregulation of MYD88 has been noted and associated with poor outcomes in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, but this has not been described with SARS-CoV-2. Although statins might be of benefit in patients with COVID-19, more data are needed.Immunomodulatory agents — Use of immunosuppressing agents has been associated with increased risk for severe disease with other respiratory viruses, and the decision to discontinue prednisone, biologics, or other immunosuppressive drugs in the setting of COVID-19 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"", section on 'Patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure'.) For individuals with underlying conditions who require treatment with these agents and do not have suspected or documented COVID-19, there is no evidence that routinely discontinuing treatment is of any benefit. In addition, discontinuing these medications may result in loss of response when the agent is reintroduced. The approach of continuing immunomodulatory therapy in patients without infection is supported by statements from dermatology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology societies [29-32].Infection control — Infection control is an essential component of management of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.) COVID-19-SPECIFIC THERAPYSpecific treatments — Several treatments are being evaluated for COVID-19. Although some of these treatments are clinically available for other indications, their use for COVID-19 remains investigational.Remdesivir — Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro [33]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for hospitalized children and adults with severe COVID-19 (SpO2 ≤94 percent on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) [34]. The suggested adult dose is 200 mg intravenously on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for 10 days total in patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO and 5 days total in other patients (with extension to 10 days if there is no clinical improvement). Remdesivir is not recommended in patients with an alanine aminotransferase ≥5 times the upper limit of normal (and should be discontinued if it rises above this level during treatment or if there are other signs of liver injury). The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in the setting of renal impairment are uncertain, and it is prepared in a cyclodextrin vehicle that accumulates in renal impairment and may be toxic; thus, remdesivir is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Data from comparative, randomized trials are needed to define the effect of remdesivir in COVID-19; these data are emerging but remain limited and mixed. Overall, if preliminary results are confirmed, there is likely some clinical benefit to remdesivir, although the patient population most likely to benefit remains uncertain.The United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced preliminary results of a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir among 1063 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and evidence of lung involvement [35]. On interim analysis, remdesivir resulted in a faster time to recovery, defined as being discharged from the hospital or no longer requiring supplemental oxygen (median 11 versus 15 days with placebo, p<0.001). There was also a trend towards lower mortality that was not statistically significant (8 versus 11.6 percent with placebo, p = 0.059). Final analysis and peer review of these data are pending. In contrast, in a double-blind randomized trial in China of 237 patients with severe COVID-19 (hypoxia and radiographically confirmed pneumonia), time to clinical improvement was not statistically different with remdesivir compared with placebo for 10 days (median 21 versus 23 days; hazard ratio for improvement 1.23 [95% CI 0.87-1.75]) [36]. Clinical improvement was defined as discharge from the hospital or a two-point improvement on a six-point clinical score that ranges from death to mechanical ventilation to lower levels of oxygen support to discharge. This study only included one patient who was on mechanical ventilation at baseline. Mortality at 28 days was also similar with remdesivir or placebo (14 versus 13 percent); there was also no difference in time to viral clearance. Among patients who had received treatment within 10 days of symptom onset, there were trends towards lower mortality and more rapid clinical improvement with remdesivir, but these differences were not statistically significant. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events (including gastrointestinal symptoms, aminotransferase or bilirubin elevations, and worsened cardiopulmonary status) in 12 percent, compared with 5 percent in the placebo group. Several limitations reduce confidence in the finding of no effect; concomitant therapies (lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon alpha-2b, and/or corticosteroids) were used by most study participants, patients in the remdesivir group had a higher proportion of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease), and the study was stopped early for poor enrollment (the target enrollment pre-determined to demonstrate effect was 435 patients). Early data suggest that 5 days of remdesivir result in similar outcomes as 10. In a preliminary report from the manufacturer of a randomized, open-label trial among nearly 400 patients with severe COVID-19 who were not on mechanical ventilation, the rates of clinical recovery and discharge by day 14 were not statistically different when remdesivir was given for 5 days (65 and 60 percent, respectively) versus 10 days (54 and 52 percent, respectively) [37]. Mortality rates at day 14 were 8 and 11 percent with 5 and 10 days of treatment, respectively, and varied by geographic location.Use of remdesivir has also been described in several case series [38-40]. In one multicenter, multinational series, 53 patients with severe COVID-19 and hypoxia received compassionate-use remdesivir for up to 10 days and had a median of 18 days of follow-up; 68 percent had clinical improvement (decreased requirement for oxygen support or hospital discharge), and 13 percent died [40]. Of the 30 patients who were mechanically ventilated at baseline, 17 (57 percent) were extubated, and three of four patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were taken off it. Reported side effects include nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations. In a preliminary report from a trial of remdesivir among patients with severe COVID-19, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations occurred in 7 percent and led to drug discontinuation in 3 percent [37]. Other adverse events described in patients who received remdesivir include worsening kidney injury, multiple organ failure, and worsened cardiopulmonary status [36,40]. Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine — There are insufficient data thus far to know whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has a role in treatment of COVID-19. For this reason, we strongly recommend that patients should be referred to a clinical trial whenever possible. In the United States, the FDA has issued an emergency use authorization to allow the use of these agents in adolescents or adults hospitalized for COVID-19 when participation in clinical trials is not feasible [41]. When a clinical trial is not available, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity. If drugs are used for COVID-19 outside a clinical trial, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) encourages creation of a registry, when possible, to systematically evaluate their safety and efficacy [42]. Additionally, if hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is used outside of a clinical trial, the potential for adverse effects should be carefully assessed. In particular, these agents can prolong the QT interval and should be avoided in patients with prolonged baseline QTc interval or on other agents that affect cardiac conduction, and otherwise should be used with close monitoring. The American College of Cardiology has suggested QTc monitoring parameters in this setting [43]. QTc monitoring in this setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Monitoring for QT prolongation'.)Other risks (eg, retinopathy or cardiomyopathy) are primarily with longer-term use and higher cumulative doses, but should be a consideration when deciding to use these agents. Catastrophic outcomes have been reported with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine overdose; no individual should use these medications without medical supervision [44,45]. (See ""Antimalarial drugs in the treatment of rheumatic disease"", section on 'Adverse effects'.)Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, although hydroxychloroquine appears to have more potent antiviral activity [46]. Randomized trials evaluating their clinical use are underway. However, published clinical data on either of these agents are limited, have methodologic problems, and do not suggest a clear benefit. In an open-label study of 36 adults with COVID-19, use of hydroxychloroquine (200 mg three times per day for 10 days) was associated with a higher rate of undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal specimens at day 6 compared with no specific treatment (70 versus 12.5 percent) [47], but there were substantial methodologic problems with this study that cast doubt on the conclusions [48]. In a randomized trial of 30 adults with COVID-19 in Shanghai, the proportion of patients with nasopharyngeal viral clearance at day 7 was not different with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily for 5 days) compared with standard of care, and one patient in the hydroxychloroquine group progressed to severe disease; interferon and other antiviral agents were used in both arms, which could be confounding factors [49]. Additionally, in an observational study of nearly 1400 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in New York, hydroxychloroquine use was reported in 811 patients and was associated with a higher risk of intubation or death (hazard ratio [HR] 2.37) [50]. Patients who received hydroxychloroquine were older, were more likely to have comorbidities, and had more severe illness than those who did not, which were likely confounding variables; in a multivariate analysis comparing those patients with a propensity score-matched subset of 274 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine, there was no association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (adjusted HR 1.04). Much of the clinical data evaluating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have not yet been published in peer-reviewed journals; these data are also mixed and inconclusive. In one unpublished randomized trial of patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia without hypoxia, adding hydroxychloroquine to standard of care resulted in a slightly faster time to improvement in fever, cough, and chest imaging findings and possibly a lower likelihood of progression to severe disease [51]. In another unpublished randomized trial of hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, adding hydroxychloroquine to standard of care did not improve the rate of SARS-CoV-2 clearance or symptomatic improvement by 28 days [52]. With both trials, there are methodologic concerns, including concomitant co-therapies, baseline differences between the groups, and lack of blinding or placebo control. Studies have, however, highlighted the potential for toxicity of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. One trial comparing two doses of chloroquine for COVID-19 was stopped early because of a higher mortality rate in the high-dose group [53]. QTc prolongation with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)'.)The evidence on the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Others' below.)Convalescent plasma — In the United States, the FDA is accepting investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 [54]; pathways for use through these applications include clinical trials, expanded access programs, and emergency individual use. Use of convalescent plasma has been described in case series [55-57]. One case series described administration of plasma from donors who had completely recovered from COVID-19 to five patients with severe COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation and persistently high viral titers despite investigational antiviral treatment [55]. The patients had decreased nasopharyngeal viral load, decreased disease severity score, and improved oxygenation by 12 days after transfusion. However, these findings do not establish a causal effect, and the efficacy of convalescent plasma remains unknown. In another case series of six patients who received convalescent plasma late in the course of illness, five died despite SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance within three days of treatment [57]. Finding appropriate donors and establishing testing to confirm neutralizing activity of plasma may be logistical challenges. In the United States, the American Red Cross is helping to collect and distribute convalescent plasma throughout the country [58]. (See ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)The FDA is also facilitating the evaluation of hyperimmune globulin for patients with COVID-19 [58]. IL-6 pathway inhibitors — Markedly elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin) and elevated proinflammatory cytokines (including interleukin [IL]-6) are associated with critical and fatal COVID-19, and blocking the inflammatory pathway has been hypothesized to prevent disease progression. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor inhibitor used for rheumatic diseases and cytokine release syndrome and is being evaluated in randomized trials for treatment of COVID-19. Case reports and observational studies have described use of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 [59-64]. In a study of 63 patients with severe COVID-19 who had laboratory results suggesting a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, no major adverse events were thought to be directly related to tocilizumab (given intravenously or subcutaneously), which was associated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin levels; overall, there was a 14-day mortality rate of 11 percent [64].Sarilumab and siltuximab are other agents that target the IL-6 pathway and are also being evaluated in clinical trials. Others●Favipiravir – Favipiravir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor that is available in some Asian countries for treatment of influenza, and it is being evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 in the United States. ●Interferon beta – There are no direct data evaluating the effect of interferon beta on SARS-CoV-2. However, interferon beta effectively reduces MERS-CoV in vitro and has resulted in good outcomes in an animal model of MERS-CoV infection [65-67].●Azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine – We do not use azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19. Although one study suggested the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine was associated with more rapid resolution of virus detection than hydroxychloroquine alone [47], this result should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size, substantial methodologic concerns [48], and unclear biologic plausibility. Another small observational study in patients with more severe illness did not suggest rapid viral RNA clearance with the combination [68]. Both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine are associated with QTc prolongation, and combined use may potentiate this adverse effect. ●Lopinavir-ritonavir – This combined protease inhibitor, which has primarily been used for HIV infection, has in vitro activity against the SARS-CoV [69] and appears to have some activity against MERS-CoV in animal studies [65]. However, lopinavir-ritonavir appears to have minimal to no role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of a clinical trial. The WHO has launched a multinational trial to further evaluate remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir with and without interferon beta [70]. Results from a randomized trial do not demonstrate a clear benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir. In a randomized trial of 199 patients with severe COVID-19, the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir (400/100 mg) twice daily for 14 days to standard care did not decrease the time to clinical improvement compared with standard care alone [71]. There was a trend towards decreased mortality with lopinavir-ritonavir (19 versus 25 percent), and the numerical difference in mortality was greater among those who were randomized within 12 days of symptom onset, but neither difference was statistically significant. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 decline was similar in the group that received lopinavir-ritonavir and the group that did not. Lopinavir-ritonavir was stopped early in 14 percent because of adverse effects. If lopinavir-ritonavir is used, the patient's HIV status should be known. If the patient has HIV, lopinavir-ritonavir should be used as a standard combination antiretroviral regimen. Many other agents with known or putative antiviral or immunomodulating effects have been proposed for use in patients with COVID-19 [72-76], and some are in preclinical or clinical evaluation. Use of these agents for COVID-19 should be limited to clinical trials; their efficacy has not been proven, and extensive off-label use may result in excess toxicity and critical shortages of drugs for proven indications. A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org, as well as on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. Approach — The optimal approach to treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Although some trial data suggest a benefit with remdesivir, these data are very preliminary and have not been formally peer reviewed or reported, and there are otherwise no therapies that have clearly proven effective; for most potential therapies, evidence for their use comes primarily from observational case series and anecdotal use based on in vitro or extrapolated indirect evidence.Thus, when available, we strongly recommend enrollment into a well-controlled clinical trial. Our approach is consistent with recommendations from expert groups in the United States. The IDSA recommends that COVID-19-specific therapy be given in the context of a clinical trial and additionally recommends certain therapies (including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and tocilizumab) only be administered in the context of a clinical trial because of a greater level of uncertainty or potential for toxicity [42]. Similarly, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel notes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any antiviral or immune-based therapy and specifically recommends against using certain therapies (including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, interferons, and Janus kinase inhibitors) outside the context of a clinical trial [4].A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org, as well as on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. We use a risk-based approach to try to enroll those patients who may be most likely to benefit. The approach is dependent on local availability of clinical trials and may not be universally applicable. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management.Defining disease severity — Mild disease is characterized by fever, malaise, cough, upper respiratory symptoms, and/or less common features of COVID-19, in the absence of dyspnea. Most of these patients do not need hospitalization. If patients develop dyspnea, that raises concern that they have at least moderate severity disease, and these patients often warrant hospitalization. Patients can have infiltrates on chest imaging and still be considered to have moderate disease, but the presence of any of the following features indicates severe disease: ●Hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤93 percent on room air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg)●Tachypnea (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute) or respiratory distress●More than 50 percent involvement of the lung parenchyma on chest imagingThese features were used in China to characterize severe disease in a large cohort of patients [77] and are consistent with the United States NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel definition of severe infection [4]. We also treat patients who have certain laboratory abnormalities (table 1) similar to patients who have severe disease, because these abnormalities have been associated with disease progression in several studies.Nonsevere disease — For most patients with nonsevere disease, we suggest supportive care only, with close monitoring for clinical worsening. If they develop features of severe disease (eg, hypoxia, tachypnea, or respiratory distress (see 'Defining disease severity' above)), or if they have any laboratory features associated with disease progression (table 1), we treat them as described below. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' below.)Some clinical trials may be available for patients with nonsevere disease. If so, we prioritize patients who have epidemiologic risk factors associated with development of severe illness (table 2). We generally do not treat patients with nonsevere disease with experimental agents outside the context of a clinical trial.Severe (including critical) disease — For hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 who have severe disease or have laboratory risk factors for disease progression (table 1), we recommend referral to a clinical trial of remdesivir, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, or other agents. (See 'Remdesivir' above and 'Convalescent plasma' above and 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above.)For patients with severe COVID-19 in the United States, remdesivir may be available through the FDA's emergency use authorization, and convalescent plasma may also be available through the FDA's investigational new drug application or expanded access program [54]. Additionally, features similar to cytokine release syndrome (eg, persistent fevers, elevated IL-6 and other cytokines, and elevated ferritin, D-dimer, and other inflammatory markers) have been associated with severe and fatal disease in patients with COVID-19 [59,60]. In patients with such features, the use of IL-6 pathway inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, siltuximab, and sarilumab, has been proposed to disrupt this proinflammatory response and improve outcomes, but published data are limited. Clinicians should explore the availability of clinical trials of IL-6 inhibitors for such patients at their location. (See 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors' above.) The optimal timing for implementation of these therapies is unknown. Until more data are available, it remains uncertain which patients would benefit most (if at all) from any of them and how best to allocate potentially limited clinical trial slots. There are insufficient data to know whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has a role in treatment of COVID-19; thus we strongly recommend that patients be referred to a clinical trial whenever possible. When a clinical trial is not available, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity. If drugs are used for COVID-19 outside a clinical trial, the IDSA encourages creation of a registry, when possible, to systematically evaluate their safety and efficacy [42]. (See 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above.)MANAGEMENT OF HYPOXIA, ARDS, AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS — Patients with severe disease often need oxygenation support. High-flow oxygen and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation have been used, but the safety of these measures is uncertain, and they should be considered aerosol-generating procedures that warrant specific isolation precautions. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Respiratory care of the nonintubated patient'.) Some patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and warrant intubation with mechanical ventilation. Management of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and other critical care issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".) In addition to ARDS, other complications of infection include arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, thromboembolic events, and shock. Management of these complications is discussed elsewhere. ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Acute kidney injury'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)INSTITUTIONAL PROTOCOLS — Several academic medical institutions in the United States have developed COVID-19 management protocols that are publicly available. Given the paucity of high-quality clinical evidence on the management of COVID-19, the safety and efficacy of these strategies are uncertain: ●Brigham and Women's Hospital●Massachusetts General Hospital●Michigan Medicine●Nebraska Medicine●Penn Medicine●University of Washington MedicinePartners in Health has also released resources for clinicians and organizations in resource-limited settings. SPECIAL SITUATIONSPregnant and breastfeeding women — The management of pregnant and breastfeeding women with COVID-19 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Pregnant and breastfeeding women'.)People with HIV — Data on the impact of HIV infection on the natural history of COVID-19 are limited [78]. However, many of the comorbid conditions associated with severe COVID-19 (eg, cardiovascular disease) occur frequently among patients with HIV, and these, in addition to CD4 cell count, should be considered in risk stratification. Additionally, drug interactions with antiretroviral agents are important to assess before starting any new therapies. Otherwise, the management of COVID-19 in patients with HIV is the same as in patients without HIV; HIV should not be a reason to exclude a patient from clinical trials or other interventions [79]. Lopinavir-ritonavir is being used in trials for patients with COVID-19, although data from one randomized trial do not suggest a benefit [71]. If a patient with HIV is not on a protease inhibitor-containing regimen, it should not be changed to include a protease inhibitor outside the context of a clinical trial and without consultation with an expert in the management of HIV [80].SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The optimal approach to treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Our approach is based on limited data and evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Many patients with known or suspected COVID-19 have mild disease that does not warrant hospital-level care. Having such patients recover at home is preferred, as it prevents additional potential exposures in the health care setting and reduces burden on the health care system. Identification of patients who can be managed in the outpatient setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●The evaluation of hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 should assess for features associated with severe illness and identify organ dysfunction or other comorbidities that could complicate potential therapy (table 2). (See 'Evaluation' above.)●Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. COVID-19 has been associated with thromboembolic complications. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●There are minimal data informing the risks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the setting of COVID-19. We suggest acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, if possible (Grade 2C). If NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose. We do not discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions if there are no other reasons to stop them. (See 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' above.)●Specific concern for COVID-19 should not impact the decision to start or stop angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). People who are on an ACE inhibitor or ARB for another indication should not stop their medication. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)●We make a point of continuing statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are already taking them. (See 'Statins' above.)●The optimal use of COVID-19-specific therapy is uncertain; very preliminary, unpublished trial data suggest a benefit of remdesivir, but no other agent has clearly proven effective. For most potential therapies, evidence on their use is low quality. For this reason, patients should be referred to clinical trials whenever possible. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management. (See 'Approach' above.)•For patients with nonsevere disease who have no laboratory features associated with severe disease (table 1), care is primarily supportive, with close monitoring for disease progression. If a clinical trial is available for such patients, we prioritize those with advanced age (eg, >65 years) and other comorbidities associated with risk of progressive disease (table 2). (See 'Defining disease severity' above and 'Nonsevere disease' above.)•For patients with severe (including critical) disease or with laboratory features associated with severe disease (table 1), we strongly recommend referral to a clinical trial of remdesivir, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, or other agents (Grade 1C). (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' above and 'Remdesivir' above and 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above and 'Convalescent plasma' above.)When a clinical trial is not available, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity (Grade 2C). We do not use azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' above and 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above.)•For critically ill patients who have features similar to cytokine release syndrome, interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors have been proposed to disrupt the proinflammatory response. Clinical trials of IL-6 inhibitors are underway at some locations. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' above.) •We suggest not using lopinavir-ritonavir for COVID-19 therapy outside of a clinical trial (Grade 2B).●Patients with severe disease often need oxygenation support.

ID:127419,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues,"INTRODUCTION — A novel coronavirus was identified in late 2019 as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It has since rapidly spread resulting in a pandemic. The World Health Organization designated the disease term COVID-19 (ie, Coronavirus Disease 2019) [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The major morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 is largely due to acute viral pneumonitis that evolves to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of patients who become critically ill due to COVID-19. Other aspects of COVID-19, and other coronavirus-related diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)GUIDELINES AND HOSPITAL POLICIES — The advice in this topic is based upon data derived from the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, emerging retrospective data in patients with COVID-19, expert opinion, and anecdotal observations of clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 in China, Italy, and Washington state (USA), where the large outbreaks have occurred. Guidelines have been issued by several societies and organizations including the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the Chinese Thoracic Society, the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS), the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health [2-7]. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)Learning from regions that have dealt with the overwhelming burden of COVID-19 to date, it is essential that all hospitals and health systems develop task forces to manage patients admitted with this disorder. This involves, but is not limited to, designating COVID-19-specific intensive care units (ICUs) and ICU teams, creating back up and expanded staffing schedules, utilizing detailed protocols for infection prevention and medical management, accessing research trials for patients with COVID-19, ensuring adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies and training, forecasting demand, and prioritizing diagnostic lab testing.EPIDEMIOLOGY — Reports suggest that among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), up to 20 percent develop severe disease requiring hospitalization [8-15]. Although rates vary, among those who are hospitalized, up to one-quarter need intensive care unit (ICU) admission, representing approximately 5 to 8 percent of the total infected population. Differences in the rates of ICU admission may relate to cultural differences in practice and admission criteria for ICU as well as differences in predisposing factors such as age and comorbidities and testing availability in the populations served.  ●China – In the Chinese cohorts, rates of ICU admission or severe illness ranged from 7 to 26 percent [9,10,15,16]. ●Italy - Consistent with the range reported in China, preliminary reports from Italy suggest that the proportion of ICU admissions were between 5 and 12 percent of the total positive SARS-CoV-2 cases, and 16 percent of all hospitalized patients [17,18]. ●United States of America – In an early study of 21 critically ill patients in Washington State, USA, 81 percent of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the ICU and 71 percent were mechanically ventilated [19]. However, this high rate likely reflects the older age of the population which largely came from a nursing home in the region. A larger analysis of 2449 patients reported hospitalization rates of 20 to 31 percent and ICU admission rates of 4.9 to 11.5 percent [20].While three-quarters of critically ill patients were male in the Chinese cohorts, data are mixed with some reports suggesting an equal proportion of men and women [18,19] and other suggesting a male predominance [21,22]. CLINICAL FEATURES IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTSClinical features, complications, and pathology — General clinical features of COVID-19 patients and risk factors for progression are discussed separately (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'). Discussion here is limited to clinical features in those who are critically ill.●Rate of progression – Retrospective studies of critically ill patients have suggested that among patients who develop critical illness, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), onset of dyspnea is relatively late (median 6.5 days after symptom onset), but progression to ARDS can be swift thereafter (median 2.5 days after onset of dyspnea) [9,10,19,23,24]. ●Clinical features – Among those who are critically ill, profound acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS is the dominant finding [8-10,19,21,22,24-28]. Hypercapnia is rare. Fevers tend to wax and wane during ICU admission. The need for mechanical ventilation in those who are critically ill is high ranging from 30 to 100 percent [9,19,21,22,25,28]. ●Length of stay – Early clinical reports suggest that length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay appears to be long with many patients remaining intubated for one to two weeks or longer [22]. Reports from experts in the field suggest that many patients fail early attempts at weaning (eg, within the first week), although this does not appear to predict their eventual ability to wean and extubate. Only a small proportion of patients require tracheostomy. (See 'Extubation and weaning' below and 'Tracheostomy' below.)●Complications – Common complications of COVID-19-related ARDS include acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated liver enzymes, and cardiac injury including cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. As an example, in a single-center retrospective cohort from China of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, complications included AKI (29 percent; half of whom needed renal replacement therapy), liver dysfunction (29 percent), and cardiac injury (23 percent) [9]. •Cardiac injury appears to be a late complication, developing after the respiratory illness improves. A high rate of cardiomyopathy was noted in a United States cohort (33 percent), and may relate to the older age in that population [19]. In another United States cohort in New York City, cardiac complications among mechanically ventilated patients included atrial arrhythmias (18 percent), myocardial infarction (8 percent), and heart failure (2 percent) [27]. One case series reported five patients who developed acute cor pulmonale, most of which occurred in association with hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest [29]. All cases were thought to be most likely due to pulmonary embolism (PE), although a definitive diagnosis of PE was confirmed in only one case. Cardiac complications of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)•Sepsis, shock, and multi-organ failure do occur but appear to be less common when compared with non-COVID-19-related ARDS. The need for vasoactive agents is variable, although a significant proportion need vasopressor support for hypotension (often due to sedation medications or cardiac dysfunction). In the cohort study from Wuhan, China, 35 percent of 52 patients received vasoactive agents [9]. In contrast, in the case series from New York City, 95 percent of the 130 patients who received mechanical ventilation required vasopressor support; the reasons for this were not specified [27]. •As above, acute kidney injury is common among critically ill patients with COVID-19, and many require renal replacement therapy. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Acute kidney injury'.)•Data on the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia are limited, but it does not appear to be a major feature of COVID-19. In a cohort of intubated patients from China, hospital-acquired pneumonia, in many cases with resistant pathogens, was reported in 12 percent [9]. This finding may be related to the high use of glucocorticoids for ARDS management in China. Further data are needed to elucidate the rate of superinfection in other countries.  •Lung compliance is high compared with other etiologies of ARDS and the rate of barotrauma appears to be low with only 2 percent developing pneumothorax, compared with 25 percent of those with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [9,30]. There are limited data describing the lung pathology in patients with COVID-19. Case reports from post mortem cases and patients undergoing biopsy for another reason suggest a wide variation from mononuclear inflammation to diffuse alveolar damage, classic of ARDS [31,32]. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and etiology in adults"", section on 'Pathologic stages'.)•Neurologic complications in critically ill patients are common, especially delirium or encephalopathy which manifests with prominent agitation and confusion along with corticospinal tract signs (hyperreflexia). Consistent with this, intensivists have observed that sedation requirements are high in this population, particularly immediately after intubation. In one series of 58 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, delirium/encephalopathy was present in approximately two-thirds of patients [33]. In addition, three of 13 patients who had brain MRI had an acute ischemic stroke; eight MRI studies demonstrated leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in seven patients was acellular and only one had elevated CSF protein; PCR assays of CSF were negative for the virus. It is unclear whether the neurologic complications noted in this and other reports are due to critical illness, medication effects, or represent more direct effects of cytokines or the SARS-CoV-2 virus [33-35]. Encephalitis, while reported, is rare [36]. Similarly, Guillain-Barré-barre syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has also been described in a small case series [37]. •COVID-coagulopathy is common in this population with some patients developing abnormal coagulation profiles and other developing thrombosis. These features are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●Laboratory – Laboratory findings in critically ill patients (eg leukopenia, lymphopenia, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, normal or low procalcitonin) are initially modest and similar to those with milder illness, although the procalcitonin level may be more elevated and lymphopenia more profound in critically ill patients [8,10,26]. (See ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings' and ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)Some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin, interleukin-6), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines; these laboratory abnormalities have been associated with poor prognosis [38]. Clinical trials of anti-IL-6 agents for the treatment of COVID-19 are in progress. Further details regarding CRS are provided separately. (See ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings' and ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.) The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies has also been described; however, they are mostly of the IgA subclass, and the clinical significance is unclear [39]. Abnormal coagulation parameters which are commonly seen in COVID-19 patients (eg, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time) are also discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"" and ""Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome"".)●Imaging – Typical imaging findings do not appear to be different in mild or severe cases of COVID-19 (eg, ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia, minimal or no pleural effusions) [9,40,41]. While imaging with chest computed tomography (CT) was commonly performed in Chinese cohorts, we prefer to avoid its use, unless necessary; if chest CT is used as a diagnostic tool, its use must be balanced with the risk to other patients and healthcare workers during the process of patient transport and time spent in the CT room. Characteristic findings on bedside lung ultrasound include thickening of the pleural line and B lines supporting alveolar consolidation. Pleural effusions are unusual [42]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.) ●Pathology – There are a paucity of data describing lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia in critically ill patients. Most autopsy reports describe hyaline membrane changes and microvessel thrombosis suggestive of early ARDS (ie, exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage [DAD]) [32,43-48]. Other findings include bacterial pneumonia (isolated or superimposed on DAD) and viral pneumonitis [44,48]. Less common findings include acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia (AFOP; in the late stages) [49], amyloid deposition (heart and lung), and rarely alveolar hemorrhage and vasculitis [48]. Evidence of pulmonary embolism is found in up to one-third of autopsy cases [44,48]. Distant organ involvement has also been seen with the demonstration of virus in organs other than the lung and, in some cases, acute tubular necrosis and a generalized thrombotic microangiopathy in the kidney [44,48]. (See ""Interpretation of lung biopsy results in interstitial lung disease"", section on 'Diffuse alveolar damage'.)Risk factors for progression — Age appears to be the major risk factor that predicts progression to ARDS [12,19,20,25]. Comorbidities, high fever (≥39°C), history of smoking, and select laboratory features also predict progression and death from COVID-19. Importantly, adults of any age may develop severe disease and experience adverse outcomes, especially those with comorbidities. Further details regarding the risk of disease progression are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)RESPIRATORY CARE OF THE NONINTUBATED PATIENT — Specific aspects of respiratory care relevant to deteriorating patients with COVID-19 before admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) are discussed here (table 1). These include oxygenation with low flow and high-flow systems, noninvasive ventilation and the administration of nebulized medications. For hospitalized patients who develop progressive symptoms, early admission to the ICU is prudent when feasible. Self-proning — Some experts are encouraging that the hospitalized patient spend as much time as is feasible and safe in the prone position while receiving oxygen; the rationale for this approach is based upon limited direct evidence [50,51] and anecdotal observations in the field as well as indirect evidence of its efficacy in ventilated patients. (See 'Prone ventilation' below.)Oxygenation targets — The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests titrating oxygen to a target peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of ≥90 percent. For most critically ill patients, we prefer the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting a SpO2 between 90 and 96 percent, if feasible. However, some patients may warrant a lower target (eg, patients with a concomitant acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) and others may warrant a higher target (eg, pregnancy). (See ""Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Fraction of inspired oxygen'.) Low flow oxygen — For patients with COVID-19, supplemental oxygenation with a low flow system via nasal cannula is appropriate (ie, up to 6 L/min). Although the degree of micro-organism aerosolization at low flow rates is unknown, it is reasonable to surmise that it is minimal. Higher flows of oxygen may be administered using a simple face mask, venturi face mask, or nonrebreather mask (eg, up to 10 to 20 L/minute), but as flow increases, the risk of dispersion also increases, augmenting the contamination of the surrounding environment and staff. Many experts have patients who wear nasal cannula also wear a droplet mask, especially during transport or when staff are in the room. Data to support this practice are largely non-peer-reviewed or derived from simulation experiments but make practical sense as a maneuver to reduce the infectious risk associated with potential aerosolization [52-54]. Additional information on the provision of low flow oxygen is provided separately. (See ""Continuous oxygen delivery systems for the acute care of infants, children, and adults"".)Patients with higher oxygen requirements — As patients progress, higher amounts of oxygen are needed. Options at this point in non-COVID-19 patients are high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) or the initiation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). However, in patients with COVID-19, this decision is controversial and subject to ongoing debate [55,56]. Despite this controversy, both modalities have been used variably. In retrospective cohorts, rates for HFNC use ranged from 14 to 63 percent while 11 to 56 percent were treated with NIV [9,22,25,28]. While, there are no prospective data describing whether these modalities were successful at avoiding intubation, one retrospective study described the highest level of respiratory support in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was noninvasive modalities (HFNC and NIV) in 5.4 percent of patients and invasive ventilation in 30 percent [28].   Deciding on a modality (noninvasive or invasive ventilation) — We believe that the decision to initiate noninvasive modalities, HFNC or NIV, should be made by balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of resources; this approach should be reassessed as new data become available. We encourage the development of hospital protocols and a multidisciplinary approach, which includes respiratory therapy staff, to facilitate this decision. In patients with COVID-19 who have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and higher oxygen needs than low flow oxygen can provide, we suggest that noninvasive modalities, may be used selectively rather than proceeding directly to intubation (eg, a younger patient without comorbidities who can tolerate nasal cannulae). On the other hand, some patients may warrant avoidance of HFNC and may benefit from proceeding directly to early intubation (eg, elderly or confused patient with comorbidities and several risk factors for progression). Many experts advocate the avoidance of both modalities (ie, proceeding to early intubation if escalating beyond 6 L/min with continued hypoxemia or increased work of breathing). This is predicated on an increased risk of aerosolization and high likelihood that patients who need these modalities will ultimately, rapidly deteriorate and require mechanical ventilation (eg, within one to three days). This approach may be reasonable when resources are available. However, using this as an absolute rule may result in an excess of unnecessary intubations and place an undue load on ventilator demand as the disease surges. In addition, this is particularly problematic for patients under investigation (eg, COVID-19 testing pending), patients who have chronic nocturnal NIV requirements, patients with chronic respiratory failure who have high baseline oxygen requirements, and patients with do-not-intubate status but who might benefit otherwise from NIV or HFNC. Ultimately, these recommendations may change with time depending on the case load of COVID-19 patients in a given location.   Oxygen via high flow nasal cannula versus noninvasive ventilation — Among the noninvasive modalities, we prefer HFNC. Our preference for HFNC is based upon limited and inconsistent data, which, on balance, favor HFNC compared with NIV in patients with non-COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the details of which are provided separately (see ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure'). In addition, limited data suggest a high failure rate of NIV in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [57] and other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (see ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure NOT due to ACPE'). However, NIV may be appropriate in patients with indications that have proven efficacy; these include patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and patients with sleep disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation). These data are provided separately. (See ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'.)  Monitoring on noninvasive modalities — If HFNC or NIV is administered, vigilant monitoring of patients is warranted for progression with frequent clinical and arterial blood gas evaluation every one to two hours to ensure efficacy and safe ventilation (eg, frequent coughing may not be “safe”). We advocate a low threshold to intubate such patients, particularly if they show any signs of rapid progression. (See 'Timing' below.)Although unproven, some experts, including us, provide HFNC (or NIV) while the patient is in the prone position. Limited evidence from case reports in non-COVID patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and anecdotal evidence suggest feasibility and improvement in oxygenation in some patients [50,58,59].  Technical details regarding application of HFNC and NIV are provided separately. (See ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"" and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Practical aspects of initiation"" and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"".)Precautions for noninvasive modalities — HFNC and NIV are considered aerosol generating procedures. Thus, when HFNC or NIV is used, airborne in addition to standard precautions should be undertaken (ie, airborne infection isolation room [also known as a negative pressure room], full personal protective equipment). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●HFNC – We advocate additionally placing a surgical or N95 mask on the patient during HFNC when healthcare workers are in the room, but the value of this practice is unknown [3]. Additional precautions for HFNC that have potential to reduce risk include starting at and using the lowest effective flow rate (eg, 20 L/minute and 0.4 FiO2). Inhaled medications or gases (eg, epoprostenol, nitric oxide bronchodilators) should be avoided during HFNC. ●NIV – If NIV is initiated, a full-face mask rather than a nasal or oronasal mask is preferred to minimize particle dispersion. The mask should preferably have a good seal and not have an anti-asphyxiation valve or port. Use of a helmet has been proposed for delivering NIV to patients with COVID-19 [60]. However, experience is limited with this delivery method, especially in the United States. If NIV is used, dual limb circuitry with a filter on the expiratory limb on a critical care ventilator may decrease dispersion compared with single limb circuitry on portable devices, although data to support this are lacking. We also suggest starting with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) using the lowest effective pressures (eg, 5 to 10 cm H2O).There are few data regarding aerosolization during HFNC and NIV. In a normal lung simulation study, dispersion of air during exhalation increased with increasing HFNC flow from 65 mm (at 10 L/minute) to 172 mm (at 60 L/minute) mostly along the sagittal plane (ie, above the nostrils) [61]. Similar distances were found when CPAP was delivered via nasal pillows (up to 332 mm with CPAP 20 cm H2O). However, there was no significant leakage noted when CPAP was administered via an oronasal mask with good seal (picture 1 and picture 2). Air leak increased when connections on any device were loose. Dispersion seemed to be reduced when the simulator simulated injured lung. Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients) — Nebulizers are associated with aerosolization and potentially increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In patients with suspected or documented COVID-19, nebulized bronchodilator therapy should be reserved for acute bronchospasm (eg, in the setting of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation). Otherwise, nebulized therapy should generally be avoided, in particular for indications without a clear evidence-base; however some uses (eg, hypertonic saline for cystic fibrosis) may need to be individualized. Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) with spacer devices should be used instead of nebulizers for management of chronic conditions (eg, asthma or COPD controller therapy). Patients can use their own MDIs if the hospital does not have them on formulary.If nebulized therapy is used, patients should be in an airborne infection isolation room, and healthcare workers should use contact and airborne precautions with appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE); this includes a N95 mask with goggles and face shield or equivalent (eg, powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR] mask]) as well as gloves and gown. All non-essential personnel should leave the room during nebulization. Some experts also suggest not re-entering the room for two to three hours following nebulizer administration. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Other — Potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should inform the use of other interventions in patients with documented or suspected COVID-19: ●It is prudent to minimize the following: •Positive airway devices for chronic nocturnal ventilation support•Chest physical therapy or oscillatory devices•Oral or airway suctioning●Sputum induction should be avoided●Bronchoscopy should be avoided in spontaneously breathing patients and limited to therapeutic indications (eg, life-threatening hemoptysis, central airway stenosis)If any of these therapies are performed, similar PPE to that described for nebulizer therapy should be used. (See 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)' above and ""Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview"".) THE DECISION TO INTUBATETiming — Timing of intubation in this population is challenging. Most patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 will warrant intubation and mechanical ventilation. Delaying intubation until the patient acutely decompensates is potentially harmful to the patient and healthcare workers and is not advised. For patients with escalating oxygen requirements, we monitor clinical and gas exchange parameters every one to two hours and have a low threshold to intubate patients with the following:●Rapid progression over hours  ●Lack of improvement on >40 L/minute of high flow oxygen and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) >0.6●Evolving hypercapnia, increasing work of breathing, increasing tidal volume, worsening mental status ●Hemodynamic instability or multiorgan failureMost experts with experience managing COVID-19 patients suggest “early” intubation. However, the definition of what constitutes “early” is unclear. Use of noninvasive means are traditionally used to avoid intubation. However, their use is subject to controversy in patients with COVID-19 (see 'Patients with higher oxygen requirements' above). Clinicians should communicate closely and regularly about the potential for intubation in patients that are being followed and treated noninvasively so that the transition for intubation can be smooth and rapid once it has been identified that the patient needs intubation.  Precautions — Intubation is the highest risk procedure for droplet dispersion in patients with COVID-19 [55,62]. The following discussion is suitable for patients outside the operating room (eg, intensive care unit [ICU] and emergency department) (table 2). ●We are proponents of the development of intubation kits and intubation checklists for performing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in this population (figure 1). ●Attention should be paid to donning full contact and airborne personal protective equipment (PPE) (figure 2 and figure 3) [55]. Appropriate PPE includes a fit-tested disposable N95 respirator mask (picture 3), with eye protection or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), also known as an isolation suit (picture 4 and picture 5). Also included are gown, caps and beard covers, protective footwear, neck covering, and gloves (using the double glove technique). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●Intubation should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room, if possible.●Intubation should be performed by the most qualified individual (eg, anesthesiologist) since delayed intubation with multiple attempts may prolong dispersion and place the patient at risk of a respiratory arrest.  ●Anecdotally, most experts suggest optimizing preoxygenation with nonaerosol-generating means (eg, avoidance of high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannula) and intubation using video laryngoscopy. In patients previously on high flow oxygen, some experts switch to 100 percent nonrebreather masks for preoxygenation. ●When manual bag mask ventilation (BMV) is needed, switching the mask to a supraglottic device for manual bagging is appropriate. When feasible, BMV should be minimized before and after intubation, and a bacterial/viral high efficiency hydrophobic filter should be placed between the facemask and breathing circuit or resuscitation bag. Having a pre-prepared bag-mask with filter attached in every room with a COVID-19 patient is prudent. Using a two-person technique for an adequate face mask seal is also suggested.●Clamping the endotracheal tube (ETT) for connections and disconnections is appropriate (eg, capnography testing following intubation), only if the patient is NOT spontaneously breathing. ●The ventilator and ventilator circuitry should be ready in advance with preplanned settings already entered so that as soon as the ETT is placed and confirmed with capnography, it can be connected directly to the ETT without additional manual bagging. In addition, if feasible, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy should be prepared and attached to the ventilator tubing in advance in order to avoid unnecessary disconnection for their placement at a later point in time. The expiratory limb on the ventilator should have a HEPA filter to decrease contamination of the ventilator and environment and protect staff when changing limb circuitry. ●To minimize exposure, bundling intubation with other procedures is appropriate as is bundling the chest radiograph for ETT and central venous catheter placement.●Doffing should follow strict procedure and some experts also advocate for the use of viricidal wipes for areas of exposed skin during intubation (eg, neck) (figure 3).New proposals are emerging for novel barrier protections for intubation. In one such pilot study, manually performing intubation inside a transparent box was described (“aerosol box”) [63]. The box was designed so that it could be placed over a patient’s head allowing intubation to be performed through two circular ports on the cephalad side of the box. In a simulation experiment, cough was approximated using a latex balloon and fluorescent dye. Use of the box was associated with significant reduction in aerosol deposition to the individual performing intubation, their PPE clothing, and the surrounding environment, when compared with the same simulation without the box. While proposed as an adjunct to protection, restriction of hand movements may be encountered during airway manipulation that would necessitate abandoning the procedure and the simulation may not accurately mimic the aerosolization behavior of virus particles. Such devices are not yet commercially available.  Detailed guidance regarding intubation in the operating room, optimal personal protective equipment, and procedural details regarding intubation itself are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"" and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19' and ""Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults"" and ""Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room"" and ""The decision to intubate"" and ""Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room"" and ""Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside of the operating room"".)VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME — Most patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated appear to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Accurate data on duration of ventilation are limited but suggest prolonged mechanical ventilation for two weeks or more (table 1). All of the steps discussed below should proceed as resources allow. Whether different phases of COVID-19 pneumonitis require different ventilatory strategies is unclear. One school of thought is that in the early phase of COVID-19, severe hypoxemia is associated with high compliance and low alveolar recruitability (atypical ARDS), while in the later phase, severe hypoxemia is associated with low lung compliance and high recruitability (classic ARDS) [64,65]. However, this hypothesis, remains unproven and optimal ventilatory strategies based upon it are unclear. Until further data are available, we prefer a strategy that promotes lung protection as outlined in the sections below.Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) — As for all patients with ARDS, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who develop ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation should receive LTVV targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW; range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW (table 3 and table 4)). We typically use a volume-limited assist control mode, beginning with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW, which targets a plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤30 cm H2O, and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table (table 5). This approach is based upon several randomized trials and meta-analyses that have reported improved mortality from LTVV in patients with ARDS. The experience among Chinese, Italian, and United States cohorts is that this approach is also beneficial in this population. Modifications to or deviations from this mechanical ventilation strategy may be required in the setting of severe hypercapnia or ventilator dyssynchrony (figure 4). (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Patients who are not improving or deteriorating'.)Anecdotal reports suggest that the COVID-19 ARDS phenotype is one of severe hypoxemia that is responsive to high PEEP with relatively high lung compliance such that Pplat ≤30 cm H2O is not difficult to achieve. As a consequence, we and other clinicians have a low threshold to start with higher than usual levels of PEEP (eg, 10 to 15 cm H2O).Expanded details on LTVV and other ventilator strategies in ARDS are provided separately. (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"".)   We believe that oxygenation goals in critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be similar to those in nonventilated patients (ie, peripheral oxygen saturation between 90 and 96 percent (see 'Oxygenation targets' above)). However, in patents with COVID-19, some experts use a higher peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) goal [7]. The rationale for this approach is that it may reduce the frequency of ventilator adjustments that require staff entry into the room, thereby reducing the risk to healthcare staff, although data are lacking to support it.Reflecting the practice of LTVV, one retrospective Italian cohort reported that the median level of PEEP was 14 cm H2O (interquartile range [IQR] 12 to 16 cm H2O) [22]. Ninety percent of patients required an FiO2 >0.5, and the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 160 (IQR, 114 to 220).Failure of low tidal volume ventilation — For patients with COVID-19 that fail to achieve adequate oxygenation with LTVV, we agree with other experts in the field who have chosen prone ventilation as the preferred next step. For its application, we use similar criteria to those in non-COVD-19 patients (ie, partial arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2:FiO2] ratio <150 mmHg, a FiO2 ≥0.6, and PEEP ≥5 cm H2O; excessively high airway pressures; or recalcitrant hypoxemia), although some experts use a higher PaO2:FiO2 ratio, given the good response seen in this population.  Prone ventilation — Our preference for using prone ventilation is based on its known efficacy in patients with ARDS as well as limited and anecdotal observations of intensivists in the field who have noted that unlike patients who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), patients with COVID-19-related ARDS respond well to this maneuver [66]. Those who are experienced in ventilating patients with COVID-19-related ARDS also promote ventilating patients prone for as long as is feasible without prematurely returning the patient to the supine position (ie, 12 to 16 hours prone per day) and to perform the maneuver at change of shift when sufficient staff are available. The utmost care should be taken to avoid ventilator disconnections during proning and the number of personnel should be limited to that required for turning. This video which describes the prone procedure is freely available. Additional details regarding the efficacy, contraindications (table 6) and application (table 7) of prone ventilation are provided separately. (See ""Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Ventilator strategies to maximize alveolar recruitment'.) The good response to prone positioning may be due to preserved lung compliance in this population compared with patients who develop ARDS from other etiologies. Lung compliance is the change in lung volume for a given pressure. It can be measured using the following equations: lung compliance (C) = change in lung volume (V) / change in transpulmonary pressure (alveolar pressure [Palv] – pleural pressure [Ppl]); static lung compliance = tidal volume / Pplat – PEEP. The normal lung compliance is approximately 200 mL/cm H2O and in general compliance >50 mL/cm H2O has been noted by clinicians who have experienced ventilating patients with COVID-19. Optimal timing and criteria for discontinuing prone ventilation is unclear and should be performed on an individualized basis. It is not unreasonable to use criteria similar to that in studies that have shown benefit in non-COVID-related ARDS (eg PaO2:FiO2 ≥150 mmHg, FiO2 ≤0.6, PEEP ≤10 cm H2O) maintained for at least four hours after the end of the last prone session) [67].Additional options — Additional options for patients in whom prone ventilation fails include the following:●Recruitment and high PEEP – Recruitment maneuvers and high PEEP strategies (table 8) may be performed to address severe hypoxemia; data supporting their use in non COVID-19-related ARDS is described separately. (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Ventilator strategies to maximize alveolar recruitment'.)●Pulmonary vasodilators – Pulmonary vasodilators may improve ventilation-perfusion mismatch in those with severe hypoxemia and may be particularly helpful in those with hypoxemia from an acute pulmonary arterial hypertension crisis. The two most commonly used agents are inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and inhaled prostacyclin, which are administered as a continuous inhalation. Inhaled vasodilators should only be administered through a closed system and require skilled personnel for their use. Potential risks and challenges with COVID-19 patients include aerosolization and clogging of bacterial/viral filters used in ventilator circuits when these medications are being administered. Inhaled NO may be preferred since it is associated with a lower need to change filters with resultant reduction in the risk to the respiratory healthcare provider. Further details regarding their use are described separately. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Nitric oxide' and ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Prostacyclin' and ""Inhaled nitric oxide in adults: Biology and indications for use"", section on 'Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure'.) ●Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) – NMBAs may be reserved for patients with refractory hypoxemia or ventilator dyssynchrony. We do not favor their routine use in any patient with ARDS since data on outcomes are conflicting. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Paralysis (neuromuscular blockade)' and ""Neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients: Use, agent selection, administration, and adverse effects"".) ●Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – While the World Health Organization suggests ECMO as a rescue strategy, we only use it in those who fail prone ventilation and the other evidence-based medical strategies listed above. In addition, ECMO is not universally available. As many hospitals choose to cohort patients in COVID-19-only intensive care units (ICUs), there may also be the challenge of delivering ECMO in ICUs that do not routinely care for ECMO patients; this would require the recruitment of additional specialized nursing and perfusionist staff. ECMO can also reduce the lymphocyte count and raise the interleukin-6 level, thereby interfering with the interpretation of these laboratory results [68]. (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Use of rescue strategies has varied among centers. In a single-center retrospective cohort of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, approximately 12 percent received prone ventilation and 12 percent received ECMO [9]. In contrast, in the original cohort of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, of the 17 patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, 24 percent were treated with ECMO. Similarly, in an Italian cohort, only 1 percent of critically ill patients received ECMO [22]. Additional ventilator precautions — We recommend tight seals for all ventilator circuitry and equipment. For patients who have a tracheostomy, similar recommendations apply. Although the efficacy is unproven, some experts suggest placing the ventilator and intravenous (IV) line monitors outside the room, when feasible (eg, through a wall port). This allows frequent ventilator adjustments while simultaneously decreasing the risk of exposure to staff; although the efficacy of such maneuvers is unproven. It is prudent to avoid unnecessary disconnection with the endotracheal tube (ETT) in ventilated patients with COVID-19 in order to avoid derecruitment and unnecessary exposure of virus to the environment. For example, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy are preferred, if resources allow. If disconnection is necessary (eg, during transfer when portable ventilators are used or manual bagging), the ETT should be temporarily clamped during disconnection and unclamped after reconnection. This is considered an aerosolizing procedure in which case an airborne infection isolation room is preferable but is not always feasible.Other infection precautions include use of dual limb ventilator circuitry with filters placed at the exhalation outlets as well as heat moisture exchange (HME) systems rather than heated humification of single limb circuits. HME should be placed between the exhalation port and the ETT (figure 5 and figure 6). (See ""The ventilator circuit"".)It is particularly important to adhere to the standard practice of maintaining the ETT cuff pressure between 25 and 30 cm H2O so that a tight seal exists between the cuff and the tracheal wall. (See ""Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients"", section on 'Maintain optimal cuff pressure'.)All ventilators should have appropriate filters in place and agreed upon filter change schedule (eg, every six hours). The ventilator should be wiped down after every filter change. Although an airborne isolation room is ideal, if not feasible, patients can be ventilated in a non-isolation room but need to be transported to an airborne isolation room when aerosol generating procedures take place (eg, extubation, bronchoscopy). Having a protocol in place for transport is prudent. INTERVENTIONS — Ventilated patients require frequent evaluation and develop complications that require intervention. Details relevant to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are included in this section and mostly relate to infectious precautions. In a biodistribution study of 1070 specimens obtained from 205 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens showed the highest positive rates (93 percent), followed by sputum (72 percent), nasal swabs (63 percent), fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (46 percent), pharyngeal swabs (32 percent), feces (29 percent), and blood (1 percent). No urine specimens tested positive [69]. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in several specimens, although the reported rates in this study may have been determined by the severity of illness of the individual tested. In a systematic review of 10 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to healthcare workers, endotracheal intubation had the highest risk (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 2.3-18.9), followed by noninvasive ventilation (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.8), tracheostomy (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5-11.5), and bag-mask ventilation [70]. Other procedures were associated with a lower or insignificant risk of transmission but it is not known whether they can be applied to SARS-CoV-2. For example, duration of close contact during aerosolizing procedures and precautions used were not described. Collection of respiratory specimens in the intubated patient — Some intubated patients require upper or lower respiratory tract sampling for diagnostic purposes (eg, diagnosis of COVID-19 or ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]). Technically, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs do not have to be taken under airborne precautions. However, we prefer to obtain naso-and oropharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates under airborne precautions in the intensive care unit (ICU). Nonbronchoscopic alveolar lavage (“mini-BAL”) may also be performed as an alternative to bronchoscopy, although experience in this procedure is not universal among ICUs. If mini-BAL is performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, use of smaller aliquots of lavage fluid is prudent (eg, three 10 mL aliquots to obtain 2 to 3 mL of fluid). (See ""Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia"", section on 'Invasive respiratory sampling'.)Bronchoscopy — We agree with the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) that bronchoscopy should have a limited role for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and should only be performed for this indication when upper respiratory samples are negative (ie, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, or non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage) and the suspicion remains high. Bronchoscopy may also be performed when another diagnosis is being considered and a bronchoscopic sample would change management (eg, suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii in an immunosuppressed patient) or when therapeutic bronchoscopy is indicated (eg, life-threatening hemoptysis or airway stenosis).  Bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure and should only be performed when necessary and likely to change management. Bronchoscopy through an established airway (eg, endotracheal tube [ETT]) likely carries less risk than bronchoscopy in a spontaneously breathing patient. In patients with COVID-19, bronchoscopy should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room. Airborne precautions and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned before entering the room. Using PPE similar to that described for intubation is appropriate. (See 'The decision to intubate' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Using ETTs with inline adapters for bronchoscopy is ideal to prevent disconnection from the ventilator and aerosolization. If bronchoscopy is needed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, then we suggest small aliquots of 10 mL to obtain 2 to 3 mL of lavage fluid placed in a sterile leak-proof container. Clamping suction tubing or turning off suction after the sample has been obtained before disconnecting the sample from the device is also prudent. Specimens should be in a double zip-locked sealed plastic bag, handled with the usual precautions, and labelled clearly as “COVID-19.”We prefer the use of disposable bronchoscopes, although these are not universally available. For nondisposable equipment, we recommend cleaning the suction channels with standard cleaning solutions typically used for highly infectious material. We also suggest covering or sealing any vessel containing the bronchoscope during transport after use and wiping down the transport cart and bronchoscope display tower before leaving the room. Wipe down solution should be hydrogen peroxide or equivalent and should be left wet on all surfaces for at least one minute. Extubation and weaning — Patients are often ready for extubation while they remain infectious, and because extubation is frequently associated with some coughing, it is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. Similar to intubation, we encourage the use of extubation protocols and check lists specific to each institution.●Weaning – Readiness for extubation should follow standard practice of performing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). However, COVID-specific approaches include the following:•Equipment – We suggest using closed systems and not using a T-piece trial for SBTs.•SBTs – To reduce the risk of reintubation following extubation, we prefer a higher degree of readiness in patients with COVID-19. This practice varies and may include higher criteria for passing an SBT. For example, some experts use lower pressure support ventilation [PSV] parameters (eg, 0 to 5 cm H2O) rather than the typical 7 cm H2O during the trial while others promote SBT for longer periods (eg, two to four hours rather than the typical two hours). The rationale for altered criteria is based upon the observation that patients with COVID-19 are intubated for longer periods than non-COVID-patients [22] and anecdotal evidence that suggests a high volume of secretions and airway edema; all of these factors place the patient at high risk of post extubation respiratory failure requiring reintubation. In addition, we prefer extubating patients directly to low-flow oxygen rather than high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae (HFNC) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV), which may risk virus aerosolization. (See ""Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing"" and ""Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation"", section on 'Spontaneous breathing trial' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Cuff leak test – Whether the cuff leak test (CLT) should be performed routinely prior to extubation is unclear. However, its performance may be guided by clinical suspicion for upper airway edema (eg, fluid overload) or the presence of risk factors for post extubation stridor (eg, prolonged intubation ≥6 days, age >80 years, large endotracheal tube, traumatic intubation). Performing the cuff leak test should be weighed against the potential risk of aerosolization, and similar to extubation, it should be preferentially done in an airborne isolation room. In our institution, we routinely administer glucocorticoids (eg, methylprednisolone 20 mg intravenously every four hours for a total of four doses) to most patients with COVID-19 before extubation and only extubate those in whom the CLT is positive after glucocorticoids. We base this practice upon the high rate of airway edema noted in our population but understand that practice may vary depending upon the population served. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Cuff leak'.)●Extubation – We prefer to perform extubation in an airborne isolation room. Respiratory therapists and others in the room during extubation should adhere to airborne precautions including N95 masks with eye protection or equivalent. In general, only two people are needed and extra staff outside the room should be available to help with additional equipment. Some experts use medications to decrease coughing (eg, lidocaine via ETT, low-dose opioid bolus, dexmedetomidine, remifentanil if available), although data to support the routine use of anti-tussives are limited. In the ICU, close communication with a clinician experienced in intubation regarding the occurrence of extubation in a COVID-19 patient is prudent, in case rapid reintubation is needed, particularly for patients pre-designated as having a difficult airway.Both low-flow and high-flow oxygen systems should be set up and readily available. We drape the patient’s chest and face with a plastic cover to provide barrier protection between the patient and the operator (eg, a plastic poncho). We typically put the ventilator in standby mode (or switch off) immediately prior to extubation. After balloon deflation, extra care should be taken during extubation to keep the inline suction catheter engaged during cuff deflation and to have another handheld suction catheter available for the removal of pharyngeal and oral sections. The endotracheal tube should be removed as smoothly as is feasible during inspiration, and disposed of into a biohazard plastic bag bundled together with the ventilator tubing, the plastic drape, and tape/ETT holders, and inline suction catheter. The bag is sealed and disposed of immediately. Further details regarding extubation are provided separately. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Extubation equipment and technique'.)●Post-extubation care – The patient is monitored following the procedure. The threshold to reintubate patients with postextubation respiratory failure should be low. Postextubation care should support the application of supplemental oxygen at the lowest fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) possible, preferably via low flow nasal canula. Because patients are often extubated while they remain infectious, we would advise adhering to a similar approach to oxygen delivery as before intubation. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Postextubation management' and 'Oxygenation targets' above.)The procedure for palliative extubation should be similar except care following extubation also includes palliative medication and cessation of neuromuscular blockade. Precautions for extubation in the OR are provided separately. (See ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)  Tracheostomy — Reports from experts in the field suggest that many patients fail early attempts at weaning (eg, within the first week), although this does not appear to predict their eventual ability to wean and extubate. However, some patients require tracheostomy (in our experience <10 percent of ICU admissions). ●Indications – Indications appear to be similar to non-COVID patients (eg, failed extubation, secretion management, airway edema, neurological impairment such as that which impairs airway protection).●Timing – The optimal timing for tracheostomy is unknown in COVID-19 patients. In non-COVID patients, changes in practice have led to most intensivists performing tracheostomy around day 7 to 10 following initial intubation. Although most intensivists perform tracheostomy approximately 7 to 10 days following initial intubation in patients without COVID-19, it seems reasonable to defer tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 beyond this time frame. COVID-19 patients appear to require mechanical ventilation longer than other patients (eg, two to three weeks), but can still be successfully extubated after this point.  ●Procedure – Tracheostomy is considered a high risk procedure for aerosolization. •Both open and percutaneous tracheostomy procedures are acceptable in COVID patients. •The exact procedure should be determined in advance and at the discretion of the operator with the minimum number of personnel. •To minimize cough, neuromuscular blockade is prudent. •It is preferable that the procedure be done at the bedside in an airborne isolation room. The operator should wear appropriate PPE similar to other aerosol generating procedures. The tracheostomy tube should have the syringe attached for immediate balloon inflation once inserted. In addition, adapters with inline suction catheters attached is also appropriate. (See 'Precautions' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)•Procedures such as open suctioning, dressing changes, inner cannula care, and tracheostomy changes are also considered as aerosol-generating. Thus, post tracheostomy care should also occur in an airborne isolation room, if feasible (if not, consider a portable HEPA-filtration unit). Novel barrier protections for performing tracheostomy have been proposed. In one report, tracheostomy was performed under an aerosol-reduction cover with a high-efficiency particulate air filtration unit placed close to the surgical field [71]. However, no description of aerosol deposition was provided. ●Prolonged weaning – Tracheostomy collar trials can be safely done in an airborne isolation room with resumption of ventilation and a closed loop system following the trial. However, some institutions use a portable HEPA filter to generate negative pressure in a room or use closed systems and dual limb circuitry with a HEPA filter attached to the exhalation limb to minimize environmental contamination. A surgical mask over the tracheostomy itself may also theoretically limit droplet spread.  Once a patient can breathe for 24 hours on a tracheostomy collar (or similar), they can undergo trials of a speaking valve and “capping” with the balloon deflated. Placing a speaking valve and capping would be considered aerosol generating so airborne precautions are warranted. However, once a speaking valve is in place or the tracheostomy is capped, aerosolization is less of a consideration and is the equivalent of a patient with a cough and on low flow oxygen and the patients may wear a mask over their nose and mouth. Decannulation is considered an aerosol-generating procedure, and provided the patient remains infectious, all the usual airborne precautions should be taken.  ●Repeat testing – Some institutions perform repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine when to discontinue infection control precautions and inform resource allocation. Whether tracheal or nasopharyngeal swabs should be used for this purpose is uncertain. If patients are tested and have a positive test, we continue precautions until two tests collected 24 hours apart are negative; however, it remains uncertain whether viral RNA detection during recovery reflects transmissible infection. (See 'Precautions' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.) .  Further details regarding tracheostomy are provided separately. (See ""Overview of tracheostomy"".)Cardiopulmonary resuscitation — In the event of a cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should proceed with all members of the team wearing appropriate PPE. Practicing a test run of a COVID-19 patient cardiac arrest is prudent. Bag-mask ventilation should be avoided (if feasible); the ventilator can be used instead to deliver a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute (bpm). Guidance for advanced cardiac life support and CPR in patients who are prone and cannot be returned to the supine position is provided separately. (See ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)' and ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"".)Other interventions — Guidance is lacking regarding other procedures commonly performed in the ICU. Many intubated patients have routine indications for central venous and arterial access for monitoring and for vasoactive drug infusion. Grouping standard procedures such as central venous catheter and arterial lines immediately following intubation is appropriate to minimize the frequency of exposure. The transmission risk of blood is unknown but likely to be low [69]. Significant pleural effusions and barotrauma appear to be unusual as a manifestation of COVID-19. In general, emergently indicated procedures and interventions should be performed as indicated, with appropriate infectious precautions. (See 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)  Transfer of COVID-19 patients should be limited to necessary trips (eg, imaging for a diagnosis that would change management, travel to an airborne isolation room for high risk aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation and extubation). SUPPORTIVE CARE — General supportive care of the critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is similar to that in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to other causes and is discussed in detail separately. Select issues pertinent to COVID-19 are discussed in the sections below. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Supportive care'.) Routine measures — The supportive care of mechanically ventilated patients that also apply to patients with COVID-19 are provided in several linked topics. However, potential differences that may pertain to COVID-19 patients are discussed in this section:Venous thromboembolism prevention — We agree with the American Society of Hematology and the Society of Critical Care Medicine that routine pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is warranted, preferably with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; eg, enoxaparin 40 mg SC once daily), unless there is a contraindication (eg, bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia). (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults"".)Because the risk of VTE appears to be higher than usual in this population, use of more aggressive VTE prophylaxis in the form of increased intensity of a pharmacologic agent (eg, enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, unfractionated heparin 7500 units every eight hours) and/or the addition of a mechanical device is prudent. Markedly elevated D-dimer levels, which correlate with a poor prognosis, are used by some experts to guide intensification of anticoagulation (eg, >6 times the upper limit of normal). For patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute, enoxaparin should be reduced to 30 mg daily or changed to unfractionated heparin depending on the severity of kidney impairment and patient weight. Fondaparinux is appropriate in those with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We believe that administering therapeutic anticoagulation (as a form of prophylaxis) may be assessed on an individual basis. However the indications for therapeutic anticoagulation, outside of documented VTE, are unclear but may include those with presumed VTE (eg, sudden unexplained deterioration in oxygenation or hemodynamic instability, acute cor pulmonale) and clotting of vascular devices (eg, venous, arterial devices, and hemodialysis devices).  Detailed descriptions of the VTE risk and management of COVID-19 patients with hypercoagulability are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)Sedation and analgesia — Anecdotal evidence suggests that requirements for sedation and analgesia appear high in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and that heavy use of sedatives and analgesic medication is required for ventilator synchrony. In our practice, we target a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS (table 9)) of -1 to -2 (or similar on a different scoring system), and in patients with ventilator dyssynchrony, a RASS of -2 to -3. RASS of -4 to -5 are targeted in those with severe dyssynchrony and those requiring neuromuscular blockade. For those requiring intravenous (IV) infusions, propofol and fentanyl are generally the preferred agents. However, shortages of sedatives may influence the choice of agent. We also quickly transition to oral medications, provided that fluid resuscitation is adequate (eg, oxycodone, hydromorphone, lorazepam, diazepam). Further details regarding indications, daily awakening, protocols, and dosing are provided separately. (See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal"" and ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects"" and ""Pain control in the critically ill adult patient"".)Others — Other supportive measures are included here.●Nutritional support – The same principles of nutrition in non COVID-19 critically ill patients should be applied to critically-ill COVID-19 patients. We are not proponents of extra protein supplementation, vitamin C or D supplementation, or trace element supplementation over and above the usual recommended daily doses. (See ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview"" and ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition"" and ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition"".)●Glucose control. (See ""Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness"".)●Stress ulcer prophylaxis. (See ""Stress ulcers in the intensive care unit: Diagnosis, management, and prevention"" and ""Management of stress ulcers"".)●Hemodynamic monitoring. (See ""Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults"" and ""Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults"" and ""Novel tools for hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill patients with shock"".)●Fever management. (See ""Fever in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Outcomes'.)●Early physical therapy. (See ""Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)"", section on 'Prevention and treatment'.)●Ventilator-associated pneumonia precautions. (See ""Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"".)Monitoring for complications — Critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be followed routinely for the development of complications associated with critical illness from COVID-19 or extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only essential personnel should enter the rooms of infected patients when performing daily examinations, care, and procedures. Common complications include acute kidney injury, mild transaminitis, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusions, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and superinfection (eg, ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]) (see 'Clinical features, complications, and pathology' above). We suggest that daily laboratory studies include complete blood count with differential, chemistries, liver function and coagulation studies, arterial blood gases, ferritin level, D-dimer level, and lactate dehydrogenase. Serial measurement of cardiac troponins and a low threshold transthoracic echocardiogram may be helpful to evaluate for suspected cardiac injury.Daily chest radiographs are not recommended routinely for mechanically ventilated patients with or without COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated, chest radiographs should only be performed when there is an indication (eg, catheter- or endotracheal tube [ETT]-placement or a relevant clinical change). Chest computed tomography and other imaging should be limited to those in whom testing would change management. This rationale is based upon the increased risk of viral shedding with procedures that require transfer out of the intensive care unit (ICU). (See ""Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients"", section on 'Reassessment of position'.) Fluid and electrolytes management — Unless patients have sepsis or volume depletion from high fever or gastrointestinal losses, we prefer conservative fluid management typical of that advised for patients with ARDS. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Fluid management' and ""Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"", section on 'Intravenous fluids (first three hours)' and ""Treatment of severe hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults"".)The management of patients who present with septic shock due to COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with septic shock from other causes. (See ""Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"".)Glucocorticoids — We agree with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) that glucocorticoids should not be routinely administered to patients with COVID-19, unless there is a separate evidence-based indication (eg, asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation, refractory septic shock, and adrenal insufficiency). However, their administration in critically ill patients with COVID-19-related ARDS is controversial. Based on data suggesting potential benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with all-cause ARDS, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) provides a conditional, weak recommendation in favor of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19 who have severe ARDS (eg, patients with a partial arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2:FiO2] <100 mmHg). Although we also weakly recommend glucocorticoids in moderate to severe “all cause” ARDS (ie, non COVID-19-related ARDS) who fail low tidal volume ventilation, we do not suggest administering them routinely in the setting of COVID-19 and ARDS (see ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'). The rationale for not administering glucocorticoids in this population is that the data supporting any benefit did not include a sufficient proportion of patients with viral pneumonia to inform safety (eg, patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East Respiratory syndrome [MERS], or influenza); this is especially important since data in patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia were conflicting and some suggested harm [72-75]. If clinicians choose to administer glucocorticoids, the SCCM suggests that they should begin within the first 14 days, doses should be low, and courses should be short (eg, intravenous dexamethasone 20 mg IV once daily for five days, then 10 mg once daily for five days). Data in COVID-19 patients are limited to a single retrospective Chinese cohort, where methylprednisolone administration reduced the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients who did not receive methylprednisolone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38; 95% CI 0.2-0.71) [25]. However, these data are fundamentally flawed and new data gathered prospectively should shed light on this controversial issue. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)As noted above, management of patients who present with shock due to COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with septic shock from other causes (see 'Fluid and electrolytes management' above). Low dose glucocorticoids are not routinely advised for septic shock. In the setting of COVID-19 and shock, we reserve low dose glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone 200 to 400 mg/day in divided doses) for selected patients with refractory shock, in accordance with guidelines [7]. Low dose glucocorticoids are not routinely advised for non-refractory septic shock. The use of glucocorticoids in septic shock is discussed separately. (See ""Glucocorticoid therapy in septic shock in adults"", section on 'Administration'.)Nebulized medication — Nebulization is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. For patients with COVID-19 who are intubated and require bronchodilators for an evidence-based indication (eg, acute bronchospasm from asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation), we prefer the use of in-line metered dose inhalers (MDIs; ie, pressurized inhalers) rather than administration via a standard jet or vibrating mesh nebulizer due to the lower risk of aerosolization associated with MDIs [76,77]. For medications that can only be administered via a nebulizer, consideration should be given to stopping the medication if it is not essential for acute care (eg, inhaled colistin for patients with bronchiectasis) or using an MDI alternative, if available on formulary (eg, tobramycin capsule inhaler). Consideration should be given to the patient using their own supply if MDIs are not on formulary. Placement of a filter at the expiratory port of the ventilation circuit during nebulization is prudent to minimize aerosolization into the room. Ideally, patients who require nebulizers, should be in an airborne infection isolation room. Only the healthcare staff necessary for nebulizer administration (eg, respiratory therapists or nurse) should be in the room for the initiation of the procedure and airborne precautions similar to those for intubation should be taken. (See 'The decision to intubate' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Investigational COVID-19 agents — Several investigational agents have been proposed and individual institutions should work with their pharmacists and clinical researchers to enroll patients in clinical trials. We suggest the development of protocols by individual ICUs for the off-label use of investigational agents. This area is rapidly evolving and is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Management of co-infections and comorbidities — Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are intubated are at risk for developing VAP and other infections typical of all critically ill and/or intubated patients (eg, central line or urinary tract infections). When treating co-infections, potential drug interactions with any investigational COVID-19 agent should be assessed. Infectious disease experts should be involved early in the management of COVID-19 patients who are critically ill. Further details regarding management of chronic medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and angiotensin receptor inhibitors are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Managing chronic medications'.)SPECIAL POPULATIONS — There are no specific recommendations for pregnant women who are critically-ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. Management should be similar to uninfected patients. Issues regarding transmission and risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women is described separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Pregnant and breastfeeding women' and ""Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period"" and ""Acute respiratory failure during pregnancy and the peripartum period"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".) In patients with sickle cell disease who are critically-ill with COVID-19 in whom acute chest syndrome is contributing to their illness, consideration of early exchange transfusions and surveillance for the development of acute pulmonary hypertension is prudent [78]. (See ""Acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease"", section on 'COVID-19'.)Issues that arise for other populations are provided in the following links:●Renal issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"")●Cardiac issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"")●Airway management and operating room issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"")●Cancer care (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"")PROGNOSISMortality — Early data are emerging describing outcomes from COVID-19 in critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2,8-10,21,22,24-26]. Mortality appears lower than that in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The mortality from COVID-19 appears driven by the presence of severe ARDS, and is approximately 50 percent (range 16 to 78 percent).●In a single-center retrospective cohort of 52 critically ill Chinese patients with COVID-19, 62 percent had died by 28 days with a median duration of only seven days from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to death [9]. Among the 20 patients who survived, three remained on mechanical ventilation, three were receiving noninvasive mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC), and six were receiving low flow oxygen. ●In a retrospective cohort of 201 Chinese patients with COVID-19, the mortality was 52 percent among those who developed ARDS [25]. Among those who received mechanical ventilation, 66 percent died, 21 percent were discharged and 13 percent remained hospitalized. ●In a preliminary study of 21 critically ill patients in the United States, by day 5, 67 percent of critically ill patients had died, 24 percent remained critically ill, and 9.5 percent were discharged from the ICU [19]. ●In an Italian cohort of 1591 patients, the ICU morality was 26 percent, but a significant proportion remained in the ICU at the time of the publication, which may have underestimated the true mortality [22]. Higher mortality was initially reported in males compared with females but this may have been due to the predominance of males affected with COVID-19 in the Chinese cohorts [8-10,25,26]; a similar difference has been noted in the preliminary reports from Italy but not from Washington state, USA [18,19]. Risk factors for death — Across countries, the consistent major risk factor associated with death in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is older age [9,10,17,20,22,24,25]. In two Chinese retrospective cohorts, death from ARDS was more likely to occur in those of older age ≥64 years (hazard ratio [HR] 6.17; 95% 3.26-11.67) [9,25]. Preliminary reports from Italy and the United States are reporting similar outcomes [17,18,20]. Other risk factors associated with death among critically ill patients include the following [9,10,17,20,22,24,25,79]:●The development of ARDS, particularly severe ARDS, and the need for mechanical ventilation●Comorbidities (eg, chronic cardiac and pulmonary conditions, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease)●Markers of inflammation or coagulation (eg, D-dimer level >1 microg/mL admission, elevated fibrin degradation products, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times)●Select laboratory studies (eg, worsening lymphopenia, neutrophilia)The rapidity of symptom progression does not appear to predict a worse outcome [9]While high fever was associated with a higher likelihood of developing ARDS (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.11-2.84), it appears to be associated with a lower likelihood of death (HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21-0.82) [9,25], a phenomenon that has been noted previously in some critically ill patients. (See ""Fever in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Outcomes'.) Further details on the risk factors associated with severe disease are provided separately. (See 'Risk factors for progression' above.)Long term sequelae — The percentage of patients that require long term care is unreported. Similarly, the incidence of critical care neuromyopathy is not yet documented. In our experience the rate may be higher than usual due to the prolonged nature of intubation in COVID-19 patients and higher use of neuromuscular blockade and sedatives, with or without concurrent glucocorticoid administration. (See ""Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness"".)The incidence of post-intensive care unit syndrome (PICS) is also unknown in COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, patients should be followed and treated for PICS which involves nutritional, physical, psychological, and occupational therapy. (See ""Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)"".)END OF LIFE ISSUES — In a public health emergency, values other than autonomy predominate. Like any critical illness, severe illness due to COVID-19 carries the potential of significant psychosocial distress to patients, families, and surrogates. In addition, unique aspects of COVID-19 and its management portend greater trauma including anxiety and stigma surrounding a novel pathogen and high-level isolation precautions including visitation limitation or prohibition including at the end of life. High levels of patient, family, and surrogate psychosocial distress should be anticipated and combatted with clear communication strategies and early palliative care involvement. Even if in-person visitation is not allowed due to public health care concerns, hospitals should promote internet based visual communication such as video communication between clinicians, families, and isolated patients.   Discussing end-of-life wishes with patients and their family should occur early in the course of management, including potentially even before diagnosis, especially in light of the poor outcomes for elderly patients with comorbidities who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require mechanical ventilation. Consultation with the palliative care teams and ethic experts should also be done to assist families in decision-making and assist clinicians with contentious issues or disagreement that may arise. Due to the unique aspects to addressing needs of patient and families in this pandemic, several online resources are available for clinicians to use when having COVID-19 specific discussions with patients and families. They provide helpful language and strategies for conversations about a range of issues including, but not limited to, triaging, discussing goals of care, resource allocation, and grieving including:●VIITALtalk ●Center to Advance Palliative Care ●National Coalition for Hospice an Palliative Care Further principles regarding ethical issues in the intensive care unit (ICU) and advance care planning are discussed separately. (See ""Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults"" and ""Ethics in the intensive care unit: Informed consent"" and ""Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit"" and ""Communication in the ICU: Holding a family meeting"" and ""Palliative care: Issues in the intensive care unit in adults"" and ""Advance care planning and advance directives"", section on 'COVID-19 resources'.)DISCHARGE AND LONG TERM CARE — For patients who extubate successfully and can be safely discharged home, routine community precautions apply. For patients who require a tracheostomy or are deconditioned from critical illness, transfer to a long term acute care (LTAC) facility is typical. However, there is no guidance on whether or when patients should be re-tested. Many, but not all, LTACs require two negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests performed 24 hours apart before accepting a patient with COVID-19. If positive testing delays transfer to an LTAC, continued infection control precautions are advised, and rehab and weaning should begin at the acute care facility. Discontinuation of infection control precautions is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.) Outcomes in patients who require long term care are unknown. Treatment of patients who require admission to an LTAC should be similar to non-COVID patients. Particular attention should be paid to continuing venous thromboembolism prophylaxis until the acute illness fully resolves or the patient become mobile, although the efficacy of this approach is unknown. Duration of therapeutic anticoagulation should be guided by the indication; for example, a minimum of three months for documented or presumed VTE is appropriate while shorter durations are reasonable for device thrombosis. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".) The management of patients who require long term mechanical ventilation is discussed separately. (See ""Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation"".)SURGE CAPACITY AND SCARCE RESOURCE ALLOCATION — COVID-19 is a global pandemic and has placed significant increases in demand for acute and critical care services on hospitals in many regions. This has necessitated operations maneuvers to increase capacity to be able to provide care for more patients, for more higher acuity patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation, and for patients with special isolation requirements. Surge capacity may be achieved by maximizing resources across three domains: ●Care spaces (ie, beds)●Staff●Physical equipmentIn the COVID-19 pandemic, this has included expanding ICU care into non-ICU spaces, utilizing non-critical care trained staff to participate in delivering critical care, and innovative approaches to obtain, conserve, and increase the efficiency of physical equipment including personal protective equipment (PPE; eg, repeat use of N95 masks) and mechanical ventilators (eg, double ventilation, repurposing operating room ventilators). As an example, some experts have published preliminary data to highlight the use of one ventilator for use in multiple patients [80]. However, this maneuver was designed for a disaster setting where one might reasonably expect that several patients might need life support at similar levels. Use of this measure as a life-saving measure in patients with COVID-19 could be complicated if patients are not matched well in terms of their ventilator settings. Potential use of anesthesia ventilators for longer-term mechanical ventilation is provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines"".)In some instances, such as in Italy, despite mobilizing to surge capacity, demand for care has still outpaced supply such that overt rationing has occurred [81]. All hospitals facing the potential of an acute surge event due to COVID-19 or another insult should have a process to approach the allocation of scarce resources such as ICU beds and mechanical ventilators. Most individual states in the United States have guidance documents which can be adapted for local institutions [82]. General principles that guide and underpin scarce resource allocation policies include: ●Maximization of lives saved and/or life-years saved●Transparency ●Stakeholder and public input●Separation between the clinical team and the triage process (eg, ethics committees for difficult triage decisions)●Robust palliative care and supportive measures for patients who are not provided with critical care resourcesSOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), up to one-quarter require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. (See 'Introduction' above and 'Epidemiology' above.)●Profound hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the dominant finding in critically ill patients. Common complications include acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated liver enzymes, and the late development of cardiac injury, including sudden cardiac death. Sepsis, shock, and multi-organ failure are less common. (See 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' above.) ●For most critically ill patients with COVID-19, we prefer the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting a peripheral oxygen saturation between 90 and 96 percent. (See 'Respiratory care of the nonintubated patient' above and 'Oxygenation targets' above and 'Low flow oxygen' above.)•The use of high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is controversial based on infection control concerns and the frequent need for mechanical ventilation despite these measures. The decision to initiate noninvasive modalities requires balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of resources; this approach should be reassessed as new data becomes available. (See 'Patients with higher oxygen requirements' above.) •In patients with COVID-19 who have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and higher oxygen needs than low flow oxygen can provide, we suggest selective use of noninvasive measures rather than routinely proceeding directly to intubation (Grade 2C). As an example we might trial HFNC in younger patients without comorbidities who can tolerate nasal cannulae. In contrast, we may proceed directly to early intubation in patients at higher risk (eg, elderly patients and patients with comorbidities or risk factors for progression). •Among the noninvasive modalities we suggest HFNC rather than NIV (Grade 2C). Our preference for HFNC is based upon limited and inconsistent data, which, on balance, favors HFNC compared with NIV in HFNC in patients with non-COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. NIV via a full face mask (with a good seal) may be appropriate in patients with indications that have proven efficacy including acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and sleep disordered breathing. (See ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure' and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'.).•For patients with COVID-19 who receive HFNC or NIV, vigilant monitoring is warranted for progression with frequent clinical and arterial blood gas evaluation every one to two hours to ensure efficacy and safe ventilation. The threshold to intubate such patients should be low. ●For critically ill patients with COVID-19, intubation should not be delayed until the patient acutely decompensates since this is potentially harmful to both the patient and healthcare workers. We have a low threshold to intubate those who have (see 'Timing' above):•Rapid progression over a few hours•Failure to improve despite HFNC >40 L/min and FiO2 >0.6•Development of hypercapnia•Hemodynamic instability or multiorgan failure ●Intubation is a high risk procedure for aerosol dispersion in patients with COVID-19 and attention should be paid to donning full personal protective equipment (PPE) with airborne precautions (figure 2 and figure 3) as well using equipment that minimizes dispersion (eg, video laryngoscopy) and the development of protocols for the procedure (eg, check lists) (table 2 and figure 1). (See 'Precautions' above and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)●We use low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) (range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW (table 3 and table 4)) that targets a plateau pressure ≤30 cm H2O and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table (table 5). For patients with COVID-19 who fail LTVV, prone ventilation is the preferred next step (table 7 and table 6). (See 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome' above and ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".) ●Several procedures, including the collection of respiratory specimens, bronchoscopy, extubation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are aerosol-generating and should be avoided or minimized, if possible. All procedures should be grouped when possible. (See 'Interventions' above.)●Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are mechanically ventilated for ARDS should receive the usual daily surveillance, and supportive care including conservative fluid management (unless patients have sepsis or volume depletion) (table 1). Measurement of surveillance cardiac troponins and a low threshold to perform transthoracic echocardiography is appropriate for the early detection of cardiac injury. (See 'Supportive care' above and 'Monitoring for complications' above.) •In critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS who do not have a specific indication (eg, acute bronchospasm or refractory septic shock), we suggest not administering glucocorticoids (Grade 2C). The rationale for not administering glucocorticoids in this population is that the data supporting any benefit in the non-COVD-19 population did not include a sufficient proportion of patients with viral pneumonia to inform safety and that data in patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], influenza) suggested harm. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'.) •For acute bronchodilation, we prefer the use of in-line metered dose inhalers (MDIs) rather than administration via a standard jet or vibrating mesh nebulizer due to the lower risk of aerosolization associated with MDIs. Individual institutions should work with their pharmacy regarding compassionate use of investigational medications and trial enrollment. We suggest the development of protocols by individual ICUs for the off-label use of investigational agents. (See 'Nebulized medication' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)●For patients with COVID-19 who develop ARDS, the prognosis is poor with mortality ranging from 52 to 67 percent. The highest rates of death occur in those ≥64 years. (See 'Prognosis' above.)●A greater level of anxiety and trauma among patients and families should be anticipated and combatted with clear communication strategies and early palliative care involvement. Precautions should continue if the patient continues to test positive for COVID-19 before discharge to a long term acute care facility. (See 'End of life issues' above and 'Discharge and long term care' above.)●Several measures should be adopted to accommodate a surge in COVID-19 cases including included expanding ICU care into non-ICU spaces, utilizing non-critical care trained staff to participate in delivering critical care, and innovative approaches to obtain, conserve, and increase the efficiency of physical equipment (eg, personal protective equipment and mechanical ventilators).

ID:127535,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues,"INTRODUCTION — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Information about COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, and interim guidance by multiple organizations is constantly being updated and expanded. This topic will discuss issues related to COVID-19 during pregnancy and delivery.VIROLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY — General issues regarding the virology, geographic distribution, route of transmission, period of infectivity, and immunity of SARS-CoV-2 are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)Vertical transmission is addressed below. (See 'Vertical transmission' below.)PREVENTION — Pregnant women should follow the same recommendations as nonpregnant persons for avoiding exposure to the virus (eg, social distancing, hand hygiene, disinfecting surfaces). Women with epidemiologic history of contact should be monitored. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.)Pregnant women with children should exercise caution. COVID-19 in children is usually mild and may be asymptomatic, although severe cases have been reported. Given the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or presymptomatic individuals within the incubation period) [1-7], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that children not have playdates with children from other households; that they remain ≥6 feet from people from other households when playing outside; and that they wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain [8]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Should play dates and playgrounds be avoided?'.) Pregnant health care workers have additional concerns, and there is no standard occupational guidance for them. Some human resources units suggest that those in the third trimester, particularly ≥36 weeks, stop face-to-face contact with patients to help reduce their risk of acquiring infection and its consequences. More commonly, they give pregnant health care workers the option of reassignment or limiting their exposure to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures). The International Society of Infectious Disease in Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests that pregnant women working in high-risk exposure settings (eg, labor and delivery, operating room, respiratory wards, intensive care or high dependency units) transfer to low-risk exposure settings, especially if they are >24 weeks of gestation [9].CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS — All pregnant women should be monitored for development of symptoms and signs of COVID-19, particularly if they have had close contact with a confirmed case or persons under investigation. In a systematic review including 356 cases in pregnant women (33 studies), the most frequent symptoms were fever (67 percent), cough (66 percent), dyspnea (7 percent), sore throat (7 percent), fatigue (7 percent), and myalgia (6 percent) [10]. Rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, headache, and possibly abnormalities in smell and/or taste have also been reported. Laboratory findings included lymphopenia (14 percent), modest increase in liver enzymes (5 percent), and thrombocytopenia (1 percent) [10]. These clinical manifestations are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)Complications of infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shock. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)Classification of disease severity — In the United States, the National Institutes of Health have categorized disease severity as [11]:●Asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection – Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 but no symptoms.●Mild illness – Any signs and symptoms (eg, fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain) without shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging.●Moderate illness – Evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) >93 percent on room air at sea level.●Severe illness – Respiratory frequency >30 breaths per minute, SaO2 ≤93 percent on room air at sea level, ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300, or lung infiltrates >50 percent.●Critical illness – Respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.Disease severity has also been categorized as (Wu classification) [12]:●Mild – No or mild symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough, and/or less common features of COVID-19).●Severe – Tachypnea (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute), hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤93 percent on room air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg), or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging).●Critical (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Defining disease severity'.)COURSE IN PREGNANCYMaternal course — Available data from multiple small series generally suggest that pregnancy and childbirth do not increase the risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, do not worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 compared with nonpregnant individuals of the same age, and most infected mothers recover without undergoing delivery [12-24]. The patient group most commonly affected by severe disease includes older adults (>60 years), particularly with comorbidities, and most pregnant women are younger than middle age; however, they may have comorbid conditions that increase their risk (eg, hypertension, diabetes, severe obesity, severe asthma, serious heart disease, immunocompromise). It is known that some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response (similar to cytokine release syndrome), which has been associated with critical and fatal illnesses. Whether the normal immunologic changes of pregnancy affect the occurrence and course of this response is unknown. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications'.)In pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia, early data show approximately the same rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions as in the nonpregnant population but an increased risk of preterm and cesarean delivery. (See 'Pregnancy complications' below.)●A preliminary report from the United States indicated 4 of 143 pregnant COVID-19 patients (2.8 percent) were admitted to an ICU, but these data were incomplete [25]. ●In an initial United States experience from New York City including 43 pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19, the disease course was mild in 37 (86 percent), severe in 4 (9.3 percent), and critical in 2 (4.7 percent) [13]. ●In a larger cohort of 147 pregnant patients in the WHO-China Joint Mission Report and a separate report of 118 pregnant patients in Wuhan, the illness was severe in 8 percent and critical in 1 percent [16]. These percentages are similar to those of nonpregnant, reproductive-age adults [12,26].Severe sequelae of maternal infection include prolonged ventilatory support and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [27].A single maternal death from multiorgan failure has been reported in the medical literature [28], and several anecdotal reports exist [29].It is important to note that in one report from New York City, 10 of 14 patients (71 percent) who were asymptomatic on admission for an obstetric indication and found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive on universal screening went on to develop symptoms during their delivery admission or postpartum [13]. Of the 14 initially asymptomatic patients, 4 remained asymptomatic, 8 developed mild symptoms, and 2 developed severe/critical disease.While the course of the infection in pregnant persons is similar to that in nonpregnant persons, there are added issues during pregnancy, such as timing of prenatal care visits and screening tests in uninfected women and, in infected women, potential pregnancy complications, timing and management of labor and delivery, and postpartum care (mother-newborn separation, breastfeeding, infant care, postpartum depression risk). These issues are reviewed below.Pregnancy complications — Although an early review of 51 pregnant patients with well-documented COVID-19 reported that 39 percent delivered before 37 weeks of gestation and 96 percent delivered by cesarean [22], a subsequent larger systematic review including 252 pregnant COVID-19 patients reported that 15 percent delivered before 37 weeks and 70 percent were delivered by cesarean [10]. It is important to emphasize that available data are generally of low quality, reflecting small numbers of cases and a disproportionate number of patients intubated with COVID-19 pneumonia. Fever and hypoxemia from severe pneumonia may increase the risks for preterm labor, prelabor rupture of membranes, and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. It appears that many of the initial third-trimester cases were electively delivered by cesarean because of a bias to intervene catalyzed by the belief that management of severe maternal respiratory disease would be improved by delivery; however, this hypothesis is unproven.The frequency of spontaneous abortion does not appear to be increased, but data on first-trimester infections are limited [10,30]. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a cell receptor, and its expression appears to be very low in the first trimester, suggesting a low risk for placental infection and subsequent miscarriage; however, severe maternal respiratory failure and hypoxemia can disrupt uteroplacental flow, leading to miscarriage from an alternate pathway [31,32].Two critically ill women had fetal deaths; one of these women died, and the other was on ECMO [27,28]. Over 95 percent of newborns have been in good condition at birth; neonatal complications have largely been related to preterm birth and to adverse uterine environments resulting from critical maternal disease [10,33].Hyperthermia, which is common in COVID-19, is a theoretical concern as elevation of maternal core temperature from a febrile illness during organogenesis in the first trimester may be associated with an increased risk of congenital anomalies, especially neural tube defects, or miscarriage; however, an increased incidence of these outcomes has not been observed. Use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, including in the first trimester, has been shown overall to be safe and may attenuate the pregnancy risks associated with fever exposure. (See ""Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management"", section on 'Fever/hyperthermia'.)Vertical transmission — Standards for neonatal evaluation at delivery of an infected mother and criteria for vertical transmission have not been developed. Assessing the immunoglobulin M (IgM) level for the virus in cord blood and sampling the neonatal nasopharynx, amnion-chorion interface, and placental tissue using aseptic technique immediately after delivery have been suggested. Amniotic fluid obtained at cesarean delivery could also be tested.Maternal viremia rates appear to be low (1 percent in one study [34]) and transient, suggesting placental seeding and vertical transmission are unlikely. To date, SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in cord blood or amniotic fluid. Few placentas have been studied, and almost all had no evidence of infection. One exception is a case report of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 who had second-trimester miscarriage in which samples taken from a placental cotyledon and submembrane were positive for SARS-CoV-2; all fetal, amniotic fluid, cord blood, and maternal blood and vaginal samples were negative [35]. In reviews including up to 51 pregnant women with COVID-19, no cases of intrauterine transmission have been documented [18,22,23]. Subsequently, several possible cases based on newborn laboratory and/or clinical findings have been reported [19,36-39], but SARS-CoV-2 testing on fetal blood, amniotic fluid, and placenta was either negative or not performed. Many of these infants were delivered by cesarean and had positive nasopharyngeal cultures for SARS-CoV-2 on days 1 or 2 of life, an elevated IgM level, and/or pneumonia. Positive IgM results are not definitive evidence of in utero infection (false positives and cross reactivity occur), and, in many of these cases, early infant infection may have been due to postnatal contact with infected parents or caregivers [40].APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS — The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered in patients with new-onset fever/chills and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea). It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Residing in or travel to a location where there is community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the past 14 days should heighten suspicion.Patients who meet the testing criteria should undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen, ideally in addition to testing for other respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus). Criteria for testing and diagnostic issues are discussed in detail separately (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'). This testing should occur in a location designed to reduce the risk of passing the infection to uninfected persons, such as at dedicated ""walk-in"" or ""drive-in"" testing locations from which results can be made readily available to the obstetric providers. A positive RT-PCR generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although occasional false-positive tests occur [41]. False-negative tests on initial testing appear to be common (approximately one in four tests [9]) and have been reported in pregnant women [42]. However, sensitivity depends on several factors: the specific RT-PCR assay, the type of specimen obtained (nasopharyngeal specimens have higher sensitivity than oropharyngeal or nasal specimens), the quality of the specimen, and the duration of illness at the time of testing [41]. If the initial nasopharyngeal test is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, the test should be repeated in 24 hours to a few days. Infection control precautions for COVID-19 should continue while repeat evaluation is being performed. Two subsequent negative samples generally rule out the infection [9]. If there is high suspicion of COVID-19 infection and diagnosis is required for management, lower respiratory tract specimens (eg, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) can be tested as they have higher sensitivity [43]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings'.)A chest radiograph is sufficient for initial evaluation of pulmonary complications in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A single chest radiograph carries a very low fetal radiation dose of 0.0005 to 0.01 mGy. Computed tomography (CT) should be performed, if indicated, as the fetal radiation dose for a routine chest CT (table 1) is also low and not associated with an increased risk of fetal anomalies or pregnancy loss. Some authorities have advocated pulmonary ultrasound, possibly at the same time as the obstetric scan, for quick diagnosis of pneumonia in pregnant women, which in certain locations would be the quickest way to ascertain high suspicion of maternal COVID-19 infection [44,45]. A detailed description of performance of lung ultrasound can be found elsewhere [44]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Evaluation' and ""Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and nursing women"".)PRENATAL CAREPreventing exposure in the community — Social distancing and hygienic measures are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.)Patients with potential exposure — Pregnant patients with an epidemiologic history of contact with a person with confirmed, probable, or suspected COVID-19 should self-isolate and be monitored for symptoms. The incubation period is up to 14 days. Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on test availability. If testing is performed, those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic can discontinue isolation seven days after the date of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 test [11]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Managing asymptomatic individuals with potential exposure'.)Further evaluation and management of patients who become symptomatic depend on illness severity, underlying comorbidities, and clinical status. Those with at least moderate illness are typically hospitalized. (See 'Classification of disease severity' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)Routine prenatal care in uninfected women — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine have issued guidance regarding prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic (available at acog.org and SMFM.org) [46,47]. It includes general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19, algorithms, and suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits. These modifications, which should be tailored for low- versus high-risk patients (eg, multiple gestation, hypertension, diabetes), include telehealth, reducing the number of in-person visits, timing of visits, grouping tests (eg, aneuploidy, diabetes, infection screening) to minimize maternal contact with others, restricting visitors during visits and tests, timing of indicated obstetric ultrasound examinations (eg, gestational age, fetal anomaly, fetal growth, placental attachment), and timing and frequency of use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles. There are many ways to reduce the time patients, including patients with high-risk pregnancies, are in the office [48]. For example, the clinician can order a 75 gram two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) instead of a glucose challenge test and 100 gram three-hour GTT (in women with positive results); cell-free DNA screening can be used (at >10 weeks) for Down syndrome screening rather than the combined test (ie, nuchal translucency on ultrasound and serum analytes). Ideally, every woman should have telehealth capabilities and a means for measuring blood pressure at home. In the author's practice, during the pandemic, most low-risk pregnant women come to the office only for in-person prenatal visits at approximately 12, 20, 28, and 36 weeks of gestation (ie, at gestational ages when ultrasound and/or laboratory tests can also be performed) to minimize person-to-person contacts. Some practices are encouraging that even these visits occur by telehealth, and others include a visit at approximately 32 weeks [9]. When an outpatient office visit occurs, all patients and health care workers wear at least a surgical mask; no partner is allowed, but video communication is encouraged.The psychological impact of COVID-19 should also be recognized and support offered. In one study, approximately one-third of respondents reported moderate to severe anxiety [49].Medical management of pregnant women with COVID-19Home care — Most pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19 have mild disease (no shortness of breath) that does not warrant hospital-level care in the absence of obstetric problems (eg, preterm labor). Patient instructions and other aspects of home care are similar to that in nonpregnant persons, except pregnant women in the third trimester should perform fetal kick counts and report decreased fetal movement [9]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting' and ""Decreased fetal movement: Diagnosis, evaluation, and management"".) The US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its approval for use of noninvasive fetal and maternal monitoring devices in the home in patients who require fetal and/or maternal monitoring for conditions unrelated to COVID-19 [50]. This can help reduce patient and health care provider contact and potential exposure to COVID-19 during the pandemic.Hospitalized patients — Pregnant women with mild disease plus comorbidities or moderate to critical disease are hospitalized. Pregnant hospitalized patients with severe disease, an oxygen requirement plus comorbidities, or critical disease should be cared for by a multispecialty team [9]. (See 'Classification of disease severity' above.)Guidelines for management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, including evaluation and care of critically ill patients, are reviewed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Additional issues in pregnant women include:●Fetal monitoring – A specific management issue in pregnant patients is fetal monitoring in those who are at a viable gestational age. The need for and frequency of fetal testing depend upon gestational age, stability of maternal vital signs, other maternal comorbidities, and discussions with the patient and her family that consider the possibly increased risks of stillbirth and perinatal morbidities in the absence of testing. For hospitalized patients, a Bluetooth-enabled external fetal monitor can transmit the fetal heart rate tracing to the obstetric provider. The monitor can be used continuously in unstable hospitalized patients in whom emergency cesarean delivery would be performed for a persistent nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. An abnormal tracing might also help guide maternal oxygen therapy. In patients with stable oxygen saturation (SaO2), a nonstress test can be performed once or twice daily, as one option. ●Monitoring for preterm labor – Monitoring pregnant patients for signs and symptoms of preterm labor is a routine component of obstetric care and should be a component of maternal monitoring of pregnant patients hospitalized in nonobstetric settings. (See ""Preterm labor: Clinical findings, diagnostic evaluation, and initial treatment"".)●Maternal oxygenation level – Among critically ill COVID-19 patients, profound acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the dominant finding. General supportive care of the critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is similar to that in patients with ARDS due to other causes. Common complications of COVID-19-related ARDS include acute kidney injury, elevated liver enzymes, and cardiac injury (eg, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death). During pregnancy, maternal peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) should be maintained at ≥95 percent, which is in excess of the oxygen delivery needs of the mother. If SpO2 falls below 95 percent, an arterial blood gas is obtained to measure the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): Maternal PaO2 greater than 70 mmHg is desirable to maintain a favorable oxygen diffusion gradient from the maternal to the fetal side of the placenta.In the intensive care unit (ICU), severely ill patients with COVID-19 are often managed in the prone position. Some ICUs have extended this approach to pregnant women, although even a semi-prone position can be a difficult position in which to place a pregnant woman in the last half of pregnancy. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"" and ""Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period"", section on 'Supportive care' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●Use and type of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis – Direct data on thromboembolic risk with COVID-19 are limited but suggest an increased risk. The American Society of Hematology, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, and the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis [51-53] recommend routine pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 unless there is a contraindication (eg, bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia). We initiate prophylaxis in all pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital for management of an antepartum obstetric or medical disorder and all postpartum women with the infection. For antepartum prophylaxis in women who are not severely or critically ill and who may deliver within a few days, unfractionated heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 12 hours is a reasonable dose. Dosing in other inpatient clinical scenarios is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and 'Postpartum care' below.)Unfractionated heparin is generally preferred in pregnant women who might be proximate to delivery because it is more readily reversed than low molecular weight heparin. Low molecular weight heparin is reasonable in women unlikely to be delivered within several days and those who are postpartum. Dosing is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)●Safety of antiviral drug therapy – Several agents are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Although some of these agents are clinically available for other indications (eg, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine), their use for COVID-19 remains investigational. At some hospitals, pregnant women with severe COVID-19 are being offered remdesivir in a compassionate-use protocol.•Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [54] and related coronaviruses (including severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) both in vitro and in animal studies [55]. It has been used without reported fetal toxicity in some pregnant women with Ebola and Marburg virus disease [56] and is being used to treat, on a compassionate-use basis, pregnant patients with severe COVID-19. Randomized trials of the drug during the COVID-19 pandemic have excluded pregnant and breastfeeding women.•Both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, but data from early randomized trials generally suggest no benefit. Hydroxychloroquine crosses the placenta. Accumulation in fetal ocular tissues has been observed in animal studies, but fetal ocular toxicity has not been observed in humans, which is reassuring given that the drug has been widely used by pregnant women for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus or for prevention of malaria. Adverse maternal effects include abnormal heart rhythms (QT interval prolongation and ventricular tachycardia). (See ""Malaria in pregnancy: Prevention and treatment"", section on 'Safety of antimalarials in pregnancy' and ""Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus"", section on 'Medications'.)Several other drugs are being used in research studies. One such drug is lopinavir-ritonavir, which is primarily used for treatment of HIV infection, including during pregnancy. It crosses the placenta and may increase the risk for preterm delivery, but an increased risk of teratogenic effects has not been observed in humans. Investigational drugs for COVID-19 that are known to be teratogenic include ribavirin and baricitinib. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications●Antenatal betamethasone – For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because they have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with MERS-CoV infection. However, the CDC have not addressed use of antenatal glucocorticoids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from preterm birth in pregnant COVID-19-positive patients.Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at high risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 [57]. However, for pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation and at risk of preterm birth within seven days, the benefits to the neonate are less clear, and ACOG has advised not administering a course of betamethasone to such patients. However, these decisions may need to be individualized, weighing the neonatal benefits with the risks of potential harm to the pregnant patient. (See ""Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery"", section on 'Gestational age at administration'.)●Low-dose aspirin – For pregnant women without COVID-19, ACOG has stated that low-dose aspirin should continue to be offered as medically indicated (eg, prevention of preeclampsia) [58]. For those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for whom low-dose aspirin would be indicated, the decision to continue the drug should be individualized. For example, continuing preeclampsia prophylaxis is likely not worthwhile in severely or critically ill patients or near term. A panel from the National Institutes of Health has stated that persons with COVID-19 who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for a comorbid condition should continue therapy as previously directed by their health care provider [11].Concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [59,60]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients when clinically indicated [61,62]. ●Tocolysis – In women with known or suspected COVID-19, our preferred tocolytic is nifedipine. It is a suitable alterative to indomethacin, which is subject to the concerns discussed above, and to beta sympathomimetics, which can further increase the maternal heart rate. Follow-up of women who recover from COVID-19 — Development of fetal growth restriction is a theoretic concern and has been described with other SARS infections [63,64]. In the absence of robust data, authorities have suggested that pregnant women with confirmed infection should be monitored with serial ultrasound assessments of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume [65] beginning 14 days after symptom resolution [66]. For those with first- or early second-trimester infection, a detailed fetal morphology scan at 18 to 23 weeks of gestation is also indicated. Very limited COVID-19-specific data on fetal growth are available [17]. Suboptimal fetal growth due to placental insufficiency is plausible because maternal COVID-19 has been associated with focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels in the chorionic plate and stem villi [67]. These lesions could be caused by COVID-19-related coagulopathy or placental hypoxia during the acute maternal illness, or both. Timing delivery in infected women — For most women with preterm COVID-19 and nonsevere illness who have no medical/obstetric indications for prompt delivery, delivery is not indicated and ideally will occur sometime after a negative testing result is obtained or isolation status is lifted, thereby minimizing the risk of postnatal transmission to the neonate [68].In women with severe illness, there are multiple issues to consider, and timing of delivery needs to be individualized [9,69]. Whether the mother's respiratory disease will be improved by delivery and the risk of postnatal transmission in the delivery room when maternal symptoms are acute are both unclear. It should also be noted that maternal antibody production and, in turn, passive newborn immunity may not have had time to develop. On the other hand, increased oxygen consumption and reduced functional residual capacity, which are normal in pregnancy, may facilitate maternal deterioration in patients with pneumonia [70]. Excessive uterine distension from multiple gestation or severe polyhydramnios in the third trimester may further compromise pulmonary function.For the hospitalized patient with COVID-19 with pneumonia but not intubated, some authorities have advocated consideration of delivery in pregnancies >32 to 34 weeks. The rationale is that delivery is performed before the pulmonary situation worsens and ongoing maternal hypoxemia places the fetus at risk of compromise. Most authorities do not advocate delivery prior to 32 weeks, even though the maternal situation may worsen in the second week, given the known morbidity and mortality of very preterm infants.Timing of delivery of the hospitalized pregnant woman intubated and critically ill with COVID-19 is challenging. After 32 to 34 weeks, some have advocated delivery if the patient is stable, but this could exacerbate the maternal condition. Between viability and <32 weeks, continuing maternal support with fetal monitoring is usually suggested for perinatal benefit as long as the maternal situation remains stable or improving. In some situations, maternal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be necessary [71]. MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND DELIVERY — Although many asymptomatic patients are concerned about leaving their home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) continues to recommend following existing evidence-based guidance regarding home birth [58]. (See ""Planned home birth"".)Infection control precautions●Prehospital notification of possible infection – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that pregnant patients who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 notify the obstetric unit before arrival so that the facility can make appropriate infection control preparations [72]. The obstetric unit should ensure that their infection control practices for these patients are consistent with CDC guidelines. ●Evaluation of all patients presenting to the hospital – All patients should be screened for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as whether they have had close contact with a confirmed case or persons under investigation, before entering the hospital for admission to the labor and delivery unit [73]. Screening can include checking temperature and asking about fever and/or new cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle aches, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, and smell and taste abnormalities. The CDC advise prioritizing the testing of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 at admission or who develop symptoms of COVID-19 during admission [72]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)Asymptomatic patients and presymptomatic patients may present to the labor and delivery unit, which has implications for the health care staff and management of the newborn. For this reason, testing all patients upon presentation may be appropriate. The author's hospital and others in areas with a high rate of infection have begun using a rapid SARS-CoV-2 test on all patients admitted to the labor and delivery unit [20]. We believe this information is useful to inform infection control precautions both intrapartum and postpartum, including newborn care [13,74,75]. During the New York City pandemic, 215 pregnant women admitted to two New York City hospitals for delivery were screened for COVID-19, and 33 (15 percent) were SARS-CoV-2-positive [20]. Of the 33 women, 4 were symptomatic and 29 were asymptomatic; thus, 13.5 percent of asymptomatic patients admitted for delivery tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the asymptomatic women who tested positive, 3/29 developed a postpartum fever, and at least one of these patients was presumed to have COVID-19. One additional patient who tested negative on admission became symptomatic postpartum, and repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing was positive.The evaluation and diagnosis of women admitted to labor and delivery with suspected COVID-19 are similar to that of other patients admitted to the hospital with suspected disease. The CDC advise prioritizing the testing of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 at admission or who develop symptoms of COVID-19 during admission [72]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)●Use of personal protective equipment on labor and delivery – The author and others recommend that all clinicians with person-to-person contact wear a surgical mask in the health care setting, under the assumption that every patient and health care colleague might be infected with COVID-19 [75]. During active labor in particular, there are concerns of viral dissemination when the patient is forcefully exhaling [76]. To address asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, we also suggest that all asymptomatic patients wear a cloth face covering, at a minimum, consistent with CDC guidance [73]. If a patient arrives to the health care facility without a cloth face covering, a face mask should be used if supplies are available.●Care of COVID-19-positive inpatients – Ideally, pregnant COVID-19 inpatients should be cared for in specially equipped (eg, negative-pressure) rooms in antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum COVID-19-only units, similar to other adult COVID-19 inpatients who are usually placed in dedicated COVID-19-only units, halls, or hospitals. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are normally instructed to wear a face mask, including during labor and delivery, which may be difficult during active pushing [76]. Infection control precautions regarding pregnant patients with confirmed or suspected infection are similar to those for other hospitalized patients and are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●Support persons on labor and delivery – Perhaps the most controversial issue regarding infection control for women in labor and delivery units is whether to allow a support person. Most facilities recognize that a support person is important to many laboring women and permit one support person who must remain with the laboring woman (may not leave her room and then return). The support person should be screened for fever and other symptoms before entering the building and in accordance with hospital policies. Those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. If screening is negative, we require that the support person wear a cloth face covering, at a minimum, consistent with CDC guidance [73]. If the support person arrives at the health care facility without a cloth face covering, a face mask should be issued if supplies are available.A support person who screens positive should not be permitted in the hospital. In such cases and when additional support persons are desired, they can be a part of the patient's labor and delivery via video. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)Route of delivery — COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery [15,46]. Cesarean delivery is performed for standard obstetric indications. Even if vertical transmission is confirmed as additional data are reported, this would not be an indication for cesarean delivery since it would increase maternal risk and would be unlikely to improve newborn outcome. Reports of COVID-19 infection in the neonate have generally described mild disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)Screening patients scheduled for induction or cesarean delivery — Patients should be screened for COVID-19 and can undergo pre-induction/pre-cesarean laboratory testing the day before a planned induction or cesarean delivery. We evaluate symptomatic patients to determine whether it is feasible to reschedule until results of COVID-19 testing are available. This requires balancing the risks of continuing the pregnancy in the setting of a positive or negative test result. In particular, if the result is positive, the patient may become more severely ill over time since symptoms are often more severe in the second week of the illness.In asymptomatic women, inductions of labor and cesarean deliveries with appropriate medical indications should not be postponed or rescheduled; this includes 39-week inductions or cesarean deliveries after patient counseling. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications'.)Analgesia and anesthesia — In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, neuraxial anesthetic is not contraindicated and has several advantages in laboring patients: it provides good analgesia and thus reduces cardiopulmonary stress from pain and anxiety and, in turn, the chance of viral dissemination, and it is available in case an emergency cesarean is required, thus obviating the need for general anesthesia. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology suggests considering suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in these patients because of insufficient data about cleaning, filtering, and potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems [77]. They also urge consideration of limiting use of intravenous, patient-controlled analgesia because of the risk of respiratory depression. General anesthesia (intubation and extubation) is considered an aerosolizing procedure, so special personal protective equipment (ie, N-95 masks, etc) should be worn by all involved health care providers during such a cesarean delivery. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)Magnesium sulfate — In women with respiratory compromise, the use of magnesium sulfate for maternal seizure prophylaxis and/or neonatal neuroprotection should be decided on a case-by-case basis since the drug may further depress respirations. Consultation with maternal-fetal medicine and pulmonary/critical care specialists is advised.Labor management — Generally, management of labor is not altered in women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic or in women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 that is asymptomatic or mild [76]. Person-to-person contact and time in the labor unit and hospital should be limited, as safely feasible. For patients who require cervical ripening, outpatient mechanical ripening with a balloon catheter is an option. For inpatient cervical ripening, using two methods (eg, mechanical and misoprostol or mechanical and oxytocin) decreases the time from induction to delivery, compared with using one agent only. (See ""Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction"", section on 'Outpatient cervical ripening' and ""Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction"", section on 'Balloon catheter combined with prostaglandins'.)Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended in women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Intake and output of fluids should be carefully monitored in these women, and aggressive hydration should be avoided since it can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen maternal oxygenation that may already be compromised [70]. In nonpregnant patients with severe COVID-19, conservative fluid management is recommended, as long as hypotension and organ hypoperfusion can be avoided. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Fluid management'.)SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in vaginal secretions or amniotic fluid, so rupture of fetal membranes and internal fetal heart rate monitoring may be performed for usual indications, but data are limited [18]. It should be noted that labor, and particularly pushing, often causes loss of feces, which can contain the virus and spread the infection [34,78].We believe that use of interventions that can increase risk of infection and have not been proven beneficial, for example the use of the birth ball or peanut ball, should be limited. As intrapartum oxygen has no proven fetal benefit, the practice of oxygen therapy for fetal resuscitation should be abandoned; the nasal cannula and face mask used are in contact with the maternal respiratory tract and secretions, so handling of such equipment increases contamination/exposure between patient and provider. Lastly, we advocate not delaying pushing in the second stage, although others have suggested minimizing the duration of active pushing because deep breathing and maternal expulsive efforts may increase exposure to the patient's respiratory secretions [70]. (See ""Intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings: Management"", section on 'In utero resuscitation' and ""Nonpharmacologic approaches to management of labor pain"", section on 'Birth ball' and ""Management of normal labor and delivery"", section on 'Pushing position and technique'.)Delivery procedures — For women with known or suspected infection, ACOG has stated that delayed umbilical cord clamping is highly unlikely to increase the risk of transmitting pathogens from an infected mother to the fetus [46]; however, many institutions have chosen to prohibit this practice in term infants, in whom the benefits are modest, to minimize newborn exposure to any virus in the immediate environment and reduce the chances that the newborn will require phototherapy for jaundice. Many institutions also prohibit skin-to-skin contact in these cases [79], although the World Health Organization has not advised against this [15]. One expert group suggested leaving the vernix caseosa in place for 24 hours after birth since it contains antimicrobial peptides [80], whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics advised bathing newborns as soon as reasonably possible after birth to remove virus potentially present on skin surfaces [81].Umbilical cord blood banking can be performed if planned; the risk of COVID-19 transmission by blood products has not been documented and is unclear at present [46].Procedures for testing for vertical transmission are described above. (See 'Vertical transmission' above.)Intrapartum and postpartum fever — COVID-19 infection should be part of the differential diagnosis of intrapartum and postpartum fever, particularly when accompanied by respiratory symptoms and reduced oxygenation. Such patients should be tested for the virus, along with evaluation for common causes of intrapartum and postpartum infection (eg, chorioamnionitis, endometritis) [13]. (See ""Intrapartum fever"" and ""Postpartum endometritis"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)POSTPARTUM CAREVenous thromboembolism prophylaxis — Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be considered in all postpartum women with COVID-19, with the decision based on individual risk assessment. For example, we would not administer pharmacologic prophylaxis to women who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and have an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and go home within a few hours.For women who receive postpartum anticoagulation, the optimum dose and duration of therapy are unclear. A prophylactic dose (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once every 24 hours) is generally used in patients who are not severely or critically ill. Some authorities recommend discontinuing prophylaxis upon discharge, and others continue prophylaxis for up to 10 to 14 days [9,70]. Patients at high risk of VTE receive a longer course (eg, six to seven weeks), which depends on the indication(s) for prophylaxis. These issues are discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)Maternal monitoring●For patients with known or suspected COVID-19 who are asymptomatic, postpartum maternal monitoring is routine. ●For patients with mild illness (see 'Classification of disease severity' above), we check vital signs and monitor intake and output every 4 hours for 24 hours after vaginal delivery and 48 hours after cesarean delivery. ●For patients with moderate illness, we perform continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for the first 24 hours or until improvement in signs and symptoms, whichever takes longer. The type and frequency of follow-up laboratory studies and chest imaging (initial or repeat) are guided by the patient's course. Several institutional protocols are available. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)●For patients with severe or critical illness, very close maternal monitoring and care on the labor and delivery unit or intensive care unit are indicated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Infant evaluation — The infants of mothers with COVID-19 are considered COVID-19 suspects, and they should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 [72]. Where testing capacity is available, neonates should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as possible and within the first 24 hours of age using available molecular assays [81]. Repeat testing should be performed at approximately 48 hours of age if the infant is still at the birth facility. Both the throat and nasopharynx should be sampled, but one swab may be used to conserve swabs and polymerase chain reaction testing reagents. A separate rectal swab can be obtained if such testing is available at their center. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)Mother-baby contact — Temporary separation of mothers with known or suspected COVID-19 from their newborns has been proposed to reduce the risk of mother-baby transmission, but may also have adverse consequences [82]. For example, not rooming-in and avoiding skin-to-skin contact can be stressful for mothers; disrupt breastfeeding; and have negative effects on newborn stress, feeding, and bonding.The World Health Organization (WHO) has opined that mothers who have suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 virus infection should be enabled to remain together and practice skin-to-skin contact [15]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise determining whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant on a case-by-case basis, using shared decision making between the mother and the clinical team [72]. Factors to consider include:●The mother's and infant's clinical conditions.●Whether the mother's infection is suspected (no SARS-CoV-2 test result) or confirmed, and the infant's SARS-CoV-2 testing result (separation is not necessary if the infant has a positive test).●The mother's desire to breastfeed.●The facility's ability to accommodate mother-baby separation or colocation.●The mother's ability to maintain separation when she goes home, if she has not met criteria to discontinue temporary separation.●Other risks and benefits of temporary separation of a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant.If mother-baby separation is implemented, the following should be considered:●Infant COVID-19 suspects should be isolated from other healthy infants and cared for according to the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.●If another healthy family member is providing infant care (eg, diapering, bathing, feeding), they should use appropriate personal protective equipment (healthy family members should wear a gown, gloves, face mask, and eye protection).If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, other measures may be utilized to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission and include:●Physical barriers (eg, a curtain between the mother and newborn) can be constructed, and the newborn can be kept ≥6 feet away from the mother.●The mother can wear a face mask and practice hand hygiene when in close contact with her infant, particularly when feeding.●If another healthy adult is in the room, they can care for the newborn.After hospital discharge — After hospital discharge [81,83]:●A mother with symptomatic COVID-19 infection should maintain a distance of at least six feet from the newborn and use a face mask and hand hygiene for newborn care until (1) at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications plus improvement in respiratory symptoms [cough, shortness of breath]) and (2) at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.●For mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have never been symptomatic, transmission precautions can be discontinued when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test [83].These are symptom- and time-based strategies for discontinuing transmission precautions. Test-based strategies also exist and are discussed in detail separately. A disadvantage of test-based strategies is that a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction result reflects presence of viral RNA but does not necessarily mean that viable virus is present and can be transmitted [41]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk of transmission' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Breastfeeding and formula feeding — It is unknown whether the virus can be transmitted through breast milk because available data are limited to very small case series. All samples of breast milk from 26 infected women tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 [10]. In another series of 13 infected women, one of the three samples of breast milk that were tested was positive by viral nucleic acid testing [84]. More data are needed to assess any potential risk of viral transmission from ingesting breast milk.There is general consensus that breastfeeding should be encouraged because of its many maternal and infant benefits. In the setting of maternal COVID-19 infection, the infant may receive passive antibody protection from the virus since breast milk is a source of antibodies and other anti-infective factors. (See ""Infant benefits of breastfeeding"" and ""Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding"".)If mother and baby separation has been implemented, ideally, the infant is fed expressed breast milk by another healthy caregiver until the mother has recovered or has been proven uninfected, provided that the other caregiver is healthy and follows hygiene precautions [72]. Expressing breast milk is important to support establishment of the maternal milk supply.Before pumping, ideally with a dedicated breast pump, the mother should wear a mask and thoroughly clean her hands and breasts with soap and water and clean pump parts, bottles, and artificial nipples [85]. The CDC have issued guidance about cleaning breast pumps and breastfeeding. If possible, the pumping equipment should be thoroughly cleaned by a healthy person. If feeding by a healthy caregiver is not possible, mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or symptomatic mothers with suspected COVID-19 should take precautions to prevent transmission to the infant during breastfeeding (wear a mask, hand and breast hygiene, disinfect shared surfaces that the symptomatic mother has contacted). However, it should be noted that the value of precautions, such as cleansing the breast prior to breastfeeding/milk expression or disinfecting external surfaces of milk collection devices (eg, bottles, milk bags) for reducing potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2, has not been formally studied [86].Ideally, women who choose to formula feed should have another healthy caregiver feed the infant. If this is not possible or desired, such women must also take appropriate infection control precautions, as described above, to prevent transmission through close contact when feeding.Analgesia — Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for treatment of postpartum pain. As discussed above, concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs in patients with COVID-19 was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [59,60]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and WHO do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs when clinically indicated [61,62]. Given the uncertainty, we suggest using acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Permanent and reversible contraception — Permanent contraception (tubal sterilization) does not add significant additional time or risk when performed at an uncomplicated cesarean birth and thus should be performed if planned. Permanent contraception after a vaginal birth is more of an elective procedure, so such decisions should be made on a local level, based upon available resources. If not performed or if a reversible contraceptive method is desired, an alternative form of contraception should be provided (eg, immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) as long as the patient desires one of these methods. This avoids additional outpatient postpartum visits. (See ""Overview of female permanent contraception"" and ""Postpartum permanent contraception: Procedures"" and ""Postpartum contraception: Counseling and methods"".)Discharge from hospital — We suggest early discharge postpartum, such as one day after vaginal delivery and a maximum of two days after cesarean delivery, to limit the patient's personal risk in the hospital environment [76].Candidates for mother-infant separation after discharge and criteria for discontinuation of separation are discussed above. (See 'After hospital discharge' above.)Postpartum office visit — Modifying or reducing postpartum outpatient care is appropriate to reduce the risk of inadvertent exposure. For example, it may be possible to perform early postpartum assessments, including wound and blood pressure checks, with telehealth. A comprehensive postpartum visit may still be important by 12 weeks, especially in patients with comorbidities and in patients who lose insurance coverage at that time.All postpartum patients should still be screened for postpartum depression four to eight weeks after delivery. The most widely used instrument is the self-report, 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (figure 1A-B), which can be completed in less than five minutes [87], but alternatives are available. As discussed above, the psychological impact of COVID-19, which may include moderate to severe anxiety, should also be recognized and support offered. (See ""Postpartum unipolar major depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Assessment'.)PREGNANCY REGISTRIES — Registries are being developed to collect data of how COVID-19 affects pregnancy and newborns. For example:●Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY (PRIORITY) is the official United States registry led by the University of California, San Francisco.●International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP) is another registry led by an international group of investigators.SELECTED RESOURCES — In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued guidance regarding prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care during the COVID-19 pandemic [46,88]. This includes general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19 and suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits, obstetric ultrasound examinations, use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles, planned induction or cesarean delivery, and contact with the infant.●American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists COVID-19 information●Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine●World Health Organization●Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:•Pregnancy and Breastfeeding•Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings●International Society of Infectious Disease in Obstetrics and Gynecology Recommendations Concerning COVID-19 and Pregnancy [9].●A dedicated website (www.pregnancycovid19.com) with several helpful pregnancy-specific links and information, including information for patients.PREGNANCY REGISTRY — Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY (PRIORITY) is a nationwide United States study of pregnant or recently pregnant women who are either under investigation or who have been confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Providers and patients can send information via priority.ucsf.edu.SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Pregnant women should follow the same recommendations as nonpregnant persons for avoiding exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We suggest that pregnant health workers in the third trimester, particularly those ≥36 weeks, stop face-to-face contact with patients. (See 'Prevention' above.)●Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant women are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals. A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although false-positive and false-negative tests are possible. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)●Pregnancy does not appear to increase susceptibility to infection or worsen the clinical course, and most infected mothers recover without undergoing delivery. However, severe disease necessitating maternal intensive care unit admission and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can occur. (See 'Maternal course' above.) ●Infected women, especially those who develop pneumonia, appear to have an increased frequency of preterm birth and cesarean delivery. These complications are likely related to severe maternal illness as intrauterine infection does not appear to occur, but this is still under investigation. A few possible early newborn infections and one possible placental infection have been reported. (See 'Pregnancy complications' above and 'Vertical transmission' above.)●The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) have issued guidance regarding prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic (available at acog.org and SMFM.org), including general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19, suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal and postnatal visits and hospital discharge, and algorithms for assessment and management. These modifications are tailored for low- versus high-risk pregnancies. (See 'Prenatal care' above and 'Discharge from hospital' above and 'Postpartum office visit' above.)●For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because of the potential for adverse effects on the course of the disease. Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. (See 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications' above.)●For most women with preterm COVID-19 and nonsevere illness who have no medical/obstetric indications for prompt delivery, delivery is not indicated and ideally will occur sometime after a negative testing result is obtained or isolation status is lifted, thereby minimizing the risk of postnatal transmission to the neonate. Severely ill patients at least 32 to 34 weeks of gestation with COVID-19 pneumonia may benefit from early delivery. (See 'Timing delivery in infected women' above.)●Screening all patients being admitted to the labor unit with a rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested as a high proportion of asymptomatic patients (13.5 percent in one study) admitted for delivery tested positive, which has clinical implications for triage, staff, and newborn care. (See 'Infection control precautions' above.)●Generally, management of labor is not altered in women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic or in women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in vaginal secretions or amniotic fluid, so rupture of fetal membranes and internal fetal heart rate monitoring may be performed for usual indications, but data are limited. COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery. The partner/support person should be screened in accordance with hospital policies and those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. (See 'Management of labor and delivery' above.)●In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, neuraxial anesthetic is not contraindicated and has several advantages in laboring patients. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology suggests suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in these patients because of insufficient data about potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems. (See 'Analgesia and anesthesia' above.)●At delivery of patients with known or suspected COVID-19, some institutions have chosen to prohibit delayed cord clamping in term infants, in whom the benefits are modest, to minimize newborn exposure to any virus in the immediate environment and reduce the chances that the newborn will require phototherapy for jaundice. (See 'Delivery procedures' above.)●Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for treatment of postpartum pain; however, there are anecdotal reports of possible negative effects of NSAIDs in patients with COVID-19. Given the uncertainty, we use acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used. (See 'Analgesia and anesthesia' above.)●Infants born to mothers with known COVID-19 are COVID-19 suspects and should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See 'Infant evaluation' above.) ●Whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant is determined on a case-by-case basis. If the infant tests positive, separation is unnecessary. If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, other measures may be utilized to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission, including physical barriers and ≥6 feet separation, personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, and utilization of other healthy adults for infant care (feeding, diapering, bathing). (See 'Mother-baby contact' above.)●The virus has only been found in one sample of breast milk, but data are limited. Droplet transmission to the newborn could occur through close contact during feeding. In mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or symptomatic mothers with suspected COVID-19, to minimize direct contact, ideally, the infant is fed expressed breast milk by another caregiver until the mother has recovered or been proven uninfected, provided that the other caregiver is healthy and follows hygiene precautions. In such cases, the mother should wear a mask and thoroughly clean her hands and breasts before pumping; the pump parts, bottles, and artificial nipples should be cleaned as well. If she breastfeeds the infant directly, similar personal hygienic precautions should be taken. (See 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding' above.)●Several agents are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir is the most promising and has been used without reported fetal toxicity in some severely ill pregnant women.

ID:127488,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens [1]. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [2]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [3].Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [4,5]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)This topic will discuss aspects of COVID-19 that are specific to children. More general aspects of the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management in adults, and prevention of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses are discussed separately.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronaviruses"".)●(See ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"".)●(See ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The epidemiology of COVID-19 is discussed in detail separately. This section focuses on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in children. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Epidemiology'.) Can children get COVID-19? — Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less commonly than adults [6-10]. In a systematic literature review (from January 1 through March 18, 2020), children accounted for 1 to 5 percent of diagnosed COVID-19 cases [11].Although surveillance definitions and criteria for testing have changed over time and geographically, the proportion of cases that have occurred in children from various countries (eg, China, South Korea, Italy, and the United States) are typically within this range [9,12-15].As of April 2, 2020, among the 149,760 laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 1.7 percent were in children <18 years; approximately 70 percent of these cases were from New York City, the rest of New York state, and New Jersey [9]. Approximately 90 percent of cases were associated with household or community exposure, and 10 percent were associated with travel. In retrospective studies of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from China, the household secondary attack rate among pediatric contacts has ranged from 4 to 7 percent [16,17]. A COVID-19 outbreak among pediatric patients has been described in a pediatric dialysis center in Germany [18]. Transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)The age distribution of cases in the United States was as follows [9]:●<1 year – 15 percent●1 to 4 years – 11 percent●5 to 9 years – 15 percent●10 to 14 years – 27 percent●15 to 17 years – 32 percentAlthough infants <1 year of age accounted for 15 percent of confirmed cases, the proportion of all cases that have occurred in infants (0.27 percent) is less than the proportion of the United States population that is <1 year of age [9].Among adult patients with COVID-19 in the United States, emerging data suggest that COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minority groups, perhaps related to underlying health conditions and economic and social conditions (eg, poverty, multigenerational households, employment in essential industries, lack of paid sick leave, limited access to medical care) [19-21]. The CDC's COVID-NET provides race/ethnicity information for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in children [22].Additional information related to COVID-19 activity in the United States (eg, outpatient visits, hospitalization) is available through the CDC's COVIDView. Can SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted through breast milk or during infant feeding? — It is unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk. The only report of testing found no virus in the maternal milk of six patients [23]. However, droplet transmission could occur through close contact during feeding (breastfeeding or bottle feeding). Strategies to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during infant feeding are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)Can SARS-CoV-2 be acquired in utero? — Issues related to COVID-19 in pregnancy, including in utero transmission, are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSAre the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than adults? — The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults, but fewer children than adults with documented infection report symptoms [9,10]. COVID-19 appears to be milder in children than in adults, although severe cases have been reported [24]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?' below.)Among 2572 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children <18 years reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by April 2, 2020, the median age was 11 years (range 0 to 17 years); 57 percent of cases were in boys [9]. In case series from China, the median age of affected children was approximately 7 years (range 1 day to 18 years); boys were affected slightly more often than girls (57 to 60 percent of cases) [6,7].Fever and cough are the most common reported symptoms in children [7,9,25,26]. In the case series from the United States, complete information about symptoms was available for 291 children; 56 percent had fever, 54 percent had cough, and 13 percent has shortness of breath; 73 percent of children had at least one of these symptoms [9]. In young infants, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause fever without any other manifestations, including respiratory symptoms and signs [27].In another series of 1391 children evaluated for COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital, 171 (12 percent) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (via identification of RNA) [7]. Approximately 16 percent of children with confirmed infection were asymptomatic, 19 percent had upper respiratory infection, and 65 percent had pneumonia. Fever occurred at some point of illness in approximately 42 percent. Other common symptoms in this case series included cough (49 percent) and pharyngeal erythema (46 percent). Less common symptoms included fatigue, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, diarrhea, and vomiting. Similar clinical manifestations have been reported in smaller case series from China and Italy [25,28]. Some children presented with only gastrointestinal symptoms [6]. Additional symptoms that have been reported in adults include chills or shaking chills, myalgia, headache, and new loss of taste or smell [29]. Cutaneous findings have been reported infrequently and are not well characterized; they include maculopapular, urticarial, and vesicular eruptions and transient livedo reticularis [25,30-32]. Reddish-purple nodules on the distal digits (sometimes called ""COVID toes"") similar in appearance to pernio (chilblains) are described predominantly in children and young adults, although an association with COVID-19 has not been clearly established [30,33-36].Laboratory findings in children with confirmed infection from Wuhan were variable. Approximately one-quarter had white blood cell count <5.5 x 109/L (5500/microL) and 3.5 percent had lymphocyte count <1.2 x 109/L (1200/microL) [7]. Procalcitonin was elevated (>46 pg/mL) in 64 percent and C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated (>10 mg/L) in 20 percent. In adult patients, lymphopenia (specifically CD4+ and CD8+ t lymphocytes [37]), elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, CRP, ferritin) have been associated with increased severity or worse outcomes. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)Chest radiographs may be unremarkable or demonstrate bilateral consolidation [38,39]. In a series of 171 children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, findings on chest computed tomography included ground glass opacity in 33 percent, local patchy shadowing in 19 percent, bilateral patchy shadowing in 12 percent, and interstitial abnormalities in 1 percent [7]. Radiographic findings may be present before symptoms [40,41]. In a study of eight Italian children hospitalized with documented COVID-19, findings on lung ultrasonography included subpleural consolidations and individual or confluent B lines [42]. These findings were concordant with radiographic findings in seven of the eight patients. They are similar to findings in adult patients with COVID-19. (See ""Bedside pleural ultrasonography: Equipment, technique, and the identification of pleural effusion and pneumothorax"", section on 'B lines and lung consolidation' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Clinical features, complications, and pathology'.)Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?Frequency of severe disease in children — Although severe cases of COVID-19 in children, including fatal cases, have been reported, most children appear to have asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease and recover within one to two weeks of disease onset [6-9,28,43-50].In a series of 2135 children from China that included 728 children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease, approximately 55 percent of all cases were mild or asymptomatic, 40 percent of cases were moderate (eg, clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia without hypoxemia), 5 percent of cases were severe (eg, dyspnea, central cyanosis, hypoxemia), and <1 percent were critical (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock) [6]. Among the 376 infants <1 year of age with available information, approximately 11 percent had severe or critical disease. These findings should be interpreted with caution; many of the severe and critical cases were not laboratory confirmed and may have been caused by other respiratory infections. Potential risk factors for severe disease — Infants <1 year of age and children with certain serious underlying conditions appear to be at greater risk for severe disease [9,51]. The CDC's COVID-NET provides information about underlying medical conditions according to age [22], although robust evidence associating underlying conditions with severe illness in children is lacking [52]. Among 345 children from the United States with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and complete information about underlying conditions, 23 percent had an underlying condition. The most commonly reported underlying conditions were [9]:●Chronic pulmonary disease (including moderate to severe asthma)●Cardiovascular disease●Immunosuppression (eg, related to cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplant, high doses of glucocorticoids)Other medical conditions that may increase the risk of severe disease in children based on data from adults include [49,51,53,54]:●Chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis●Chronic liver disease (eg, chronic hepatitis)●Endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus)●Severe obesity (body mass index ≥120 percent of the 95th percentile values; (figure 1A-B)) (see ""Definition, epidemiology, and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents"")Why COVID-19 appears to be less common and severe in children than in adults is unclear. Some considerations are a less intense immune response to the virus in children versus adults; cytokine release syndrome is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infections [55,56]. Another explanation is that viral interference in the respiratory tract of young children leads to a lower viral load in children. Finally, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, which may be expressed differently in the respiratory tract of children compared to adults [6,11,57].Multisystem inflammatory syndrome — There have been reports of a rare but serious multisystem inflammatory syndrome possibly associated with COVID-19 that has clinical features similar to those of toxic shock syndrome, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and/or Kawasaki disease (eg, persistent fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypotension, myocarditis) and laboratory findings associated with increased inflammation (eg, elevated CRP, ferritin, D-dimers) [58-62]. Many, though not all, of these patients have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or serology; none have tested positive for other pathogens. (See ""Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Invasive group A streptococcal infection and toxic shock syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"", section on 'Toxic shock syndrome' and ""Kawasaki disease: Complications"", section on 'Shock' and ""Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis"".)The role of COVID-19 in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease is unclear; previous studies have reported concomitant detection of other viruses in children with Kawasaki disease, but the significance of this association is uncertain [63]. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology"", section on 'Possible etiologic factors'.)Pending additional information, children who present with clinical features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome should be promptly referred to a specialist in pediatric infectious disease, rheumatology, cardiology, and/or critical care, as necessary [60,61]. Early diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki disease (typical or atypical) is critical to preventing long-term complications (eg, coronary artery aneurysms) [64]. Children who meet criteria for Kawasaki disease should be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin, as discussed separately. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis"", section on 'Diagnosis' and ""Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis"", section on 'Initial therapy'.)More detailed guidance for the evaluation and management of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 is provided by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health [61]. Although the evaluation includes exclusion of other infectious diseases (eg, bacterial sepsis, staphylococcal or streptococcal shock syndrome, enteroviral myocarditis), the results of this evaluation should not delay prompt referral for care.How often do children with COVID-19 require hospitalization? — A minority of children with COVID-19 require hospitalization, and very few require intensive care [7,9,65]. In case series, hospitalization and intensive care admission were more common among children with underlying conditions and infants <1 year of age, although hospitalization of infants may not reflect severity of illness. (See 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?' above.)Among 2572 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children <18 years reported to the CDC by April 2, 2020, the estimated rate of hospitalization ranged from 6 to 20 percent, and the estimated rate of intensive care ranged from 0.58 to 2 percent [9]. In another series of 171 children from China with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, three children required intensive care and mechanical ventilation; all had coexisting conditions (one each with hydronephrosis, leukemia, and intussusception) [7]. By March 8, 2020, 87 percent of children had been discharged from the hospital, and one child died four weeks after admission (a 10-month old with concomitant intussusception who developed multiorgan failure). In a study from the Lombardy region of Italy, only 4 of 1591 patients (<1 percent) admitted to intensive care units with COVID-19 were younger than 20 years [65]. How should I evaluate a child with pharyngitis during the pandemic? — Given concerns SARS-CoV-2 may be spread from the upper airway of symptomatic or asymptomatic children [66], the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests avoidance of examination of the oropharynx unless it is essential [67]. When examination of the oropharynx is necessary (including obtaining oropharyngeal swabs), personal protective equipment should be worn, whether or not the child has symptoms compatible with COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)APPROACH TO DIAGNOSISWhat are the criteria for testing for COVID-19 in children? — Criteria for testing for COVID-19 vary geographically. In the United States, guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Infectious Diseases Society of America (table 1) may be adapted by state and local health departments depending upon test availability [68-70].Testing criteria suggested by the World Health Organization can be found in its technical guidance online. These are the same criteria used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Guidance for testing in other countries is discussed separately. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Outpatient testing criteria — The approach to testing varies according to test availability and other resources (eg, some communities have begun to offer COVID-19 testing to residents regardless of symptoms or previous testing).Given limited testing resources, our institutions perform targeted testing in the outpatient setting.For children who are evaluated for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (eg, fever, persistent cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea) in the emergency department or urgent care setting, we perform testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) if the child has:●An underlying condition that may increase the risk for severe disease; examples include:•An immune-compromising condition (eg, recipients of antineoplastic chemotherapy, recent hematopoietic cell transplantation, solid organ transplant recipients, primary immunodeficiency, HIV infection with CD4 count <15 percent)•Chronic cardiac disease (eg, cardiomyopathy, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, single ventricle physiology)•Chronic pulmonary disease (eg, requirement for supplemental oxygenation or noninvasive ventilation, severe persistent asthma)•Former preterm infants•Neuromuscular disease with impaired airway clearance•Poorly controlled type I diabetes mellitus•Severe obesity (body mass index ≥120 percent of the 95th percentile values; (figure 1A-B))●Known in-person exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 14 days●Presentation with severe illness (eg, new requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline, new or increased need for ventilation [invasive or noninvasive] [52])One of the authors' institutions has instituted a ""drive-thru"" assessment center for symptomatic patients (eg, fever, persistent cough) who are otherwise stable but have either:●Underlying conditions (eg, immune compromise, chronic cardiac or pulmonary disease)●Known in-person exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 14 daysThis assessment center also provides COVID-19 screening assessment before scheduled procedures (eg, cardiac catheterization, endoscopy).Inpatient testing criteria — Our institutions perform universal testing of hospitalized patients at the time of presentation, regardless of clinical symptoms or signs of COVID-19; infants born in the institution to a mother who tested negative for COVID-19 and are admitted to the nursery or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are an exception. This strategy was implemented to reduce hospital-associated transmission, given the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in children.For hospitalized children whose initial test results are negative and are scheduled for procedures (eg, endoscopy), we retest within 48 hours of the scheduled procedure.For patients with suspected nosocomial acquisition of a respiratory virus, we test for common respiratory pathogens (eg, via multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) as well as COVID-19.Laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 — Laboratory tests for COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Detection of other respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in nasopharyngeal specimens does not exclude COVID-19 [26,49,56,71-74]. In one study, 8 of 20 children positive for SARS-CoV-2 were also positive for other common respiratory pathogens [75].MANAGEMENTShould NSAIDs be avoided? — The uncertainty about the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Assessment of severity — We use the definitions of severity provided in the multicenter initial guidance on the use of antivirals for children with COVID-10 [52]:●Mild or moderate disease – No new or increased supplemental oxygen requirement●Severe disease – New requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline without new or increased need for ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive)●Critical disease – New or increased need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, sepsis, multiorgan failure, or rapidly worsening clinical trajectoryInpatient management of children with COVID-19 — Children with COVID-19 and severe or critical lower respiratory tract disease generally require hospital admission. Children with nonsevere COVID-19 may require hospital admission if they are at risk for severe disease due to underlying conditions (eg, immune compromise).Supportive care for all patients — We provide supportive care for all pediatric patients with COVID-19 as recommended by various national committees [52,76,77]. Supportive care is the mainstay of therapy for children with severe or critical COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 improve with supportive care, even those with severe disease [52,78]. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Routine supportive care measures includes:●Provision of respiratory support, including supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive); respiratory status may change suddenly after approximately one week of symptoms [79].●Provision of fluid and electrolyte support. (See ""Fluid and electrolyte therapy in newborns"" and ""Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children"" and ""Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children"".)●Provision of empiric antibiotics as indicated for community-acquired or health care-associated pneumonia; continuation of empiric antibiotics should be determined by cultures and other microbial tests and clinical condition. Bacterial coinfections appear to be infrequent [80]. (See ""Pneumonia in children: Inpatient treatment"".)●Monitoring for cytokine release syndrome by monitoring blood pressure for hypotension, oxygen saturation for worsening hypoxemia, and biomarkers. We obtain baseline C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). We monitor CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, and LDH two or three times per week or if there is concern for worsening disease. IL-6 is performed offsite; we repeat it twice per week if it is elevated at baseline or if there is concern for worsening disease.For children receiving immunosuppressive therapy, we discuss the benefits and risks of reducing immunosuppressive therapy with the prescribing specialist (eg, oncologist, transplant clinician, rheumatologist) [81]. Although the relationship between immune compromise and severe COVID-19 disease has not been well established in children, management of viral infections in immunocompromised hosts typically includes reduction of baseline immunosuppression, if reduction is possible [82,83]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Adjusting immunosuppression'.)Antiviral therapy for select patients — Given the lack of data from controlled trials supporting the efficacy of antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19 in children, we agree with recommendations from the multicenter initial guidance on the use of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 and other experts that antiviral therapy for COVID-19 should occur in the context of a clinical trial [52]. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from ClinicalTrials.gov.Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 generally should be reserved for children with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection if testing is available [52].●Potential indications – Decisions to use antiviral therapy should be individualized according to disease severity, clinical trajectory, and underlying conditions that may increase the risk for progression. Studies of the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapy have predominantly been performed in adults with severe lower respiratory tract disease [84,85]; these studies are discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Specific treatments'.)Children with COVID-19 in whom the risks of unproven antiviral therapy may be warranted include those with severe or critical disease and those with mild or moderate disease and an underlying condition that may increase the risk of severe disease.●Choice of agent/regimen•Remdesivir — When a decision is made to use antiviral therapy, we agree with the multicenter panel that remdesivir is preferred to other agents. Although data regarding the benefits of remdesivir for children with COVID-19 are lacking, it is preferred to other antiviral agents because emerging data from comparative, randomized trials and case series in adult patients suggest that it may be beneficial and appears to be well tolerated [52,86,87]. Studies of remdesivir in adult patients with COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Remdesivir'.)Remdesivir is dosed according to weight as follows: -<40 kg: 5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) loading dose on day 1, followed by 2.5 mg/kg IV every 24 hours for 5 to 10 days (5 days for those with a rapid clinical response)-≥40 kg: 200 mg IV loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV every 24 hours for 5 to 10 days (5 days for those with a rapid clinical response)Remdesivir is a prodrug of a nucleotide analog that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and has activity against coronaviruses [88-90]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for hospitalized children and adults with severe COVID-19 (ie, oxygen saturation ≤94 percent on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) [91].Reported adverse effects of remdesivir include nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations.•Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine – The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Although hydroxychloroquine is being investigated as a treatment for COVID-19, it is not licensed for this indication [92]. It is ideally used only in hospitalized patients in the context of a clinical trial [93].We agree with the multicenter panel that hydroxychloroquine (without azithromycin) is an alternative to remdesivir for children who warrant antiviral therapy who are not candidates for remdesivir or if remdesivir is unavailable [52]. Hydroxychloroquine should be avoided in children with underlying QTc abnormalities and those who require other medications with potential for serious drug interaction with hydroxychloroquine. Before initiating hydroxychloroquine, specific interactions with other medications should be checked by use of a drug interactions program, such as the Lexicomp drug interactions tool provided by UpToDate.The multicenter panel suggests either of the following regimens for hydroxychloroquine in children [52]:-13 mg/kg (maximum: 800 mg) orally, followed by 6.5 mg/kg (maximum: 400 mg) at 6, 24, and 48 hours after the initial dose (the duration can be extended for up to five days on a case-by-case basis)-6.5 mg/kg per dose (maximum: 400 mg per dose) orally twice per day on day 1, followed by 3.25 mg/kg (maximum: 200 mg/dose) orally twice per day for up to five daysHydroxychloroquine is thought to alter endosomal and lysosomal pH, inhibiting viral replication and propagation, although the exact mechanism of antiviral activity remains uncertain [94]. In the United States, the FDA has issued an emergency use authorization to allow the use of these agents in adolescents or adults hospitalized for COVID-19 when participation in clinical trials is not feasible [95].Clinical studies of hydroxychloroquine have been limited by small sample size and have included predominantly adult patients. They are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine'.)Given the uncertain efficacy and potential cardiac toxicity, we avoid chloroquine and the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 in children [96].•Lopinavir-ritonavir – We do not recommend routine use of lopinavir-ritonavir given the absence of efficacy and unfavorable pharmacodynamics [85].Adjunctive therapy — We make decisions about the use of adjunctive therapies for immune-mediated complications of COVID-19 on a case-by-case basis according to disease severity. We do not routinely use immune modulators (eg, glucocorticoids, IL-6 inhibitors [eg, tocilizumab], interferon-beta 1b, convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients) in the treatment of children with COVID-19, except in the context of a clinical trial. The benefits and risks are uncertain [97].Although there is no available data on the use of vitamin A for the treatment of COVID-10, vitamin A has long been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of measles, and its use has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality from measles-associated pneumonia [98]. Vitamin A deficiency may be associated with impairment of humoral and cell-mediated immunity, and even mild vitamin A deficiency may lead to increased morbidity from measles and other viral respiratory infections [98]. (See ""Measles: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention"", section on 'Vitamin A'.)Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from ClinicalTrials.gov. Outpatient management of children with COVID-19Telephone triage for children — The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides guidance for telephone triage of children with possible COVID-19. How should children be managed at home? — Children with documented or suspected COVID-19 and mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, pharyngitis, other respiratory symptoms) generally should be managed at home unless they have a chronic condition that increases their risk of severe disease.Management is focused on prevention of transmission to others (ie, isolation), monitoring for clinical deterioration, and supportive care. Some evidence from a report of a cluster of cases in France suggests the possibility that children may not transmit SARS-CoV-2 as efficiently as other age groups, perhaps related to viral interference [99]. The CDC and World Health Organization provide additional guidance on what to do if you (or your child) is sick [100,101]. (See 'Prevention of transmission' below.)●Monitoring for clinical deterioration – Caregivers of children who are managed at home should be counseled about symptoms of clinical deterioration, which may occur suddenly after approximately one week of symptoms and should prompt urgent re-evaluation [79]. These include [100-103]:•Severe respiratory distress, difficulty breathing (for infants: grunting, central cyanosis, inability to breastfeed)•Chest pain or pressure•Blue lips or face•Findings associated with shock (eg, cold, clammy, mottled skin; new confusion; difficulty arousing; substantially reduced urine output)●Symptomatic and supportive care – Symptomatic care for COVID-19 in the outpatient setting is similar to that for other upper respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical syndromes:•Upper respiratory tract infection (see ""The common cold in children: Management and prevention"", section on 'Symptomatic therapy') •Pharyngitis (see ""Acute pharyngitis in children and adolescents: Symptomatic treatment"", section on 'Symptomatic treatment')•Acute gastroenteritis (see ""Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Management and prevention"", section on 'Management')The management of fever in children, including indications for treatment, are discussed separately. (See ""Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management"", section on 'Management of fever'.)When can home isolation be discontinued? — The optimal duration of home isolation is uncertain. How long a person remains infectious is uncertain. The duration of viral shedding is variable; there appears to be a wide range, which may depend on severity of illness. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.)The CDC has issued recommendations on discontinuation of home isolation, which include both test-based and nontest-based strategies [104-106]. The choice of strategy depends upon the patient population (eg, immunocompromised versus nonimmunocompromised), the availability of testing supplies, and access to testing.Avoidance of unproven interventions — Hydroxychloroquine and other investigational agents should be used only under the supervision of a health care provider, as described above; misuse of nonpharmaceutical forms of the investigational agents (eg, chloroquine phosphate, which is used in home aquariums; ivermectin intended for animals) may lead to severe toxicity, including death [93,107,108]. (See 'Inpatient management of children with COVID-19' above.)PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSIONFrom infected mother to newborn — Prevention of transmission from infected mother to newborn after delivery is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Postpartum care'.)From children with documented or suspected COVID-19During cardiopulmonary resuscitation — Prevention of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires changes to algorithms for basic and standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including [109,110]: ●Donning personal protective equipment before entering the room and scene ●Limiting personnel in the patient room to four people; video monitors (if available) can be used for some roles that can be performed outside the room (eg, the ""recorder"")●Engaging the intubator who is most likely to succeed on the first pass ●Consideration of using mechanical cardiopulmonary devices for adults and adolescents if they meet weight and height criteria●Prioritizing oxygenation and ventilation strategies with lower aerosolization risk (eg, using a high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filter, if available for all ventilation) (table 2)●Intubating early with a cuffed tube, if possible●Pausing chest compressions to intubateAdditional interim guidance and updated algorithms are available from the Guidelines-Resuscitation task force of the American Heart Association, in collaboration with other specialty societies [109], and other professional societies [110]. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Hygiene and social distancing — Prevention of transmission focuses on hygiene and social distancing. This includes [100,101,111]:●Having friends or family members bring necessary items to the home (to be retrieved outside)●Having the child (and other sick family members) wear a mask if leaving the home cannot be avoided. At the time of discharge, if supplies allow, providing patients with a pair of gloves and several masks may help to prevent transmission to household contacts. In addition, for patients without access to private transportation, arranging medical transportation, if possible, is preferable to the use of public transportation or ride-sharing services to minimize exposure to the public. ●As much as possible, keeping ill family members ≥6 feet away from other people, especially family members who are ≥65 years of age or have serious medical conditionsIf such separation is not possible, have the ill family member wear a facemask when they are in the same room or vehicle as other people.●Keeping ill family members separated from pets in the household●Having family members who have fever or cough sleep in separate rooms and use separate bathrooms●Avoiding sharing items (eg, pillows, blankets, utensils, cups)Additional information about how to care for people with documented, suspected, or possible COVID-19 at home is available from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization [100,101].Disinfection — Disinfection of frequently touched surfaces is also important, as discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Environmental disinfection'.)For asymptomatic childrenShould routine health supervision appointments be rescheduled? — During the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefits of well-visits should be balanced with the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and other communicable illnesses, within the context of patient population and office environment [112-114]. When clinicians or practices are unable to provide well-child visits to all of the patients in their practice, the CDC and AAP encourage prioritization of newborn care and vaccination of children through 24 months of age [114,115]. Disruption of immunization services increases the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses [116]. Adherence to recommendations for infants born to women who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or whose HBsAg status is unknown is particularly important for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus, especially if the delivery occurs at an unplanned facility or is attended by staff who are not knowledgeable about managing infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive [117]. (See ""Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview"", section on 'Benefits of vaccines' and ""Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents"", section on 'Routine infant immunization'.)Scheduling, home visits, telemedicine, office space, and/or office locations can be used to keep well children and children who are ill or possibly ill separated (eg, scheduling well-visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon, seeing children for sick visits in a different part of the clinic, designated examination rooms, or at a different office site [or practice] than children for well-visits) [112,118-120].The AAP provides information and resources about telemedicine, including information about state-by-state payer policies.Use of cloth face masks — The CDC recommends that individuals ≥2 years of age wear a cloth face covering (eg, homemade masks or bandanas) when they are in public settings where social distancing may be difficult to achieve (eg, grocery stores, clinician offices), especially in areas with substantial community transmission [121]. Cloth masks are not recommended for children <2 years of age because of concerns about suffocation [122]. The AAP provides additional information about cloth masks for children, including tips for increasing proper wearing and use. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.)Should play dates and playgrounds be avoided? — Given the possibility of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from asymptomatic individuals (or presymptomatic individuals within the incubation period) [6,40,123-130], the CDC recommends that children not have play dates with children from other households and that when playing outside, they remain ≥6 feet from people from other households [131]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.)The CDC provides information about how to safely remain physically active at parks and recreational facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.Hand sanitizer safety — Although washing hands with soap and water, when available is preferred for hand hygiene, alcohol–based hand sanitizer is safe for use in children when the sanitizer is used according to the information on the Drug Facts label; there is no cause for concern if children eat or lick their hands after the hand sanitizer has fully dried [132]. However, because ingestion of even a small amount of liquid hand sanitizer can cause alcohol poisoning in children (including hypoglycemia), children younger than six years should be supervised when using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be kept out of the reach and sight of children [133]. (See ""Ethanol intoxication in children: Epidemiology, estimation of toxicity, and toxic effects"" and ""Ethanol intoxication in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and management"".)SPECIAL POPULATIONSChildren with asthma — Considerations related to COVID-19 in children with asthma include the safety of glucocorticoid and nebulized medications. These considerations are discussed separately. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic'.)Children with special health care needs — The AAP provides information about how to keep children with special health care needs safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.OTHER ISSUES●What type of infant formula can be substituted if the usual formula is not available? – The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) provides advice for providers and families if infant formula is not available.●What are the effects of prolonged home confinement? – Although prolonged home confinement may provide an opportunity to enhance parent-child relationships, it may adversely affect children's physical and mental health [134-143]. They may be less physically active, spend more time with electronic devices, and eat a poorer quality diet. Mental health stressors include fear of infection, boredom, and social isolation. In a survey of primary school students from Hubei province in China after being restricted to home for a mean of 35 days, the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety (approximately 20 percent for each) was greater than that in other surveys [141]. School closures associated with health emergencies have been associated with increased risk of violence and vulnerability [137,144]. Vulnerable children and adolescents (eg, those who are homeless or in foster care, have a history of maltreatment, are sexual or gender minorities) are at particular risk for violence and adverse mental health effects [142]. Adverse mental and physical health effects can be mitigated and parent-child relations enhanced through parental role-modeling of healthy behaviors, involving children in family activities, promotion of self-discipline and self-sufficiency skills, and having direct, developmentally appropriate conversations with children about the pandemic [134,139,145-147].Clinicians should consider the potential for violence and look for signs of parental stress, irritability, depression, and/or harsh responses to child behaviors during each clinical encounter [144]. They should ask about parent stress levels, methods to manage stress, social supports, and substance use. Clinicians can offer coping strategies (eg, deep breathing, calling a friend or family member), resources, and/or referrals to mental health providers to families who may benefit from these interventions. •Resources related to child care and prevention of violence during the COVID-19 pandemic include:-Child Care Aware of America-Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children-The National Child Traumatic Stress Network•Resources for talking with children about COVID-19 are available from multiple professional groups and others, including:-The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry-The AAP: Talking to children about COVID-19-Coronavirus: A book for children.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or email these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient education"" and the keyword[s] of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (See 'Introduction' above.)●Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less frequently than adults. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●COVID-19 in children is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported, including cases with clinical features similar to toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease. In case series, the most common symptoms in children are fever and cough. Other symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, diarrhea, and vomiting. Additional symptoms that have been reported in adults include chills or shaking chills, myalgia, headache, and new loss of taste or smell. Laboratory findings are often normal but may include leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and elevated procalcitonin or C-reactive protein. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)●Criteria for testing for COVID-19 vary geographically. In the United States, guidance provided by the CDC and Infectious Diseases Society of America (table 1) may be adapted by state and local health departments depending upon test availability. (See 'What are the criteria for testing for COVID-19 in children?' above.)•Given limited testing resources, our institutions perform targeted testing in the outpatient setting. For children who are evaluated for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in the emergency department or urgent care setting, we perform testing for SARS-CoV-2 if the child has an underlying condition that may increase the risk for severe disease, known in-person exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 14 days, or presentation with severe illness. (See 'Outpatient testing criteria' above.)•We perform universal testing of hospitalized patients at the time of presentation, regardless of clinical symptoms or signs of COVID-19; infants born in the institution to a mother who tested negative for COVID-19 and are admitted to the nursery or neonatal intensive care unit are an exception. (See 'Inpatient testing criteria' above.) ●Children with COVID-19 and severe or critical lower respiratory tract disease generally require hospital admission. Severe disease is defined by a new requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline without new or increased need for ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive). Critical disease is defined by new or increased need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, sepsis, multiorgan failure, or rapidly worsening clinical trajectory. (See 'Assessment of severity' above.)●Supportive care (eg, respiratory support, fluid and electrolyte support, monitoring for cytokine release syndrome) is the mainstay of therapy for children with severe or critical COVID-19. (See 'Supportive care for all patients' above.)●We agree with recommendations from the multicenter initial guidance on the use of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 and other experts that antiviral therapy for COVID-19 should occur in the context of a clinical trial. (See 'Antiviral therapy for select patients' above.)•Decisions regarding antiviral therapy should be individualized according to disease severity, clinical trajectory, and underlying conditions that may increase the risk for progression.•When a decision is made to use antiviral therapy, we prefer remdesivir to other agents. Hydroxychloroquine (without azithromycin) is an alternative for children who are not candidates for remdesivir or if remdesivir is unavailable. ●Children with documented or suspected COVID-19 and mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, pharyngitis, other respiratory symptoms) generally should be managed at home unless they have a chronic condition that increases their risk of severe disease. Management is focused on prevention of transmission to others (ie, isolation), monitoring for clinical deterioration (eg, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, symptoms of shock), and supportive care. (See 'How should children be managed at home?' above.)●Symptomatic care for COVID-19 in the outpatient setting is similar to that for other upper respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical syndromes. It is discussed separately. (See ""The common cold in children: Management and prevention"", section on 'Symptomatic therapy' and ""Acute pharyngitis in children and adolescents: Symptomatic treatment"", section on 'Symptomatic treatment' and ""Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management"", section on 'Management of fever' and ""Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Management and prevention"", section on 'Management'.)●Prevention of transmission focuses on hygiene and social distancing. The CDC and WHO provide guidance about preventing transmission of COVID-19 in the home and outpatient setting.

ID:127551,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for ""coronavirus disease 2019"" [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Society guideline links'.)This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of arrhythmias and conduction system disease in patients with COVID-19. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of other cardiac presentations (eg, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, etc) and noncardiac symptoms of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere: ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The prevalence of arrhythmias and conduction system disease (and cardiovascular disease in general) in patients with COVID-19 varies from population to population. In most available reports, the specific cause of palpitations or type of arrhythmia have not been specified. Hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities, both known to contribute to the development of acute arrhythmias, have been frequently reported in the acute phase of severe COVID-19 illness; therefore, the exact contribution of COVID-19 infection to the development of arrhythmias in asymptomatic, mildly ill, critically ill, and recovered patients is not known [4]. ●In a multinational cohort of 8910 patients from Asia, Europe, and North America, 304 patients (3.4 percent) had a history of arrhythmia [5]. A history of arrhythmias was more than twice as common in patients who died from COVID-19 (6.8 versus 3.2 percent among survivors). ●In 137 subjects from Hubei province, 10 patients (7.3 percent) noted palpitations as one of the initial symptoms [6]. ●In a study of 138 patients from Wuhan who were hospitalized with COVID-19-related pneumonia, arrhythmias were reported in 17 percent of the general cohort and in 44 percent of patients admitted to an intensive care unit [7]. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSSigns and symptoms — Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. The most common clinical features reported at the onset of illness include fever (99 percent), fatigue (70 percent), dry cough (59 percent), anorexia (40 percent), myalgias (35 percent), dyspnea (31 percent), and sputum production (27 percent) [7]. Noncardiac manifestations of COVID-19 are discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of arrhythmias or conduction system disease. Patients may be tachycardic (with or without palpitations) in the setting of other illness-related symptoms (eg, fever, shortness of breath, pain, etc). The following observations have been reported from various cohorts:●In the cohort from Hubei province, 7.3 percent reported palpitations as a presenting symptom [6,8]. ●Among 4250 patients with COVID-19 from a multicenter New York cohort, 260 (6.1 percent) had QTc >500 milliseconds at the time of admission [9]. However, in another study of 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the baseline QTc was 435 milliseconds before taking these medications [10]. ●Among 393 patients with COVID-19 from a different New York cohort, atrial arrhythmias were more common among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (17.7 versus 1.9 percent) [11].●Among 187 patients with COVID-19 from a Chinese cohort, 11 patients (5.9 percent) had ventricular tachyarrhythmias while hospitalized [12]. ●Epidemiologic data from the Lombardi region of Italy show a nearly 60 percent increase in the rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the peak of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic (when compared with the same time frame from 2019) [13]. This could be related to COVID-19 infections, stress related to the pandemic, or delays in seeking medical attention by those with cardiac symptoms. It does not appear that there was increase in shockable rhythms, even in those who were suspected of or diagnosed with COVID-19. Other patients in whom arrhythmias may be seen include:●Patients who present with other cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection, such as myocardial injury or myocardial ischemia. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".) ●Patients with hypoxia, shock (septic or cardiogenic), or evidence of widespread systemic inflammation [14]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●Patients with electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypokalemia) that predispose to the development of arrhythmias. (See ""Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults"", section on 'Cardiac arrhythmias and ECG abnormalities' and ""Hypomagnesemia: Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion"", section on 'Cardiovascular'.)●Patients who are receiving QT-prolonging therapies and who may develop polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). (See 'Patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes)' below.) ●Patients with fever, which can unmask cases of cardiac channelopathies such as Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome [15,16]. (See 'Brugada syndrome' below and ""Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations"".)Cardiovascular testingECG — Most patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected, and in particular patients with severe disease or in whom QT-prolonging medications will be used, should have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the time of entry into the health care system [17]. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single- or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring or multiple lead positions from a hand-held ECG device may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient [18]. This will allow for documenting baseline QRS-T morphology should the patient develop signs/symptoms suggestive of myocardial injury or an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the baseline ECG allows for documentation of the QT (and corrected QTc) interval. Importantly, QTc will need to be monitored if QT-prolonging therapies are initiated (eg, azithromycin, chloroquine, etc) to reduce the risk of acquired LQTS. (See ""Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"" and 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' below.)Continuous ECG monitoring — In the absence of documented cardiac arrhythmias, suspected myocardial ischemia, or other standard indications, continuous ECG monitoring is not required. However, as part of infection control mechanisms for patients with established or suspected COVID-19 infection, many hospitals are utilizing continuous ECG monitoring (in conjunction with automated blood pressure readings and oxygen saturation monitors) in lieu of standard vital sign checks by nursing staff. This practice reduces the number of clinical staff interacting with the patient, thereby reducing the risk to health care workers and preserving personal protective equipment. Transthoracic echocardiography — While some patients may develop cardiac manifestations, including myocardial injury, an initial transthoracic echocardiogram is not necessary for all patients. Providers may consider using a point-of-care ultrasound for a focused exam. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)DIAGNOSIS OF ARRHYTHMIAS — Arrhythmias are most commonly diagnosed from a combination of vital signs and review of the ECG, ideally a 12-lead ECG, but a rhythm strip can also be used. Tachycardias present with a pulse greater than 100 beats per minute, while most bradyarrhythmias present with a pulse less than 50 to 60 beats per minute. ●The most common arrhythmia overall in patients with COVID-19 is sinus tachycardia, but the most likely pathologic arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and monomorphic or polymorphic VT.●The differentiation between various tachycardias based on regularity (ie, regular or irregular) and QRS width (ie, narrow or wide QRS complex) requires only a surface ECG. (See ""Narrow QRS complex tachycardias: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to the diagnosis"".)●Bradyarrhythmias, including sinus pauses or high-grade heart block with slow escape rhythms, have not typically been seen but can be identified using a surface ECG if present. (See ""Sinus node dysfunction: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II"" and ""Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block"".)The diagnosis of acquired LQTS can be made in a patient with sufficient QT prolongation on the surface ECG in association with a medication or other clinical scenario (ie, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) known to cause QT prolongation. Ideally, the diagnosis is made following review of a full 12-lead ECG, but sometimes a single-lead rhythm strip is adequate if a full 12-lead ECG cannot be obtained. Acquired QT prolongation is typically reversible upon removal of the underlying etiology, such as discontinuation of an offending medication or correction of electrolyte derangements. (See 'Management' below.)Overall, the average QTc in healthy persons after puberty is 420±20 milliseconds. In general, the 99th percentile QTc values are 470 milliseconds in postpubertal males and 480 milliseconds in postpubertal females [19]. A QTc >500 milliseconds is considered highly abnormal for both men and women.MANAGEMENTPatients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes) — All patients with torsades de pointes (TdP) should have an immediate assessment of the symptoms, vital signs, and level of consciousness to determine if they are hemodynamically stable or unstable. Unstable patients — Patients with sustained TdP usually become hemodynamically unstable, severely symptomatic, or pulseless and should be treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms [20], including cardioversion/defibrillation (algorithm 1). Initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, with the exception of intravenous (IV) magnesium, is not indicated for hemodynamically unstable or pulseless patients. A full discussion of the standard approaches to basic life support and advanced cardiac life support is presented separately. (See ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"" and ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"".)Stable patients — Patients with TdP who are hemodynamically stable on presentation may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. As such, therapy should be promptly provided to most patients. A stable patient is one who typically shows no evidence of hemodynamic compromise but may have frequent, repetitive bursts of TdP. This patient should have continuous monitoring and frequent reevaluations due to the potential for rapid deterioration as long as the TdP persists. ●For patients with a single episode of TdP, treatment with IV magnesium along with correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements and/or removal of any inciting medications may be sufficient. The patient should be carefully monitored until electrolytes are normalized and the QT interval nearly normalizes.●For patients with multiple self-terminating episodes of TdP, the same therapies are utilized as in patients with a single episode (ie, IV magnesium, correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements, and/or removal of any inciting medications), along with additional interventions to increase the heart rate, which include overdrive pacing and/or IV isoproterenol infusion.Patients with other arrhythmias — The management of other arrhythmias in the setting of COVID-19 infection is no different from the routine management of these conditions without COVID-19 infection. Please refer to the following topics for management:Atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular tachycardias:●(See ""Overview of the acute management of tachyarrhythmias"".)●(See ""Overview of atrial fibrillation"".)●(See ""Overview of atrial flutter"".)●(See ""Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia"".)●(See ""Treatment of symptomatic arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome"".)●(See ""Focal atrial tachycardia"".) Monomorphic VT:●(See ""Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management"".)●(See ""Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: Treatment and prognosis"".)●(See ""Ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease"".) Conduction system disease:●(See ""Sinus node dysfunction: Treatment"".)●(See ""Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block"".)●(See ""Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II"".)●(See ""Temporary cardiac pacing"".)Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc) — While data are limited, many patients are being treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, which are structurally similar to quinidine and have QT-prolonging effects by blocking activation of the potassium channel IKr (hERG/Kv11.1) [4,21,22]. Other medications with QT-prolonging effects may be tried for COVID-19 (table 1). In addition, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by CYP3A4, so other medications that inhibit this cytochrome could raise plasma levels [21]. Limited data on hydroxychloroquine suggest it has a low risk of causing TdP, based on its use for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and antimalarial therapy [23,24]. There are only in-vitro data suggesting safety of azithromycin and chloroquine on action potential duration alternans [25], with no clinical data on TdP risk. For these medications, their time window of use is short duration, which is another reason the risk of TdP may be lower. However, there can be greater QT-prolonging effects in those with electrolyte abnormalities, those taking other QT-prolonging medications, those with chronic renal insufficiency, and those with congenital long QT syndrome. ●In one study of 84 patients with COVID-19 who were receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, QTc increased from 435 milliseconds to a maximum of 463 milliseconds, peaking between days 3 and 4 [10]. There was a high-risk group of nine patients (11 percent) whose baseline QTc of 447 milliseconds increased to 527 milliseconds. Importantly, no TdP was seen.●In a study of 81 severely ill patients admitted with suspicion of COVID-19 who were all treated with azithromycin and randomized to receive chloroquine at high dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) or low dose (450 mg twice daily for one day, then 450 mg daily for four days), baseline QTc (by Fridericia method) averaged 425 milliseconds and was not significantly different between high- and low-dose patients [26]. QTc increased to >500 milliseconds in 7 of 37 (18.9 percent) high-dose recipients and 4 of 36 (11.1 percent) low-dose recipients. Two high-dose chloroquine recipients developed VT, but no TdP was reported.Monitoring for QT prolongation — The patient's baseline QTc value should be obtained prior to administering any drugs with the potential to prolong the QT interval [27]. The best method to obtain the QT interval is with a 12-lead ECG, but to reduce exposure to staff, this may not always be feasible. A single-lead ECG may underestimate the QT interval, and there should be an attempt to use a multiple-lead telemetry system to monitor the QT interval. There has been some outpatient use of hydroxychloroquine also, but there is no clear guidance regarding how to monitor these patients. Ambulatory ECG monitoring technologies, including the use of mobile or wearable technologies (eg, mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry), have been reported as reliable alternatives when the demand exceeds capacity for standard telemetry monitoring [28]. It is also important for patients being treated with QT-prolonging drugs to report promptly any new symptoms including palpitations, syncope, or near-syncope. They should also report clinical changes that could lead to hypokalemia, such as gastroenteritis or the initiation of diuretic therapy. In general, patients with the following QTc intervals are at low risk for significant QT prolongation and polymorphic VT:●QTc <460 milliseconds in prepubertal males/females●QTc <470 milliseconds in postpubertal males●QTc <480 milliseconds in postpubertal femalesPatients with baseline QTc interval ≥500 milliseconds (with a QRS ≤120 milliseconds) are at increased risk for significant QT prolongation and polymorphic VT [29]. In such patients, efforts should be made to correct any contributing electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and/or hypomagnesemia), with a goal potassium of close to 5 mEq/L. Even in those with a normal QT interval, there should be a review and discontinuation of any QT-prolonging medications that may not be essential to the immediate care of the patient (eg, proton pump inhibitors, etc) (table 1) [30]. In particular, when more than one QT-prolonging agent is being used simultaneously, we recommend one of the following approaches:●One protocol has been published from the Mayo Clinic, using the same QTc cutoffs as above [31]. If two to three hours after a dose of hydroxychloroquine or other QT-prolonging agent, the QTc increases to ≥500 milliseconds or if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds, there should be a reevaluation of the risk of TdP versus benefit of the medication, and the following steps should be taken:•Recognition that there is an increased risk of TdP.•Discontinuation of all other QT-prolonging medications.•Correction of all electrolyte abnormalities.•Place the patient on continuous telemetry, with consideration of a wearable defibrillator or placement of external defibrillator patches.•If TdP develops, then hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin or other medication should be stopped.●Another protocol proposes an ECG at baseline and again at four hours after hydroxychloroquine or other antiviral medication administration only if there is congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, patients are already taking other QT-prolonging medications, or patients have structural heart disease or bradycardia [21]. Another ECG can be completed one to three days later. For most others, an ECG or other QTc interval-monitoring method can be done 24 hours after starting the medication. If the QTc increases to ≥500 milliseconds, if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds, or if ventricular ectopy develops, this protocol recommends cardiology consultation. ●There has been a risk score developed in hospitalized patients for the prediction of QT interval prolongation, though not necessarily for the use of hydroxychloroquine [32,33]. It classifies patients as low, moderate, or high risk for TdP, which may allow for triaging whether continuous telemetry is needed while using the QT-prolonging medication, especially if there are limited resources and the patient could otherwise be followed as an outpatient. Signs of toxicity — There have also been anecdotal reports of toxicity associated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Doses of 5 gm of chloroquine will usually lead to death [34]. Symptoms typically occur in the first hour after ingestion, with seizures or cardiac arrest, as these medications are similar to quinidine, a sodium channel blocker. Cardiovascular toxicities include a widened QRS, prolonged QT interval, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, and hypotension. If ingestion is acute, activated charcoal may be used. In general, treatment involves epinephrine, high-dose diazepam, and repletion of potassium [35]. However, if too much potassium is given, there can be rebound hyperkalemia when there is intracellular shifting out of the cells. A bicarbonate IV infusion may be given, but there should be care in that it may lead to worsening hypokalemia. IV lipid emulsion has also been attempted in limited reports [36]. A local poison control center may be contacted for additional help. Brugada syndrome — Because there is an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of fever in those with Brugada syndrome, aggressive fever reduction with acetaminophen is imperative. High-risk patients, such as those with a spontaneous type 1 pattern ECG and prior syncope, might consider going to an emergency department if they have fever that cannot be promptly lowered with acetaminophen [21]. (See ""Brugada syndrome: Prognosis, management, and approach to screening"", section on 'Treatment'.)PROGNOSIS — Mortality rates appear to increase significantly with increasing age; case fatality rates <1 percent have been reported for those under 50 years of age, with rates approaching 15 percent for patients 80 years of age or older [37]. Similarly, mortality increases with disease severity, as there were no deaths reported among the mild or severe cases in the Chinese cohort, but mortality approached 50 percent among critically ill patients [37]. Underlying medical comorbidities appear to significantly impact COVID-19 severity and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and hypertension have been reported to have significantly high-case fatality rates compared with patients without these underlying comorbidities (10.5 and 6 percent mortality, respectively, compared with 0.9 percent mortality without underlying comorbidities) [37,38]. Similarly, patients in a multinational cohort who died from COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to have a history of cardiac arrhythmias [5].IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PROVIDERS CARING FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS — In addition to providing the best possible care for each patient, infection control to limit transmission is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 [4,39-43].Inpatient care and consultation — The approach to caring for hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 differs slightly, with the intent to reduce exposure to (and spread of) COVID-19 to health care providers. In general, the number of persons interacting directly with the patient and the time spent in the room should be minimized. Social distancing should be maintained, with both the patient and other members of the health care team. The following steps, when possible, will minimize exposure of personnel and limit the use of PPE:●For stable new admissions, the patient should be seen in person by the attending physician and at most one house officer or advanced practitioner (when applicable).●For stable patients on daily rounds, one person on the primary care team should enter the room to conduct the needed physical exam, with the rest of the team participating from outside the room via video chat or telephone.●Routine arrhythmia consultations, particularly in stable patients with ECG evidence documenting a specific arrhythmia or conduction disorder, can be completed without entering the patient's room by reviewing the available records and ECG monitoring data. ●Consider placing all patients on telemetry with concerns of arrhythmias, thereby reducing the need for in-room vital signs.●Utilize rooms with windows in the door to assist with monitoring patients from outside of the room. Patients can be contacted by telephone for routine matters without requiring entry into the room.Arrhythmia-related procedures — In order to maximize the available health care system resources to treat COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, while also minimizing the potential exposure of health care personnel to asymptomatic carriers of the virus, elective and nonurgent procedures should be postponed until a later date. A discussion of the reasoning behind the decision to postpone any procedure should be communicated to the patient and documented in the medical record. Conversely, urgent and semiurgent procedures should be performed when the perceived benefits of the procedure to the patient outweigh the risks of resource utilization and health care personnel exposure. Examples of the types of procedures in each category are as follows [4,39]: Urgent (substantial risk of decompensation, hospitalization, or death if the procedure is delayed):●VT ablation for medically uncontrolled electrical storm in a hemodynamically compromised patient.●Catheter ablation of incessant, hemodynamically significant, severely symptomatic tachycardia (supraventricular VT [SVT]/atrial fibrillation [AF]/atrial flutter) not responding to antiarrhythmic drugs, rate control, and/or cardioversion.●Catheter ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or preexcited AF with syncope or cardiac arrest.●Lead revision for malfunction in a pacemaker-dependent patient or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patient receiving inappropriate therapy.●Generator change in pacemaker-dependent patients who are at elective replacement indicator (ERI) or at device end of life. ●Pacemaker or ICD generator change with minimal battery remaining, depending on specific clinical situations.●Secondary prevention ICD.●Pacemaker implant for complete heart block, Mobitz II atrioventricular (AV) block, or high-grade AV block with symptoms or severe symptomatic sinus node dysfunction with long pauses.●Lead/device extraction for infection, including patients not responding to antibiotics for endocarditis, bacteremia, or pocket infection.●Cardiac resynchronization therapy in the setting of severe refractory heart failure in guideline-indicated patients.●Cardioversion for highly symptomatic atrial arrhythmias or rapid ventricular rates not controlled with medications.●Transesophageal echocardiogram for patients who need urgent cardioversion.Semiurgent (those procedures not deemed urgent but should be performed in a timely manner due to the clinical scenario): ●VT ablation for medically refractory recurrent VT. ●SVT ablation in patients with medically refractory SVT, resulting in emergency department visits. ●Cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) generator replacement for ERI battery status that is not urgent. ●Primary prevention ICD in patients at particularly high risk of life-threating ventricular arrhythmia. Nonurgent (those procedures that may be delayed for weeks or months):●Premature ventricular complex ablation. ●SVT ablation. ●AF and atrial flutter ablation in stable patients without heart failure, not at significant risk of getting hospitalized by delaying the procedure, or at high risk for procedure-related complications due to comorbidities. ●Electrophysiology testing to evaluate stable tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia. ●Primary prevention ICD that is not semiurgent. ●Cardiac resynchronization therapy in stable patients.●CIED upgrade. ●Pacemaker implant for sinus node dysfunction, Mobitz I AV block, other stable non-high-degree AV block, or tachy-brady syndrome in mildly symptomatic patients. ●Pacemaker or ICD generator replacements in patients with >6 weeks of battery remaining. ●Extraction of noninfected devices/leads unless device function is dependent on lead extraction and reimplant. ●Cardioversion for stable arrhythmias with well-tolerated symptoms. ●Left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in patients who can be on anticoagulation.●Transesophageal echocardiogram for routine assessment of valves or LAA closure devices and cardioversions that can be done after appropriate period of anticoagulation.●Implantable loop recorder implants.●Tilt-table testing.Perioperative cardiac implantable electrical device management — For patients with a CIED undergoing surgery or an endoscopic procedure, it is important to know if the patient is pacemaker dependent, if the patient has an ICD with therapies activated, and the likelihood of electromagnetic interference (EMI) during the procedure (eg, due to electrocautery, etc). In a patient with documented or suspected COVID-19 who is undergoing a procedure with a high likelihood of EMI that could result in pacemaker or ICD malfunction, application of a magnet may be used to suspend antitachyarrhythmia therapy in an ICD or to produce asynchronous pacing in a pacemaker [40]. This allows the patient to safely proceed with the necessary procedure without reprogramming the CIED before and after the procedure, thereby reducing the risk to health care personnel and preserving personal protective equipment (PPE).The standard approach to CIED management, which includes in-person reprogramming of the CIED before and after the procedure, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Perioperative management of patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"".)Cardiac implantable electrical device interrogations — For most patients, the majority of CIED follow-up device interrogations on modern-era devices can be done either in person or remotely. To maintain social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend remote CIED interrogations for the vast majority of stable patients [40].Certain situations remain, however, in which an in-person CIED interrogation may be the preferred option, including [4,40]:●Suspected CIED malfunction, including:•Inappropriate pacemaker pacing or sensing noted on ECG or telemetry monitoring.•Failure of ICD to deliver therapy during documented sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia.●Clinically actionable abnormality of CIED or suspicion of the device being at or near end of battery life, noted on remote monitoring, telemetry, or ambulatory monitoring.●ICD shocks, presyncope, or syncope concerning for an arrhythmic event to perform programming changes.●Untreated sustained ventricular arrhythmias in a patient with an ICD.●Evaluation of symptoms suspicious for arrhythmia or abnormal device function in patients who are not enrolled in remote monitoring.●Identified need for reprogramming of the CIED, or ICD patients whose device is delivering auditory or vibratory alerts.●Assessment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a patient with a stroke and no clear documentation of AF on ECG or telemetry monitoring.●For CIED patients requiring urgent or emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, consider performing a computed tomography scan instead if possible (to minimize the need for additional health care provider or device manufacturer representative contact); if not urgent, delay the MRI. ●Patients in the emergency department (or other setting) where remote monitoring is not available. Remote monitoring should be used wherever possible, including the option of asking family to bring the patient's home monitoring equipment to the hospital. After in-person CIED interrogation is performed, it is important to disinfect any parts of the programmer (eg, the programming wand and cord) that have been in contact with the patient. If available, disposable plastic wand coverings may be used to minimize contamination, and consideration should also be given to using a dedicated interrogation device in all settings with known or suspected COVID-19-positive patients. To reduce exposure of health care personnel to CIED patients, a doughnut magnet can be used as an alternative to a complete CIED interrogation or reprogramming [41]. When a hospitalized patient has a pacemaker that does not have remote monitoring capabilities, and proper function of the pacemaker is in question, temporary application of a doughnut magnet over the pacemaker is safe to quickly determine whether or not the pacemaker is capable of delivering pacing stimuli that can capture the heart. Magnet application will place the pacemaker in an asynchronous pacing mode. Depending on the manufacturer and programmed settings, this may include changes in the paced rate, which gives evidence of battery status (ie, elective replacement indicator) or whether there is pacemaker capture. In addition, demonstration of ventricular capture should provide basic reassurance that the pacemaker is functional and can avoid the need for a complete pacemaker interrogation. (See ""Perioperative management of patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"".)Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) — In general, basic life support and advanced cardiac life support for patients with COVID-19 should be administered in standard fashion, similar to patients without COVID-19, with the following exceptions [4,42] (see ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"", section on 'Resuscitation of patients with COVID-19'):●Any personnel caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate PPE before entering the room: gown, gloves, eye protection, and a respirator (eg, an N95 respirator). If supply of respirators is limited, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges that facemasks are an acceptable alternative (in addition to contact precautions and eye protection), but respirators should be worn during aerosol-generating procedures, which includes intubation. The appropriate PPE should all be donned prior to interacting with the patient, even if this leads to a delay in the provision of resuscitative care.●The number of people involved in the resuscitation should be kept to a minimum. This typically includes a team leader, anesthesiologist to manage the airway (if the patient is not already intubated), recorder/scribe, and persons to perform chest compressions, defibrillation, and administration of medications (often, these participants can rotate to allow for periods of rest after performing chest compressions).●In COVID-19 patients who are not yet intubated at the time of cardiac arrest, early intubation should be performed by the provider most likely to achieve success on the first pass, utilizing all readily available technology (eg, video laryngoscopy) to optimize first-pass success. Chest compression can be stopped during intubation, and intubation (with a cuffed endotracheal tube) can be performed prior to the standard two minutes of chest compressions and early defibrillation as a means of controlling the potential spread of airborne droplets.●If available, mechanical chest compression device may be used in place of manual compressions for adults and adolescents who meet minimum height and weight requirements.●For a critically ill patient who is already intubated and in the prone position at the time of arrest, CPR may be attempted with the patient prone by performing compressions with the hands over the T7/10 vertebral bodies. Defibrillation may be performed with the pads in the anterior-posterior position. The patient should be turned to the supine position for resuscitation only if able to do so without equipment disconnections that may lead to aerosolization of viral particles.●For out-of-hospital resuscitation efforts, lay rescuers should perform chest compression-only CPR while wearing a face mask or cloth covering. When available, an automated external defibrillator should be applied and used according to the usual protocol. (See ""Automated external defibrillators"" and ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"", section on 'Defibrillation'.)Initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, with the exception of IV magnesium, is not indicated for hemodynamically unstable or pulseless patients. A full discussion of the standard approaches to basic life support and advanced cardiac life support is presented separately. (See ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"" and ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of arrhythmias or conduction system disease. However, patients in whom arrhythmias may be seen include patients with myocardial injury, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, shock, electrolyte disturbances, or those receiving medications known to prolong the QT interval. (See 'Signs and symptoms' above.)●All patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected should have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the time of entry into the health care system. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single-lead or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient. Continuous ECG monitoring and echocardiography are not required in all patients but can be used in select situations. (See 'Cardiovascular testing' above.)●Patients with sustained torsades de pointes (TdP) usually become hemodynamically unstable, severely symptomatic, or pulseless and should be treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms, including cardioversion/defibrillation (algorithm 1). Patients with TdP who are hemodynamically stable on presentation may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. Treatment with intravenous (IV) magnesium along with correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements and/or removal of any inciting medications may be sufficient, although patients with frequent recurrent episodes may require additional interventions. (See 'Patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes)' above.)●Patients receiving QT-prolonging medications should have a baseline QTc value obtained prior to administering the drugs. If the QTc subsequently increases to ≥500 milliseconds or if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds from the baseline ECG, the risk versus benefit of continued treatment with the QT-prolonging medication should be reassessed, with consideration of dose adjustment or additional intervention. (See 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' above.)●The approach to caring for hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 differs slightly, with the intent to reduce exposure to (and spread of) COVID-19 to health care providers. In general, the number of persons interacting directly with the patient and the time spent in the room should be minimized. Social distancing should be maintained, with both the patient and other members of the health care team. (See 'Inpatient care and consultation' above and 'Arrhythmia-related procedures' above.)●The approaches to cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) interrogations and perioperative CIED management are summarized in the text. Strategies to avoid in-person device interrogations should be deployed. (See 'Cardiac implantable electrical device interrogations' above and 'Perioperative cardiac implantable electrical device management' above.)●In general, basic life support and advanced cardiac life support for patients with COVID-19 should be administered in standard fashion as for patients without COVID-19. However, any personnel caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (including gown, gloves, eye protection, and a respirator or face mask) before entering the room, the number of people involved in the resuscitation should be kept to a minimum, and early intubation should be performed for patients who are not yet intubated at the time of cardiac arrest.

ID:127556,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic, in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread. The WHO has indicated three priorities for countries [2]:●Protecting health workers●Engaging communities to protect those at highest risk of severe disease (eg, older adults and those with medical comorbidities)●Supporting vulnerable countries in containing infectionThe rapidly expanding COVID-19 acute respiratory pandemic has impacted all areas of daily life, including medical care. The primary intervention to slow disease spread has been physical distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene, and staying home as much as possible. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.) Delivering care for patients with cancer during this crisis is challenging given the competing risks of death from cancer versus death or serious complications from SARS-CoV-2, and the likely higher lethality of COVID-19 in immunocompromised hosts [3,4]. Many patients with cancer are struggling to receive treatment for their cancers due to hospitals canceling or delaying surgeries and other procedures, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. There is also concern that patients who are otherwise healthy and have curable cancers that require timely implementation of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation have unfortunately concluded that the risk of contracting COVID-19 may outweigh the benefits of cancer treatment [5]. Inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers, limited hospital capacity, including intensive care units (ICUs), and lack of point-of-care testing and seroprevalence data further complicate the difficulty. This topic will discuss issues related to balancing the risk from treatment delay versus harm from COVID-19, ways to minimize the compromise of physical distancing during care delivery, how limited healthcare resources can be appropriately and fairly allocated, and reviews the recommendations for cancer care during the COVID-19 epidemic from expert groups [6-12].Issues pertaining to the coronavirus in the general population are discussed elsewhere, as are issues related to particular patient populations.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Pregnant and breastfeeding women'.)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE IN CANCER PATIENTS — The prevalence of cancer in those with COVID-19 has varied across reports.Although limited, the best information on incidence of COVID-19 among patients with cancer comes from Wuhan, China [3]. Of the 1524 patients with cancer admitted to an oncology department over a six-week period from December 2019 to February 2020, 0.79 percent (12 patients) had infection with SARS-CoV-2. Although this infection rate was higher than the cumulative incidence in the community served by the hospital (0.37 percent), these patients were all sick enough to be admitted, and this report does not address the incidence of COVID-19 among community-dwelling outpatients with cancer.Other studies, also from Wuhan, China, suggest that among those with COVID-19, approximately 1 to 2 percent have cancer [13-16]. On the other hand, a higher prevalence of cancer in those with COVID-19 have been reported from the New York City area (in one report of 5700 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 6 percent had cancer [17]), and in Lombardy, Italy (8 percent of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU] for COVID-19 had either active or prior history of malignancy [18]). In another report, 20 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in all of Italy were in patients with active cancer [19]. As the infection becomes more widespread, the population concurrently challenged by cancer and COVID-19 will undoubtedly expand asymmetrically across different geographies and risk cohorts. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Impact of age'.)CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND OUTCOMES — As in non-cancer populations, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with cancer usually include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, rigors, and a loss of taste or smell (table 1). Reddish-purple nodules on the distal digits similar in appearance to pernio (chilblains) have also been described, mainly in children and young adults with documented or suspected COVID-19 (""COVID-toes""). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)Although COVID-19 is typically more severe and lethal among older people [20], people of any age with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk if they contract the virus [21]. These conditions include active or past history of cancer, particularly if they recently received or are continuing to receive treatment. However, data are extremely limited and more studies are needed.Data on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients are limited by small sample sizes. One is a report of 28 patients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in Wuhan, China [22]:●Regarding demographics, 67 percent were male, the median age was 65 years, and the most frequent cancer type (7 of 28, 25 percent) was lung cancer. Eight were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission.●Clinical characteristics included fever in 82 percent, dry cough in 81 percent, and dyspnea in 50 percent. Lymphopenia was present in 82 percent and 75 percent were anemic.●In terms of clinical course, more than one-half of the patients had severe disease (15 of 28, 54 percent), and six required admission to the ICU (21 percent). There were more severe events among the seven patients who had received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy within the last 14 days, relative to those who had not received treatment with the last 14 days (hazard ratio [HR] 4.079, 95% CI 1.086-15.322). The finding of patchy consolidation on admission computed tomography (CT) was also associated with a greater risk of severe disease (HR 5.438, 95% CI 1.498-19.748).●At the time of analysis, the outcome was fatal in 8 patients (29 percent); 10 had been discharged, and 10 remained in hospital.Is illness more severe in patients with malignancy? — Accumulating data suggest that the likelihood of a severe illness from COVID-19 is higher among patients with cancer, particularly those with hematologic malignancies and lung cancer. ●Much of the early data were derived from patients treated in Wuhan, China:•An early prospective cohort study from China included approximately 1600 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory disease; 18 patients had cancer [23]. Among these 18 patients, there was a higher risk of severe events (defined as death or being admitted to the ICU requiring invasive ventilation) compared with patients without cancer (39 versus 8 percent). However, these 18 patients represented a heterogeneous group and were not an ideal representation of the entire population of patients with cancer [24].•A meta-analysis of four retrospective studies totaling 1356 COVID-infected patients, all treated in China, addressed the severity of complications from the disease in patients with malignancy [25-29]. Although patients with cancer accounted for a higher proportion of individuals with severe disease (3.9 versus 1.4 percent of those with non-severe disease, odds ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.00-5.23), there were only 33 cancer patients in all four studies, and the number of events overall was very low.•Additional information comes from an analysis of 105 patients with cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 in 14 hospitals in Wuhan, China, over a seven-week period, whose outcomes were compared with a control group of 536 patients without cancer, and matched for age, hospital, and hospitalization time [30]. Lung cancer was the most frequent malignancy (n = 22), followed by gastrointestinal (n = 13), breast (n = 11), or thyroid cancer (n = 11), and hematological malignancy (n = 9). Compared with the matched controls without cancer, patients with cancer had higher observed death rates (odds ratio [OR] 2.34, 95% CI 1.15-4.77), higher rates of ICU admission (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.59-5.08), a greater likelihood of severe symptoms (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.74-4.41), and a two-fold higher likelihood of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Notably, cancer patients also experienced more in-hospital infections (19 versus 1.5 percent) and were more likely to be smokers (34 versus 9 percent), which could have accounted for some of these differences. Patients with hematologic malignancies, lung cancer, and metastatic cancer had the highest frequency of severe events, but the number of patients in each category was small. ●Data are emerging in other populations. Two analyses of patients treated for COVID-19 in New York City contribute to the evidence base regarding the severity of illness in cancer patients:•An analysis of 5688 patients diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 over a five-week period in a single New York City health system included 334 patients with cancer (6 percent); most had breast (n = 57) or prostate cancer (n = 56), followed by lung (n = 23), urothelial (n = 18) and colorectal cancer (n = 16) [31]. After adjusting for age, cancer patients aged 66 to 80 were intubated significantly more frequently than those without a diagnosis of cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.76, 95% CI 1.15-2.70); no significant difference was found in other age groups. Although cancer patients under age 50 had a fivefold higher mortality rate than those in this age group without cancer (RR 5.01, 95% CI 1.55-16.2), mortality rates from COVID-19 were not significantly higher in older patients with cancer compared with those without cancer.•A higher case-fatality ratio (CFR) for patients with COVID-19 and a cancer diagnosis was seen in a second report from a different New York City Hospital system [32]. Over a three-week period, 218 COVID-19-positive patients with a diagnosis of malignancy were identified, and 61 died, with a CFR of 37 percent for hematologic malignancies, and 25 percent for solid tumors, which included 6 deaths in 11 with lung cancer (CFR 55 percent). When compared with an age- and sex-matched cohort of 1090 patients with COVID-19 infection but without cancer from the same hospital system and same time period, the CFR for cancer patients was double that of noncancer patients (28 versus 14 percent). In multivariate analysis, the higher mortality rate in cancer patients was associated with older age, multiple comorbidities (heart and chronic lung disease, but not diabetes or chronic kidney disease), need for ICU support, and elevated levels of D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase, and lactate. Few patients were on active oncologic therapy, and the impact of specific treatments, including immunotherapy, could not be assessed.The particularly high mortality rates among lung cancer patients is discussed in more detail below. (See 'Patients with lung cancer' below.)WHICH CANCER PATIENTS SHOULD GET SARS-COV-2 TESTING?Patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure — Cancer can be an immunocompromised state, and many cancer treatments can further compromise the immune system. As such, cancer patients with fever or lower respiratory findings (eg, cough, dyspnea, hypoxia) are among the highest priority for COVID-19 testing. Subsequent approach, depending on the results of SARS-CoV2 testing, is discussed below. (See 'Approach to those who have had SARS-CoV-2 testing' below.)These patients should also be evaluated for alternative causes of their symptoms other than COVID-19, such as influenza, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary progression of their underlying cancer (eg, lymphangitic spread), or treatment-related side effects such as postsurgical or systemic therapy related pulmonary events (eg, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonitis, pulmonary edema/fluid overload, immunotherapy-related pneumonitis, etc). Other symptoms (eg, chills, muscle pain, sore throat) also raise the suspicion for COVID-19 and may warrant testing. (See 'Differentiating lymphangitic spread, pneumonitis, and COVID-19' below and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing' and ""Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy"" and ""Radiation-induced lung injury"".)We also recommend COVID-19 testing for cancer patients with an exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Particular considerations for testing of lung cancer patients are discussed below. (See 'Patients with lung cancer' below.)Should those receiving immunosuppressive therapy be tested? — For patients with cancer without symptoms of COVID-19, guidance regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing is evolving, and the approach among UpToDate experts is variable. Some institutions are routinely testing all cancer patients 48 to 72 hours prior to immunosuppressive therapies and prior to medical procedures. This policy is supported by updated guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America, which now recommends SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in asymptomatic individuals before immunosuppressive procedures, regardless of a known exposure to COVID-19 [33]. According to these guidelines, immunosuppressive procedures are defined as cytotoxic chemotherapy, solid organ or stem cell transplantation, long acting biologic therapy, cellular immunotherapy, or high-dose corticosteroids.Other institutions follow a selective approach to testing, based upon the individual clinician's judgment as to the immunosuppressive potential of the specific regimen (eg, testing would be preferred prior to highly immunosuppressive treatments such as methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin plus cisplatin [MVAC], or cisplatin/etoposide; but not for less myelosuppressive regimens such as gemcitabine or docetaxel monotherapy, or single agent immunotherapy). Specific considerations for patients with lung cancer are discussed below. (See 'Patients with lung cancer' below.)However, test availability is still limited in many jurisdictions, and there is limited consensus regarding which patients should be tested, and how often. Local and state public health directives and guidance on who should be tested and the logistics for carrying out testing should be followed.The approach depending on SARS-CoV-2 test results is discussed below. (See 'Approach to those who have had SARS-CoV-2 testing' below.) APPROACH TO THOSE WHO HAVE HAD SARS-COV-2 TESTINGPositive test for SARS-CoV-2 infectionHolding immunosuppressives and COVID-19 management considerations●In general, immunosuppressive cancer therapy should be withheld in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.•However, although data are very limited, a case report has suggested that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib for patients with a chronic hematologic malignancy may be a possible exception [34], and continuation of this class of drugs should be considered on a case-by-case basis [35]. •For patients receiving glucocorticoids for management of their cancer or toxicities of treatment, our approach depends on the indication, but data are absent in this area. For example, if patients are on high-dose steroids and tapering is acceptable, we would do so. However, we recognize that for certain indications, for example steroids for severe immune-related adverse events or edema from central nervous systems, discontinuation of glucocorticoids is not possible.For patients who are receiving glucocorticoids, the decision as to whether to continue or discontinue in a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 must be individualized, and depends in part on the dose and indication for the glucocorticoid. As an example, decision-making for high-dose glucocorticoids in a patient with brain metastases or epidural spinal cord compression, or a serious immunotherapy-related adverse event is more difficult, and must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.●Additionally, some oral non-immunosuppressive therapies such as hormonal therapies or drugs targeting activating mutations (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] inhibitors or BRAF/MEK inhibitors) may be continued on a case-by-case basis.Regarding management of COVID-19, many mild cases (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea or hypoxia) and asymptomatic infections can be managed conservatively at home, if individuals can be adequately isolated. However, patients with more severe disease may warrant a higher level of care. Importantly, if a cancer patient with late-stage disease or with significant comorbid health conditions affecting the heart or lungs acquires severe COVID-19 and requires mechanical ventilation, the prognosis is likely to be dismal [36]. It is therefore imperative for clinicians to have proactive discussions with patients about goals of care and advance care planning, especially for those with advanced cancer [37]. Depending on state regulations, patients should be offered the option of completing a Physician Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form and/or other type of out-of-hospital do not resuscitate (DNR) order, especially if they would not want to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or mechanical ventilation. In the absence of an advance directive, a patient with underlying severe chronic illness and acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 who is getting worse despite maximal therapy may be appropriate for a unilateral DNR order to reduce the risk of medically futile CPR to patients, families, and health care workers. This may occur through informed consent with the patient or his/her surrogate, or occasionally, informed assent [37]. Consultation with a palliative care specialist may be beneficial, although access to essential palliative care services may be limited in the face of high demand in all countries during the pandemic [38,39].Management of COVID-19 is discussed in further detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)When can cancer treatment be safely restarted? — While there are no universally accepted guidelines as to when cancer therapies can be safely restarted after COVID-19 diagnosis, given that reinfection rates and their consequences are unknown, the effects of further suppressing or augmenting a patient's immune system quickly after COVID-19 must be weighed heavily against the risks of their unique tumor's biology. ●Our approach for most patients, which draws upon available guidelines and individual centers' ""best practices,"" is to hold immunosuppressives until symptoms from COVID-19 have resolved. Once symptoms have resolved, we retest for SARS-CoV-2 and proceed with planned cancer therapies only if a negative result is obtained. However, given a significant false negative rate in first-generation test kits, two consecutive negative tests ≥24 hours apart can be considered.However, clinical judgment and individualized decision-making is needed, particularly in settings in which curative therapies are being withheld. As an example, in advanced testicular cancer, delaying chemotherapy for any extended period of time is usually not appropriate, and the risk/benefit ratio would favor continuing treatment even if the patients had persistent viral shedding but felt clinically well. Serological assays to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are being developed and are discussed below. Once validated and widely available, such assays can be used to identify patients with previous exposure and possible immunity.Examples of approaches taken by expert groups and at other institutions are as follows:●For cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, ASCO recommends that immunosuppressive cancer treatments be held until symptoms are resolved (including resolution of fever without the use of antipyretics) and there is some certainty that the virus is no longer present (eg, a negative SARS-CoV-2 test), a position that is generally concordant with United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) test-based strategies for discontinuing home isolation, as well as guidelines for returning to work for health care workers who have recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection or have had an exposure. These are discussed elsewhere. ●However, the CDC guidelines are more stringent than ASCO in one respect, calling for negative results of a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected ≥24 hours apart. An exception to this general recommendation would be if the cancer is rapidly progressing and the risk/benefit assessment favors proceeding with cancer treatment.Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that to be released from home isolation, the patient must test negative using two samples collected at least 24 hours apart; where testing is not possible, confirmed patients should remain isolated for an additional two weeks after symptoms resolve. ●However, the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published rapid guidance on the delivery of anticancer therapy that suggests treatment may be initiated or resumed after only one negative SARS-CoV-2 test. Similar guidelines are followed at some institutions in the United States. However, given a significant false negative rate in first-generation test kits, two consecutive negative tests may be considered.  ●At some institutions, sending patients who have been cleared to resume treatment to an isolated infusion center, away from the main infusion center, may be recommended. This position stems from concerns as to the limitations of test strategies, and that some proportion of recovered patients who initially test negative might in fact be persistent virus shedders [40].Regardless of the timing of reinitiation of treatment, physical distancing rules and contact limitation remain essential components of cancer treatments amid the pandemic to protect the patient, the health care workers, and other non-COVID-19 patients being treated in the same center.Management of persistent virus shedding — In general, patients with persistent viral shedding despite symptom resolution should stay on precautions/isolation until they convert to a negative test. However, decisions must be individualized, carefully weighing the risks and benefits of withholding versus restarting treatment.There appears to be a wide range in the duration of viral shedding, which may depend on severity of illness. However, an important point is that detecting viral RNA via a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. There may be a threshold of viral RNA level below which infectivity is unlikely. For example, according to CDC, among those who continue to have detectable RNA, concentrations of detectable RNA three days following recovery are generally in the range at which replication-competent virus cannot be reliably isolated; additionally, isolation of infectious virus from upper respiratory specimens more than nine days after illness onset has not yet been documented [41]. Nevertheless, there is no way to distinguish patients who remain infectious from those who do not, and therefore decisions regarding reinitiation of cancer treatments must be individualized, particularly if the withheld treatments are potentially curative, and the period of persistent viral shedding is prolonged.Negative test for SARS-CoV-2 infection — In such patients, the approach depends on whether the patient is symptomatic, and if so, the cause for the respiratory symptoms and the cancer in question. For those in whom respiratory symptoms are mild, following an approach that is similar to those without respiratory symptoms may be appropriate. (See 'General considerations regarding cancer management' below and 'Cancer type-specific guidance' below.)However, travel history, recent contacts, and prevailing local public health conditions should be considered given the imperfect negative predictive value of current COVID-19 testing, which is discussed in detail elsewhere. Retesting may be needed if the index of suspicion is high. For those with more severe symptoms, management will depend on the underlying etiology and goals of care. Careful consideration for non-COVID-19 and potentially cancer and/or treatment-related etiologies causing similar constellations of symptoms must always be considered.Role of serologic testing — Serologic tests detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood. Those that have been adequately validated may help identify patients who have had COVID-19 or exposure to SARS-CoV-2. However, there are many unknown factors, including sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value [42]; how much immunity is conferred by a prior infection, and for how long; and the level and types of antibodies that indicate immunity. Additionally, while serologic tests may be able to identify some patients with current infection (particularly those who present late in the course of illness), it is less likely that antibodies will be reactive in the first several days to weeks of infection, and therefore serologic tests offer little utility for diagnosis in the acute setting. This subject is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Serology to identify prior infection'.)GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING CANCER MANAGEMENT — Delivering cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis is challenging given the competing risks of death from cancer versus death or serious complications from infection, and the likely higher lethality of COVID-19 in immunocompromised hosts, including those with cancer. Other challenges include cancellations of in-office visits; delays in routine cancer screening [43]; surgery postponements or cancellations; physical distancing in the office, clinic, and infusion rooms; and the transition to telemedicine for many visits. (See 'Minimizing the compromise of physical distancing during cancer care delivery' below.)There is no ""one size fits all"" approach to delivering cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and no international guidelines. Treatment decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. Relevant issues are expanded upon in the following sections. Conceptual frameworks for balancing cancer risk versus infection risk, and practical approaches for managing cancer patients during the pandemic are presented below. (See 'Conceptual framework for balancing competing risks' below.) General care — The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) suggests the following guidance for general care from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as described in the links below:●General Health Care Facility and Health Care Professional guidance●Clinical care guidance ●Home care guidance ●High-risk subpopulation guidanceIn addition to general guidance provided by the CDC, the following points have been emphasized in the ASCO recommendations:●Patients should be informed regarding the symptoms of COVID-19, and trained in proper handwashing, hygiene, and minimizing exposure to sick contacts and large crowds.●At this time, no specific evidence or guidance on mask use for patients with cancer has been published. Patients and clinicians are urged to follow the CDC's general recommendations on mask wear, which now recommends that everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they go out in public, as well as guidance from local health authorities.There is no guidance or evidence to suggest that N95 masks are required for cancer patients. However, most institutions and clinical practices are requiring health care workers, patients, and visitors to wear a surgical face mask within the facility. (See 'Allocation of limited health care resources' below.)●In general, as recommended by the CDC, any clinic visits that can be postponed without risk to the patient should be postponed. This includes routine surveillance visits to detect cancer recurrence. In many cases, the recommended frequency of these visits is already considered a range (eg, three to six months), so extending the time between evaluations may still be within the recommendations. (See 'Minimizing the compromise of physical distancing during cancer care delivery' below.)●For cancer patients with fever or other symptoms of infection, a comprehensive evaluation should be performed, as per usual medical practice. (See 'Patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)●Prescreening via telephone calls or digital platforms for COVID-19 symptoms and exposure history prior to planned in-person clinic visits is recommended, if possible [44]. Screening clinics should be developed to allow for patients with symptoms to be evaluated and tested in a dedicated unit with dedicated staff.Further information is available within UpToDate on the evaluation, diagnosis, and screening for COVID-19 that are not specific to cancer patients. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)Cancer diagnosis and staging — In general, as recommended by the CDC, any clinic visits that can be postponed without risk to the patient should be postponed. As an example, this might include a patient who is clinically suspected of disease with a low risk of rapid progression (eg, minor suspicious findings on mammography). There is no evidence that COVID-19 infection interferes with or has an effect on the diagnosis and staging of cancer. In a patient newly diagnosed with cancer, it is reasonable to limit staging procedures and pretreatment evaluation only to those that are most necessary to inform development of the initial care plan.Cancer surgery●Delaying elective surgeries – The CDC's guidance for health care facilities and guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that ""elective surgeries"" at inpatient facilities should be rescheduled, if possible. However, clinicians and patients need to make individual determinations, based on the potential harms of delaying needed cancer-related surgery; in many cases these surgeries cannot be considered ""elective."" The American College of Surgeons notes that cases that involve cancers that may progress without treatment should be performed as resources permit, to minimize the need for emergency procedures, which are often more complicated and more likely to consume limited resources. Also, if a surgery will likely require postoperative intensive care, the capacity of available intensive care units (ICUs) should be considered as part of decision-making. (See 'Should those receiving immunosuppressive therapy be tested?' above.)In some cases, neoadjuvant therapy may be used as a means of delaying surgery. As an example, patients with rectal cancer may undergo chemoradiotherapy plus upfront chemotherapy (total neoadjuvant therapy) rather than chemoradiotherapy alone as a means of delaying surgery. (See ""Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma"", section on 'Total neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors'.)In other situations where neoadjuvant hormonal therapy is not routinely considered (eg, early stage breast cancer, high-risk prostate cancer), it may be reasonable to offer neoadjuvant therapy or to simply delay surgery rather than proceeding to upfront surgery. The risks of tumor progression with delay in definitive surgery should be weighed against the potential added burden on hospital resources, case complexity, and the risk of exposure to COVID-19. However, neoadjuvant therapy that requires clinic visits, clinician-patient contact, or that is immunosuppressive must also be viewed with the potential incremental risks to the patient.Specific guidance for decision-making for cancer surgery on a disease-by-disease basis is available from the American College of Surgeons, from the Society for Surgical Oncology, from an international Urologic Oncology Group, and from the European Society of Surgical Oncology. ●When should elective surgeries be resumed? – As health care facilities consider resuming elective surgical cases, the American College of Surgeons and other groups have issued the following recommendations [45,46]: •SARS-CoV-2 infection rates should be on a downward trend for at least two weeks at the facility's geographic location•Resource utilization, including ICU bed and personal protective equipment (PPE), must be carefully calibrated•Testing of patients and employees must be strongly considered•Prioritization and scheduling of cases must be managed carefully by all key stakeholders.Other resources for resuming cases are available [47,48].Radiation therapy — Some patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) with curative intent or for rapidly progressive tumors may reasonably proceed with therapy, as the risks of delaying treatment may outweigh the risks of COVID-19 exposure and infection. Where available, alternative regimens should be offered. As an example, an international expert consensus statement has recommended that neoadjuvant short course RT be preferred over long-course chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer during the pandemic [49]. (See ""Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma"", section on 'Short-course radiotherapy'.) For those receiving RT for symptom control, or for whom an alteration of schedule is unlikely to significantly impact outcome, treatment should be delayed or adjusted. According to the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), if hypofractionated schedules are considered reasonable, they should be considered. Similarly, the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group has issued guidance on alternative radiation treatment schemes in blood cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [50].For patients who are actively undergoing RT with established treatment plans, the decision to continue requires careful consideration of indications, dose already delivered, and risks and benefits. ASTRO suggests that cancellation or delay in cancer treatment may be an appropriate option for patients with COVID-19, after a reassessment of the patient's goals of care. Recommendations are also available from an international Radiation Oncology Group called the Global Radiation Oncology Targeted Response. NICE has published a rapid guideline on the delivery of radiation in cancer patients.Systemic anticancer treatments — There is no direct evidence to support changing or withholding chemotherapy or immunotherapy in patients with cancer [51], and routinely withholding critical anticancer or potentially immunosuppressive therapy is not recommended for those who do not have COVID-19. The approach to patients who have a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 is discussed above. (See 'Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection' above.)The balance of potential harms that may result from delaying or interrupting treatment versus the potential benefits of possibly preventing or delaying COVID-19 infection is very uncertain. ASCO recommends that clinical decisions be individualized, and consider factors such as the curability of the cancer, the risk of cancer recurrence with treatment delay, modification or interruption; the number of cycles of therapy already completed; and the patient's tolerance of treatment. NICE has published a rapid guideline on delivery of systemic anticancer treatments.●Chemotherapy – Administration of chemotherapy is determined on a case-by-case basis. The decision is influenced by the likelihood of cure or extension of life from the cancer treatments, the potential risks of delaying treatment, the patient's tolerance of treatment, where they are in the planned treatment course, the local incidence of coronavirus and availability of necessary resources, and whether testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been performed. (See 'Should those receiving immunosuppressive therapy be tested?' above.)In general, adjuvant therapy with curative intent should likely proceed, despite the threat of SARS CoV-2 infection during therapy. Shorter treatment duration should be considered, where feasible. (See ""Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer"", section on 'Duration of therapy'.)For patients receiving palliative therapy for metastatic disease, the decision to continue requires careful consideration of indications, response to treatment already delivered, and risks and benefits of continued treatment. In some cases, treatment delays may lead to worsening symptoms and performance status and the loss of the opportunity to treat [36]. Considerations should include how such delays require hospital admission for palliation of symptoms, which would further stress available resources. Shared decision-making is paramount.Considerations for chemotherapy treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic set forth by ASCO include the following:•For patients in deep remission who are receiving maintenance therapy, stopping chemotherapy may be an option. Similarly, for those in whom the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is expected to be small and where non-immunosuppressive therapies are available (eg, hormone therapy for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer or prostate cancer), it may be reasonable to omit chemotherapy in consideration of the risks of COVID-19.•Oral chemotherapy and home infusion of chemotherapy drugs (if logistically feasible) may be options for some, but require coordination with the oncology team to ensure that patients are taking their treatments correctly. •If a particular cancer center is heavily affected by coronavirus infections, it may be reasonable to alter the chemotherapy schedule so that fewer visits are needed or to arrange infusion at a less affected cancer center.Specific guidance for treatment of hematologic malignancies on a disease-by-disease basis is available from the American Society of Hematology. The use of prophylactic growth factors is discussed below. (See 'Supportive care' below.)●Immunotherapy – At this time, there are no data regarding whether checkpoint inhibitor therapy increases, decreases, or has no effect on the severity of coronavirus infection and the immune response to it. Of particular concern is treatment-related pneumonitis, which may increase the risk of serious complications if the patient develops COVID-19. For those with a known coronavirus exposure, it is recommended to hold treatment until it is clear that the patient will not develop COVID-19. (See 'Patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)Updated guidelines from ASCO suggest that the potential harms and benefit of therapy with these agents should be carefully considered for each patient. The role of SARS-CoV-2 testing for patients initiating immunotherapy is discussed above. (See 'Should those receiving immunosuppressive therapy be tested?' above.)Less frequent drug administration is an option for patients who are already receiving the drug. One modeling study suggested that pembrolizumab 400 mg every six weeks leads to similar exposures as every three week administration of a single dose of either 200 mg or 2 mg/kg [52]. The safety and efficacy of this extended dosing option has been shown in patients with advanced melanoma [53], and this is an appropriate option for some patients receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy, particularly in areas where the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is high. Both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have approved a new dosing regimen of 400 mg every six weeks for pembrolizumab across all currently approved adult indications, in addition to the current 200 mg every three week dosing regimen [54,55].Decisions regarding whether it is appropriate to use combination versus single agent immunotherapy will need to be individualized. The risks of immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) associated with ipilimumab-containing combination regimens (or other immunotherapy combinations), including the risks of hospitalization and associated COVID-19 exposure, should be weighed against the diminished efficacy of single agent therapy, in each particular setting. Other considerations are similar as to those receiving chemotherapy. (See ""Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy"".)●Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation – Although there are limited data regarding the impact of COVID-19 in transplant candidates and donors and cellular therapy recipients, there is sufficient concern that COVID-19 could have a significant impact on posttransplant or post-therapy outcomes. Decisions on whether hematopoietic cell transplantation should be delayed must be individualized.The American Society of Hematology has published a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that pertain to treating hematologic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which address the role of induction and consolidation therapies, including hematopoietic cell transplantation in many malignancies. In addition, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance have provided guidance on stem cell transplantation and COVID-19 that may be of value.Considerations from ASCO include the following:•It may be prudent to test potential donors for COVID-19 even in an absence of evidence of transmission by blood transfusion.•As a general precaution, visitation post-transplant may need to be limited and visitors may need to be screened for symptoms and potential exposure.Supportive care — ASCO has set forth the following recommendations:●Although myeloid growth factor support is typically administered for those at high risk for febrile neutropenia (>20 percent), it may be reasonable for patients with a lower level of expected risk for febrile neutropenia with treatment (eg, >10 percent) to be prescribed prophylaxis with growth factor support.●There is no known role for prophylactic antiviral therapy for COVID-19 in any patient, including immune suppressed patients.●For patients who are febrile and likely to be neutropenic based on the timing of their cancer treatments, it may be reasonable to prescribe empiric antibiotics if the patient seems stable by clinical assessment (in person or via telemedicine evaluation). It is preferable that further evaluation be pursued, if necessary, outside of the emergency department.●Flushing of ports can occur at intervals as long as every 12 weeks, and patients who are capable of flushing their own devices should be encouraged to do so. However, the process of training may itself be a source of exposure and access to sterile supplies at home may be limited. (See 'Managing subcutaneous ports' below.)●Transfusions should be given according to usual practice guidelines, if possible, with consideration of erythropoietin-stimulating agents if severe or life-threatening anemia is anticipated or if blood products become scarce due to lack of donations. If anemia is due to bleeding, tumor embolization, volume expanders, and antifibrinolytic agents (eg, epsilon aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid, where available) can be offered as a temporizing measure; iron infusions are another option for those in less immediate need. In the operating room, the use of cell saver may also be appropriate.For patients in need of other blood products such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or platelets, care should be individualized based on the indications, severity, and alternatives. Donor-directed transfusions should be encouraged from patient family members in order to help sustain blood product supply during the pandemic.●Glucocorticoids are widely used in cancer patients, for example, for chemotherapy- or radiation-induced nausea and vomiting; infusion-related reactions; management of edema in patients with brain metastases or epidural spinal cord compression; and in conjunction with hormone therapies such as abiraterone, to reduce the likelihood of treatment-related mineralocorticoid deficiency. Although data are limited regarding the impact of glucocorticoids on host immunity to COVID-19 in patients with cancer [51], we do not routinely discontinue glucocorticoids, if they are indicated, in cancer patients who do not have suspected or documented COVID-19. Discussion on the approach to cancer patients with COVID-19 is found above. (See 'Holding immunosuppressives and COVID-19 management considerations' above.)Select indications for glucocorticoids in cancer are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults"" and ""Infusion-related reactions to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used for cancer therapy"" and ""Management of vasogenic edema in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors"" and ""Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression"", section on 'Symptomatic and preventive care'.)Advance care planning — Proactive advance care planning is important for all cancer patients, but is particularly critical given the additional risk of COVID-19. Aligning the care that is delivered with the patient's values and goals of care in the setting of an acute life-threatening illness is important, especially for patients with chronic, life-limiting disease. Individuals who are most likely to develop severe illness will be older and have a greater burden of chronic illness; these are the very populations who may wish to forego prolonged life support, should the need arise. If an oncology patient with late-stage disease or with significant comorbid health conditions affecting the heart or lungs develops COVID-19 and requires mechanical ventilation, the prognosis is likely to be dismal [36]. (See 'Patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)Because of these issues, it is imperative for clinicians to have proactive discussions with patients about advance care planning, especially for those with advanced cancer [37]. This should include the use of advance directives or other expressions of end-of-life preferences, and clear documentation of these conversations, especially if they take place during a telehealth visit.The following resources are available from the Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) and Respecting Choices:●CAPC COVID-19 Response Resources●Respecting Choices COVID-19 Tools and ResourcesFor cancer patients with COVID-19, who are at increased risk of needing mechanical ventilation or ICU care, a conversation about Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) is appropriate. Additional information is available at National POLST.Post-treatment surveillance — ASCO suggests that any clinic visits that can be postponed without risk to the patient should be postponed. This includes routine surveillance in patients who have completed treatment or those on active surveillance considered to be at relatively low risk of recurrence or disease progression, and those who are asymptomatic during the follow-up period. In situations where existing recommendations provide frequency ranges for interventions (eg, every three to six months), it is reasonable to delay scheduled interventions to the longest recommended frequency duration. Remote monitoring of such patients using telehealth may be adopted.Mental health issues — Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic is leading to mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear [56]. Cancer patients on and off treatment may have additional feelings of anxiety, fear, and vulnerability for disease recurrence or progression. As resources become constrained, cancer patients may feel loneliness and isolation as they watch their system swamped with cases that literally freeze them out. (See 'Allocation of limited health care resources' below.)Specific resources are available for patients. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)Clinicians are also at risk for increased anxiety and stress because of [57,58]:●Physical isolation from friends and family●Worry about their own health and health of family, peers, and colleagues●Competing demands of typical daily workload and COVID-19 response especially coupled with changes in family care responsibilities●Difficult choices and challenges in patient care, worry about patients, and the need to support patients and families during reduced visitationASCO has recommended mental health resources with tips on enhancing coping. The suggestions include avoiding information overload, and taking a break from news and social media regarding COVID-19. There is also a set of tips for enhancing mental and physical health during the pandemic.Resources are also available from the National Alliance on Mental Illness and a wide variety of other groups. (See 'Society guideline links' below and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Psychiatric symptoms and disorders"".)CANCER TYPE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCEConceptual framework for balancing competing risks — There are no international guidelines to address the management of cancer patients in any infectious pandemic. An algorithmic approach to solid tumors diagnosed during the pandemic has been proposed by an international group [59], but decision-making about whether specific treatments can be safely postponed or not requires a conceptual framework for balancing competing risks of the cancer and infection. A conceptual approach to decision-making regarding immediate cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic has been described, which attempts to balance the risk of progression with delay of cancer care versus the risk for significant morbidity from COVID-19 [60]. The list below presents examples that are meant to provide general guidance. Specific patient comorbidities as well as values and preferences must also be considered in each case. Specific considerations for lung cancer patients are discussed below. (See 'Patients with lung cancer' below.)●Based on low risk of progression in certain cancers, it may be safe to delay for more than three months certain treatments, regardless of age.•Examples include surgery and radiation (where indicated) for the following:-Nonmelanoma skin cancer.-Hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In such women, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be administered.•Similarly, medical oncology treatments may be delayed for chronic hematologic cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Specific guidance is available from the American Society of Hematology.●Based on intermediate risk of progression in other cancers, a delay of approximately three months may be acceptable in the some settings, particularly for individuals 50 and older. Examples are outlined below.•Surgery for the following:-High-risk prostate cancer (androgen deprivation may be started in the interim)-Colon cancer with low risk for imminent obstruction-Low-risk melanoma•Radiation for post-resection endometrial cancer and high-risk resected prostate cancer.•In selected cases, chemotherapy for advanced metastatic breast, colorectal, lung, and other solid tumors. However, these are difficult decisions, and must be individualized. For some patients with rapidly progressive metastatic disease or a high tumor burden, a delay of three months could be catastrophic. In such cases, shared decision-making is critically important. In contrast, active surveillance may be an appropriate option for some patients with slow-growing advanced disease, such as some patients with indolent or low tumor burden metastatic clear cell renal cancer [61]. (See ""Systemic therapy of advanced clear cell renal carcinoma"", section on 'Active surveillance'.)●By contrast, given a high risk of progression in certain cancers, ideally there would be no delay in treatments for the following individuals under age 70, although for older individuals, benefits of immediate treatment must be balanced against the risks. Examples are as follows:•Surgery for the following:-≥2 cm lung mass-Colon cancer with imminent obstruction-Type 2 endometrial cancer-Pancreatic, ovarian, or liver mass(es) suspicious for malignancy-High-risk non-muscle invasive or muscle invasive urothelial cancer•Radiation for the following:-Lung cancer-Locally advanced rectal cancer-Head and neck cancer•Chemotherapy for the following:-Acute leukemia, large cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, symptomatic myeloma, and all other non-low-grade hematologic cancers-Metastatic testicular cancer-Small cell lung cancer-Most head and neck cancers, except thyroidOther conceptual frameworks for prioritizing radiation and systemic treatment for cancer during the pandemic are available [62].In addition to potentially altering therapeutic protocols, other actions that have been suggested to increase the safety of managing oncologic care during the COVID-19 pandemic include screening all patients, caregivers, staff, and providers for COVID-19 symptoms; limiting exposure to sick contacts while on anticancer therapy; minimizing nonessential follow-up visits; restricting visitors to both outpatient and inpatient facilities; increasing engagement in telehealth and phone visits rather than in-person clinic visits; and prescribing oral drugs that can be taken at home, rather than injectable agents requiring administration in an infusion center, whenever possible.Guidance from expert groups — Guidance is available from several expert groups on how care for certain cancer types should be affected by COVID-19. The following is not an exhaustive list, and additional society guideline links are provided elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.). ●Breast cancer – In addition to guidance on breast cancer surgery from the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Breast Surgeons and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) have published brief, high-level guidance on prioritization for multidisciplinary care in breast cancer, and guidelines for radiation therapy for early breast cancer are available from an international group [63].●Gastrointestinal cancers – In addition to guidance on colorectal surgery from the American College of Surgeons, and on gastrointestinal tract cancer surgery from ESMO, an American group of oncologists has developed recommendations for minimizing risks to patients with gastrointestinal malignancies [64], and recommendations are also available from the US Colorectal Cancer Alliance.●Genitourinary cancers – In addition to guidance from ESMO, Canadian guidelines on prioritizing systemic therapy for patients with genitourinary malignancies are available, and there are also recommendations for triage of urologic surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic from a multidisciplinary group [65]. Recommendations for appropriate triage of outpatient procedures have also been proposed [66]. ●Gynecologic cancers – In addition to guidance form ESMO, and the American College of Surgeons, guidance for management of these cancers is available from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, the National College of French Gynecologists and obstetricians [67], from the editors of the International Journal of Gynecologic Cancer [68], and from the International Gynecologic Cancer Society. ●Head and neck cancer – Specific triage recommendations for head and neck cancer surgery are available from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center [69], and from a joint consensus group of the French Society of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery and the French Society of Head and Neck Carcinology [70].●Hematologic malignancy – In addition to guidelines from the American Society of Hematology, the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT), the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), and ESMO, the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance has published guidance on managing patients with hematologic malignancies, which is in press [71]. The International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group has issued guidance on alternative radiation treatment schemes in blood cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [50]. Additionally, an international group has published recommendations on the care of older patients with multiple myeloma [72], and the United States Cutaneous Lymphoma consortium has published recommendations on treatment of cutaneous lymphoma [73].●Hepatocellular carcinoma – In addition to ESMO, the International Liver Cancer Association has issued guidance on management of HCC during the COVID-19 pandemic, as has the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) [74] and the French Association for the Study of the Liver [75]. Additional information on issues relevant to solid organ transplantation is available elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"".)●Lung cancer – In addition to the American College of Surgeons, the Thoracic Surgery Outcomes Research Network has published guidance on triage for thoracic surgery in patients with thoracic malignancy [76]. Additionally, ESMO has laid out specific guidelines for the types of lung cancer care that should be considered high priority (should not be delayed), medium priority (should not be delayed more than six weeks), and low priority (patient condition is stable enough that services can be delayed for the duration of the pandemic, or the intervention is unlikely to have a significant magnitude of benefit). Guidance in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is provided by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC).Additional considerations for care of lung cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic are provided below. (See 'Patients with lung cancer' below.)●Neurooncology – Joint guidance on care of patients with brain tumors and brain metastases is available from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Tumor Section/Society for Neuro-Oncology [77], and specific guidance for management of glioma patients is available from an international multidisciplinary group [78].●Neuroendocrine tumors – Guidance in managing neuroendocrine tumors during the COVID-19 pandemic are available from the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS). SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONSUpper aerodigestive tract procedures — Because of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (eg, otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopists) are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations has been developed to guide evaluation and surgery of the head and neck during the pandemic [79]. At many institutions, testing for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is mandatory before such procedures are undertaken in patients. Given the significant risks of treating upper aerodigestive tract diseases in patients with COVID-19 and the uncertain but considerably lower specificity of current tests, two negative tests spaced ≥24 hours apart have been recommended for these patients. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Differentiating lymphangitic spread, pneumonitis, and COVID-19 — Some systemic cancer treatments are associated with a risk of pneumonitis (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors, gemcitabine, mechanistic (previously referred to as mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors). (See ""Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy"", section on 'Pneumonitis' and ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Molecularly targeted agents"" and ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with systemic antineoplastic therapy: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment"" and ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Molecularly targeted agents"", section on 'Rapamycin and analogs'.)In other cases, new infiltrates on radiographic imaging may reflect disease progression (eg, lymphangitic spread). Besides the fact that treatment-related pneumonitis might increase the risk of serious complications if the patient develops COVID-19, it may be difficult to distinguish therapy effect versus disease progression versus viral infection. In this setting, treatment should be held until it is clear that the diagnosis is not COVID-19. Testing for COVID-19 is appropriate in such circumstances, similar to the approach taken for patients with new respiratory symptoms. (See 'Patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)Managing subcutaneous ports — The typical frequency for maintenance flushing of subcutaneous ports is once every four to six weeks. However, at least some data suggest that extending the maintenance flushing interval of implanted ports in adult oncology patients to once every 12 weeks is safe and effective [80]. Patients who are capable of flushing their own devices may be encouraged to do so. However, the process of training may itself be a source of exposure and access to sterile supplies at home may be limited. (See 'Supportive care' above.)Cancer survivors — It is unclear if cancer survivors who have completed treatment are at increased risk for COVID-19 and its complications; such risk may be influenced by the type of cancer, treatment received, and patient age and comorbid medical conditions. The duration of time off therapy may be important, although late and long-term effects of prior treatment (ie, pulmonary or cardiac toxicities, persistent immunosuppression) may pose risks.Patients with long-term immune suppression may be at increased risk of infection. However, ASCO guidelines suggest that no recommendations can be made to alter care for these patients beyond the care they would normally receive. These high-risk patients should follow all of the general measures (eg, social isolation) advised by the CDC to minimize their exposure to potential infection. Patients who receive intravenous immunoglobulin should continue to receive it at the prescribed dose and schedule.Common questions about COVID-19 and answers for patients and cancer survivors are available from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (NCCS) [81]. In addition, a compilation of selected COVID-19 resources for cancer survivors and health care providers in the United States is available [82].Patients with lung cancer●SARS-CoV-2 testing – Some have advocated for SARS-CoV-2 testing in all lung cancer patients, regardless of symptomatology, given that these patients often have baseline pulmonary deficits and other comorbidities [83,84]. Although this is not yet standard practice everywhere, it is a reasonable approach if adequate testing is available.●Risk – There remains a lack of clarity regarding the effect of current versus previous cancer treatments and other comorbidities on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 [5]. However, patients with lung cancer may be at higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 than the general population; the disease may be more severe, and more often fatal, and COVID-19 may interfere with effective diagnostic and therapeutic lung cancer management [84]. It has also been postulated that smoking history and prior tobacco-related lung damage increase the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection [83,85]. Given all of these issues, such patients should be particularly cautious about exposure to COVID-19, given that many have baseline respiratory comorbidity or impairment due to the cancer itself, and should immediately report any new or changing symptoms to their clinicians.Evolving data indicate a high rate of severe disease and mortality from COVID-19 in patents with lung cancer:•In preliminary results of a multi-institutional international registry study including 200 patients with thoracic cancer also diagnosed with COVID-19 infection through laboratory tests, or with suspected COVID-19 infection based on exposure and symptoms, the majority of patients were hospitalized (76 percent), and one third of these patients died [86]. Despite the high rate of hospitalization, only 9 percent were admitted to an ICU, and 2.5 percent were mechanically ventilated, which could have influenced the high mortality rate. It has been suggested that these low numbers were potentially the result of equipment shortages or institutional policy.Regarding characteristics of included patients, approximately three-quarters of patients had metastatic disease. Approximately one third of all patients were receiving chemotherapy alone, one quarter were receiving immunotherapy alone, and 19 percent were receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone. However, in univariate analysis, there were no factors that were identified, including active cancer treatment, as being associated with mortality. •In a report cited above from a hospital system in New York City, the case fatality rate for individuals with lung cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 was 55 percent (6 of 11) [32]. (See 'Is illness more severe in patients with malignancy?' above.)•In a small series of seven patients from Wuhan, China, undergoing lung resection who contracted COVID-19 in the perioperative period, three died (mortality rate 42 percent) [87].●Impact on diagnosis and treatment•Distinguishing lung cancer evolution from a potential COVID-19 superinfection on the basis of radiologic or clinical presentation can be difficult. The main CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia can overlap with CT findings that are often found in patients with progressive lung cancer. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.)In addition, the worsening pulmonary symptoms during lung cancer progression can be similar to that typical of COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.) •Adding further complexity, pneumonitis can also be induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, an effective and widely used standard of care treatment for lung cancer in various treatment lines and settings [88]. Although the risk of pneumonitis is approximately 2 percent in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors for a variety of cancers, it may be higher in patients with lung cancer [89]. The clinical symptoms and radiologic imaging findings associated with pneumonitis may overlap with those of COVID-19.Pneumonitis may also complicate molecularly-targeted therapies such as osimertinib and standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Furthermore, cytotoxic chemotherapy can have immunosuppressive effects. (See ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Molecularly targeted agents"" and ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Cytotoxic agents"".)•The clinical and biologic aggressiveness of many lung cancers often does not allow for anticancer therapy to be withheld or postponed. ●Treatment•Specific guidance for lung cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is available from several expert groups. (See 'Cancer type-specific guidance' above.)Clinical trials — Clinical research has transformed cancer management and is often seamlessly integrated into routine oncologic care, offering eligible patients additional treatment options. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a major barrier to enrollment and ongoing participation in clinical trials, and it is leading programs to halt or prioritize screening and/or enrollment for certain clinical trials, and cease research-only visits [90]. The US FDA, the European Medicines Agency, and other international bodies have released guidance for sponsors and study sites to ensure the safety of trial participation, while maintaining regulatory compliance and minimizing risks to study integrity [91]. MINIMIZING THE COMPROMISE OF PHYSICAL DISTANCING DURING CANCER CARE DELIVERY — Patients undergoing cancer care including diagnosis, counseling, active treatment, and surveillance are highly exposed to medical centers, providers, staff, and other patients. This results in a massive number of personal contact points and a large number of potential opportunities for viral transmission for both patients and caregivers. ASCO guidelines recommend adoption of telemedicine visits for patients not requiring a physical exam, treatment, or in-office diagnostics.An important point is that while telemedicine is an important paradigm for patient provider communication, in an effort to maximize physical distancing, it has the potential to interrupt important aspects of the patient's relationships with the care team. This can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings as well as avoidable delays and even adverse events related to improper care. As patients and providers utilize telephone and video platforms to communicate and deliver care, both must accept the benefits as well as the risks. Operationalizing televisit workflows to mimic those that providers and patients are accustomed to in person may be helpful to maintain familiarity and avoid missed opportunities to improve care and communication.At the same time, personal contact often provides confidence, reassurance, and comfort that the patient is receiving optimal care. For patients who are already coming in to the cancer center for imaging, procedures, surgeries, radiation therapy, or infusions, a face-to-face visit remains an important option, with the usual precautions (masks, strict attention to hand hygiene). In general, minimizing time in waiting rooms, rearranging patient contact areas to maximize physical distancing, augmenting early discharge planning efforts, executing prompt and safe discharge events, minimizing visitors, instituting pharmacy deliveries, and anticipating/avoiding the possibility of urgent care/emergency department visits (eg, consider more delayed removal of drains/catheters based on risk benefit profile) are all necessary steps in creating a safe experience [92]. Both ASCO and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network have issued recommendations for oncology practices to keep patients with cancer, as well as their caregivers and health care staff, as safe as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic [44]. ALLOCATION OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE RESOURCES — The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging health care systems worldwide and raising important ethical issues, especially regarding the potential need for rationing health care in the context of scarce resources and crisis capacity. Limited availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) has complicated medical care of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 (and other transmissible conditions) worldwide. In general, physical distancing and barrier protective measures are the most potent forms of COVID-19 avoidance. We suggest following the CDC recommendations on face mask wearing. Further measures to prevent viral spread are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Local and regional considerations and policies should be informed on prevailing conditions. Special attention should be paid to augmenting PPE for care providers in close contact with known COVID-19-positive patients and those who manage the airway and respiratory tracts. Rapidly emerging data suggest that PPE such as N95 masks can safely be sterilized for reuse. In the United States, the CDC offers guidance on optimizing the supply of PPE when sudden increases in patient volume threaten a facility's PPE capacity. Strategies include canceling non-urgent procedures or visits that would warrant use of PPE, prioritizing the use of certain PPE for the highest risk situations, and cautious extended or limited reuse of PPE. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'When PPE is limited'.)Beyond the care of individual patients, oncology clinicians may face the reality of rationing care due to limited resources, particularly hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. In the face of limited resources, clinicians must consider carefully what cancer treatments are most likely to be successful, symptom-relieving, or life-saving, and identify those patients who are likely to get the greatest benefit from treatment [36,93]. If treatments are withheld, from a medico-legal standpoint, national and local guideline standards should be followed [94,95]. ASCO has released guidance on allocation of limited resources during the COVID-19 pandemic [96]. They emphasize that decisions regarding allocation of scarce resources should be separated from bedside decision-making. In addition, interim guidelines for use during the COVID-19 pandemic are available from the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) for use of PPE during clinical oncology care and for safe handling and administration of hazardous cancer drugs. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Surge capacity and scarce resource allocation'.)While high quality of and accessibility to care remains the greatest concern of providers, as resources become constrained, cancer patients may feel that their disease progression may become collateral damage to healthcare shortages and deferrals. Neither patients nor clinicians have any significant experience with rationing of care. Addressing fears such as these is critical to an open dialogue and may lead to opportunities to improve communication and prioritize care goals and shared decision-making. (See 'Mental health issues' above.)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored disease-specific guidelines (including those for hematology and oncology patients) from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Delivering cancer care during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is challenging given the competing risks of death from cancer versus death from infection, and the higher lethality of COVID-19 infection in immunocompromised hosts, among other reasons. Clinicians must balance the risks of delaying cancer treatments versus the risks for SARS CoV-2 exposure and the potential increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, while navigating the disruption in care associated with physical distancing and limited health care resources. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Data are limited but suggest that the likelihood of a severe illness from COVID-19 is higher among patients with cancer, particularly if they recently received or are continuing to receive treatment. It is unclear if cancer survivors who have completed treatment are at increased risk for COVID-19 and its complications; such risk may be influenced by the type of cancer, treatment received that could have resulted in long-term cardiopulmonary toxicity or immune system compromise, time since treatment, patient age and comorbid medical conditions. (See 'Is illness more severe in patients with malignancy?' above and 'Cancer survivors' above.)●For cancer patients with lower respiratory symptoms and/or signs (eg, fever, cough, dyspnea, or hypoxia), or those with exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19, we proceed with testing for SARS-CoV-2. These patients should also be evaluated for alternative causes of their symptoms. (See 'Patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)•For patients who test positive, immunosuppressive cancer treatments should be held at least until symptoms from COVID-19 have resolved. Some oral non-immunosuppressive therapies may be continued on a case-by-case basis.•While there are no universally accepted guidelines as to when immunosuppressive cancer therapies can be safely restarted after COVID-19 diagnosis, the effects of further suppressing or augmenting a patient's immune system quickly after COVID-19 must be weighed heavily against the risks of their unique tumor's biology. Our approach for most patients, which draws upon available guidelines and individual centers' ""best practices,"" is to hold immunosuppressives until symptoms from COVID-19 have resolved. Once symptoms have resolved, we retest for SARS-CoV-2 and proceed with planned cancer therapies only if a negative result is obtained. However, given a significant false negative rate in first-generation test kits, two consecutive negative tests ≥24 hours apart can be considered.However, there is no consensus on this issue, and at some institutions, more stringent guidelines are advocated, with delayed reinitiation of treatment until asymptomatic for at least 14 days and with two negative tests, at least 24 hours apart. Clinical judgment and individualized decision-making is needed, particularly in settings in which curative therapies are being withheld. (See 'When can cancer treatment be safely restarted?' above.)Patients with persistent viral shedding despite symptom resolution should stay on precautions/isolation until they convert to a negative test. Decision-making about reinitiation of chemotherapy is particularly difficult in these patients, particularly if the withheld treatments are potentially curative, and decisions must be individualized, carefully weighing the risks and benefits of withholding versus restarting treatment.•For patients who test negative, the approach depends on the cause for the respiratory symptoms and the cancer in question.●For patients without lower respiratory symptoms or signs or a known exposure, cancer patients are urged to follow the CDC's general recommendations in this regard, which are now that everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they go out in public. All patients should be informed regarding the symptoms of COVID-19, and trained in proper handwashing, hygiene, and minimizing exposure to sick contacts and large crowds. (See 'Should those receiving immunosuppressive therapy be tested?' above.)●Guidance regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing for asymptomatic cancer patients is evolving. Some institutions are routinely testing all cancer patients 48 to 72 hours prior to immunosuppressive therapies and prior to medical procedures. This policy is supported by updated guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America. However, test availability is still limited in many jurisdictions. Local and state public health directives and guidance on who should be tested, and the logistics for carrying out testing should be followed. (See 'Should those receiving immunosuppressive therapy be tested?' above.) ●A decision-making approach regarding immediate versus delayed cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is presented above, which balances the estimated risk of progression with delay of cancer care versus the risk for significant morbidity from COVID-19. Additionally, several groups have laid out cancer type-specific guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, individual patient morbidities and values and preferences must also be weighed in these decisions. (See 'Cancer type-specific guidance' above.)•Clinicians should proactively discuss goals of care and advance care planning, including advance directives, especially for those with advanced cancer who are or may be infected with COVID-19. (See 'Advance care planning' above.)●Given the number of opportunities for viral transmission for both patients and caregivers during cancer care, the use of video and/or telephone visits is encouraged, but both clinicians and patients must accept the benefits as well as the risks. When patients must receive in-person care, specific strategies can be used to accomplish physical distancing (eg, minimizing time in waiting rooms, minimizing/restricting visitors, instituting pharmacy deliveries, and avoiding emergency department visits, when possible). (See 'Minimizing the compromise of physical distancing during cancer care delivery' above.)●Limited availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) has complicated medical care of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 (and other transmissible conditions) worldwide. In general, physical distancing and barrier protective measures are the most potent forms of COVID-19 avoidance. We suggest following the CDC recommendations on facemask wearing and optimizing the supply of PPE when sudden increases in patient volume threaten a facility's PPE. (See 'Allocation of limited health care resources' above.)●Clinicians are at high risk for stress during the COVID-19 pandemic for a number of reasons. ASCO guidelines contain mental health resources with tips on enhancing coping and enhancing mental and physical health during the pandemic.

ID:127533,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues,"INTRODUCTION — Patients infected with the virus SARS-CoV-2 and its clinical disease COVID-19 are often minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic. More severe presentations include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.In some patients, the heart may be affected, and this can occur in individuals with or without a prior cardiovascular diagnosis. Evidence of myocardial injury, as defined as an elevated troponin level, is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with putative causes including stress cardiomyopathy, hypoxic injury, ischemic injury (caused by cardiac microvascular damage or epicardial coronary artery disease), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (cytokine storm). A minority of patients with an elevated troponin level present with symptoms and signs suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiogenic shock in acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Clinical presentation' and ""Approach to diagnosis and evaluation of acute decompensated heart failure in adults"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.) Patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are at increased risk of a poor prognosis. In addition, patients with myocardial injury, irrespective of cause, have a poorer prognosis.This topic will address our approach to the diagnosis and management of patients with either an acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary artery disease (CAD) who are suspected of or who have confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our approach and recommendations only apply during the pandemic and are superseded by routine care thereafter.The potential impact of the virus on the myocardium and conduction system is discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)Other relevant topics include:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronaviruses"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The prevalence of CAD in particular, and cardiovascular disease in general, varies from population to population. Thus, among patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19, there is a broad range for prevalent CAD. Rates between 4.2 and 25 percent have been reported, with most series from China [1-5]. Among patients admitted to intensive care units or those who died [5], the percent is higher. Myocardial injury (increased cardiac troponin or electrocardiographic [ECG] abnormalities) was present in 7.2 percent in one study [1], while other studies have shown elevated cardiac biomarkers in as many as 20 percent [6].IMPACT ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM — It is likely that COVID-19 directly and indirectly affects the cardiovascular system and the heart in particular. Potential mechanisms of cardiovascular injury have been identified and include direct myocardial injury from hemodynamic derangement or hypoxemia, inflammatory myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, microvascular dysfunction or thrombosis due to hypercoagulability, or systemic inflammation (cytokine storm), which may also destabilize coronary artery plaques [7]. Pneumonia and influenza infections have been associated with sixfold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) [8-10]. Patients with severe COVID-19 disease, such as those with high fever or hypoxia due to lung disease, may need a significant increase in cardiac output. Type II myocardial ischemia, therefore, may result in patients with obstructive CAD. (See ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Definitions'.) The clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection will, across a population, be greater in those with prior disease and increasing age. In one study, patients with prior cardiovascular disease made up 22.7 percent of all fatal cases, and the case fatality rate was 10.5 percent [11]. ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BASELINE CVD AND COVID-19 — There is substantial evidence of an association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, prior CAD, and the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection [2,3,12-15]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)The following three observational studies illustrate the magnitude of the relationship:●Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, the relationship between baseline CVD and in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was evaluated [16]. Of the 8910 patients with COVID-19, 515 died in the hospital (5.8 percent), and 8395 survived to discharge. Baseline CAD, relative to no disease, was independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death (10.2 versus 5.2 percent; odds ratio 2.70; 95% CI 2.08-3.51).●In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 72,314 cases (44,672 confirmed) reported by February 11, 2020 were reviewed [17]. The crude mortality rate was 2.3 percent. For age over 80, the case fatality rate was 14.8 percent. History of coronary heart disease (CHD) was present in 4.2 percent of all cases, but in 22.7 percent of fatal cases. Case fatality rates were 10.5 percent for CHD, 7.3 percent for diabetes, and 6 percent for hypertension. Another report evaluated 1099 cases from 30 provinces within mainland China [15]. Of these, 15.7 percent were classified as severe, and 6.1 percent had a primary endpoint, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. The presence of diabetes (severe versus nonsevere disease, 16.2 versus 5.7 percent; primary endpoint versus no primary endpoint, 26.9 versus 6.1 percent), hypertension (23.7 versus 13.4 percent; 35.8 versus 13.7 percent), or CHD (5.8 versus 1.8 percent; 9 versus 2 percent) was significantly more frequent among patients with severe disease versus nonsevere disease and with a primary endpoint versus no primary endpoint. In a report of 191 patients from Wuhan province who were diagnosed before January 31, 2020, there were significant univariate associations with death outcome for diabetes (31 versus 14 percent, p = 0.005), hypertension (48 versus 23 percent, p = 0.0008), and CHD (24 versus 1 percent, p<0.0001) [3]. In a multivariable analysis, only advancing age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and D-Dimer were associated with mortality. ●Another study found that the presence of acute injury determined by troponin elevation was a significant factor in the association of CVD and mortality [18] (see 'Troponin' below). Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, a history of CVD (defined as CHD, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy) was present in 66 (35 percent), and troponin was elevated in 52 (28 percent). Troponin elevation was more frequent in patients with CVD (55 percent, 36 of 66). Among patients with CVD and elevated troponin, the mortality rate was 69 percent (25 of 36). The mortality rate was 7.6 percent among patients without CVD and normal troponin, 13.3 percent among those with CVD and normal troponin, 37.5 percent among those without CVD and elevated troponin, and 69.4 percent among those with CVD and elevated troponin. Furthermore, troponin elevation correlated with elevations in C-reactive protein, and higher troponin elevations predicted higher mortality. Although the number of patients included limits interpretation, there is a suggestion that patients with underlying CVD (including hypertension) are both at increased risk for acute injury and worsened survival in the setting of injury. The cause of this association and whether injury indicates increased risk for MI or myocarditis will require additional investigation. Until more data with larger numbers of patients are available, it seems reasonable to consider all patients with history of CVD, hypertension, or diabetes at higher risk. We consider this risk likely to be highest for patients with these risk factors, older age, known history of heart failure, or clinically significant valvular disease. For now, there are no specific measures based on this risk stratification, but we advise all of our patients with these risk factors to be especially cautious regarding public health measures of social distancing, including with close family members. Furthermore, given the association with more severe disease and increased risk for acute myocardial injury, we advise early clinical evaluation for any suspect symptoms.ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME PATIENTSDefinitions — The term acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is applied to patients in whom there is a suspicion or confirmation of myocardial injury. ACS patients may have either ST-elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST elevation ACS, which includes non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) or unstable angina. According to the Fourth Universal Definition of MI (see ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Definitions'), the term acute MI should be used when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia and with detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin values with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit and at least one of the following [19]:●Symptoms of myocardial ischemia.●New ischemic ECG changes. (See 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis' below.)●Development of pathological Q waves.●Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology.●Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for type 2 or 3 MI).The Fourth Universal Definition of MI includes a clinical classification according to the assumed proximate cause of the myocardial ischemia:●Type 1: MI caused by acute atherothrombotic CAD and usually precipitated by atherosclerotic plaque disruption (rupture or erosion).●Type 2: MI consequent to a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand.With COVID-19 infection, the majority of MIs are type 2 and related to the primary infection, hemodynamic, and respiratory derangement. As such, the primary disorders should be treated, and in most cases the patient can be treated conservatively with regard to coronary disease. If a type 1 infarction is thought to be the primary etiology of the MI, standard therapies can be considered. (See ""Overview of the acute management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes"" and ""Overview of the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction"".)Clinical manifestations — The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of CAD. Patients may be tachycardic (with or without palpitations) in the setting of other illness-related symptoms. In patients with COVID-19 disease, the clinical manifestations of acute CAD are likely similar to those without the virus. (See ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)Few patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have complained of chest pain on admission, but the true prevalence and characteristics of chest pain among COVID-19 patients are unknown [1,20].Physicians report that there are fewer ACS patients presenting to the hospital during the pandemic. There is concern that patients with ACS are presenting later to emergency departments or not coming at all due to fear of exposure to patients with COVID-19. These patients will suffer unnecessary morbidity and mortality without proper ACS management. Health care providers should make every effort to persuade patients with complaints suggestive of ACS to seek proper evaluation while ensuring that appropriate screening and protection are available to avoid patient and provider concern regarding nosocomial spread of the infection. If admitted, it is prudent to screen all patients for symptoms of COVID-19 (eg, fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbance) regardless of primary complaint. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)The pandemic varies in terms of intensity between regions. There are epicenters with extreme COVID-19-associated disease burden, whereas other areas continue to see more regular ACS and only rarely COVID-19 patients. Assessment of COVID-19 status — ACS patients with unknown COVID-19 status are treated as potential COVID-19 patients since aerosolization during intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the catheterization laboratory is possible. Testing for COVID-19 is recommended for NSTEMI patients who are stable prior to transfer or catheterization. ST-elevation myocardial infarction — Irrespective of COVID-19 status, urgent or emergent diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve outcomes in patients with STEMI. Patients calling the health care system with ischemic-type chest pain or anginal equivalent should be urged to present to an emergency department. (See 'Acute coronary syndrome patients' above.)Patient and health care system factors have led to delays in the presentation of patients with STEMI. Later presentation has likely led to worse outcomes [21]. In addition, significant respiratory distress secondary to viral infection patients with STEMI has led to the use of fibrinolytic therapy when primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) might have otherwise been chosen (without COVID-19).Lastly, there have been reports of increased coronary artery thrombus burden in patients with STEMI [21]. This is consistent with an increased frequency of thrombotic strokes, particularly in young people, during the pandemic. Alterations in the coagulation system, abnormal platelet function, or abnormal endothelial function have been postulated [22]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".) Our approach to ST-elevation myocardial infarction — Our approach, which is summarized below, is generally in agreement with a provided algorithm (algorithm 1). The only way in which we differ slightly from the algorithm is that if we think STEMI with an occluded vessel is more likely than not, and that the benefit of a confirmed open artery is likely to impact overall recovery, we favor primary PCI. The following bullets summarize information contained in the next two sections. (See 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis' below and 'Management' below.)For COVID-19 patients or those under investigation [23]:●If the patient is not critically ill, we perform primary PCI (with masking of the patient) in most cases. We consider fibrinolytic therapy in lower-risk patients (eg, nonanterior MI, hemodynamic stability, not at high bleeding risk), particularly if there are personal protective equipment (PPE) limitations or a crisis surge in patients. (See ""Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: The use of fibrinolytic therapy"".)●In patients who are critically ill due to COVID-19 infection (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome multiorgan failure), the decision to reperfuse or not should be managed on a case-by-case basis. ●We perform primary PCI when the benefits appear more likely than not to have a positive impact on overall outcome. This requires weighing several factors on a case-by-case basis such as size of myocardial territory at risk, hemodynamic consequences of ongoing ischemia, and severity of nonischemic complications related to infection. Available local resources and the ability to protect the staff from infection also need to be taken into account. Some centers have chosen to administer fibrinolytic therapy in a minority of COVID-19 patients with STEMI and severe respiratory distress syndrome but who were not candidates for intubation because of age or comorbidities [21]. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis — The diagnosis of STEMI is normally not difficult. However, during the pandemic, alternative causes of myocardial injury (such as stress [takotsubo] cardiomyopathy or myocarditis) are important to consider (table 1). STEMI usually requires that the patient have chest pain or anginal equivalent symptomatology and ECG characteristics that include ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads (see ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'ST-elevation'):●New ST-segment elevation at the J-point in two contiguous leads with the cut-points: ≥0.1 mV in all leads other than leads V2 to V3. ●For leads V2 to V3: ≥2 mm in men ≥40 years of age, ≥2.5 mm in men <40 years of age, or ≥1.5 mm in women regardless of age.●In the absence of ST elevation on ECG, new left bundle branch block with anginal symptoms is considered to be a STEMI equivalent.However, ECG criteria are not specific for coronary artery thrombosis, particularly in COVID-19 patients in whom ST elevation may occur with stress cardiomyopathy or possibly myocarditis. Thus noncoronary artery COVID-19-associated myocardial injury needs to be carefully considered as a diagnostic possibility before reperfusion therapy is considered. In most patients with ST elevation, the diagnosis will be thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".) For patients with an elevated troponin and suspected STEMI, echocardiography is not generally used to identify which patients need emergent angiography since we believe the vast majority of patients require angiography regardless of echocardiographic findings. (See 'Echocardiography' below.)Management — For STEMI patients who are known to not be infected with the virus, we manage them with usual approach of primary PCI except that we mask all patients. If myocarditis seems more likely than STEMI (see 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis' above), we suggest a conservative approach with aspirin and heparin administration until the diagnosis becomes clearer. For confirmed cases or COVID-19 status under investigation in patients with STEMI, there are two important early management questions: ●Does the patient have a life-threatening (critical) illness, such as respiratory failure from COVID-19, that makes them a less-than-ideal candidate for reperfusion? Practitioners typically asked this question before revascularization in all patients prior to the pandemic. During the pandemic, it is an essential question.●During the pandemic, should fibrinolytic therapy be used more liberally as the choice for early reperfusion? With regard to the first issue, the harm associated with pursuing reperfusion therapy may exceed the anticipated gain in some COVID-19 patients, particularly if the primary competing illness portends a poor outcome. As is true for all patients with STEMI, comorbidities, size of infarction, delay to presentation, and hemodynamic status must be considered when determining if reperfusion therapy will be employed.Regarding the second issue, and with the understanding that PCI is generally preferred to fibrinolytic therapy, some experts have raised the possibility that a more liberal use of fibrinolytic therapy (than what is normally recommended) may be necessary in some settings due to resource utilization and risk of viral exposure for health care providers (see ""Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Selecting a reperfusion strategy"", section on 'Summary and recommendations'). The argument, in part, is that there will be less viral exposure to the catheterization laboratory staff. It should be recognized, however, that fibrinolysis may not reduce resource utilization during the pandemic since the majority of patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy will still require coronary angiography at some point during hospitalization, usually within 3 to 24 hours as part of a pharmacoinvasive or rescue strategy for fibrinolysis failure. These patients will require monitoring in an ICU, thereby utilizing a scarce resource and prolonging length of stay. Furthermore, there are some patients who may be exposed to the risk of bleeding from fibrinolysis, specifically intracranial hemorrhage, in the setting of myocarditis, and some may not realize the benefit of myocardial salvage in the context of a competing life-threatening illness or small territory at risk. As such, we continue to prefer PCI as the reperfusion strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the decision must be considered in the larger context of the availability of resources within the system, as well as important patient factors including age, infarct location, and duration of symptoms that influence fibrinolysis efficacy, bleeding risk, and the chances of substantial myocardial salvage.When deciding between primary PCI and fibrinolytic therapy, factors such as significant associated comorbidities and hospital resource limitations should be taken into account. For example, a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory failure may not be an optimal candidate to reap the benefit of myocardial reperfusion, while a patient with suspected COVID-19 and mild or moderate infection is likely to benefit from myocardial salvage, and if the resources are available, then reperfusion should be performed despite the risk to providers and the resources required.Irrespective of the initial reperfusion strategy, we treat all STEMI patients with early aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, and anticoagulation. High-dose statin is started as soon as possible after the diagnosis.Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction — NSTEMI patients require urgent management but generally do not require a catheterization laboratory emergently (see ""Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes: Revascularization"", section on 'Timing'). In the face of resource limitation during the COVID-19 pandemic, any decision to proceed with an invasive strategy should take into account current health care resources. In some geographies, cardiac catheterization laboratories have been converted to ICUs.For patients in whom medical therapy is likely to lead to a worse outcome (ie, higher-risk patients) (see ""Risk stratification after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome"", section on 'Very high-risk patients' and ""Risk stratification after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome"", section on 'Early risk stratification tools'), we attempt to utilize the catheterization laboratory. We perform urgent catheterization on NSTEMI patients for reasons such as ongoing evidence of myocardial ischemia (eg, repetitive episodes of angina or dynamic ECG changes, ventricular arrhythmias, or heart failure). Other complications have included arrhythmias and shock. In one study, these were reported in 17, 7, and 9 percent of patients, respectively [1]. In a series of 21 severely ill patients admitted to the ICU in the United States, one-third developed cardiomyopathy [24]. Diagnosis uncertain — Where there is uncertainty as to whether the individual has an ACS due to plaque rupture, combined use of clinical evaluation and ECG are usually sufficient to make a decision. (See ""Evaluation of emergency department patients with chest pain at low or intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome"" and ""Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department"".) Consultation with a cardiologist is suggested for cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain.Echocardiography — Among patients with COVID-19 with suspected ACS, the role of echocardiography in altering the pretest probability of CAD is limited to low- or intermediate-risk patients. In patients with COVID-19, an echocardiogram may be performed if requested by a consulting cardiologist and is expected to have a significant impact on management or is likely to change the patient's prognosis. (See ""Noninvasive testing and imaging for diagnosis in patients at low to intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome"" and ""Evaluation of emergency department patients with chest pain at low or intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome"".)Findings on an echocardiogram that favor a condition other than ACS (eg, stress cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, pericarditis, or noncardiac cause of chest pain) include:●No wall motion abnormalities during chest pain.●Wall motion abnormalities not supportive of regional injury suggested by the ECG.●Wall motion abnormalities in a noncoronary distribution.●Less specific findings, such as small pericardial effusion.It is recognized that focal wall motion abnormalities may be present in patients with noncoronary myocardial injury and conversely that global dysfunction may accompany ACS, and so the echocardiography cannot be the sole determinant of whether reperfusion therapy is pursued. The role of echocardiography in patients with COVID-19 without suspected ACS is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)Cardiogenic shock — The primary disorder in the majority of patients with severe COVID-19 infection is hypoxia-related respiratory failure. A proportion develop systemic hyperinflammatory response and vasodilatory shock as the viremia clears. This phase of illness may be accompanied by concomitant myocardial suppression and cardiogenic shock. This mixed etiology of shock can be difficult to manage, particularly if the patient has preexisting cardiovascular dysfunction. It has been observed infrequently that more severe cardiovascular dysfunction occurs with mild respiratory compromise and inflammation. It is possible that these patients are suffering from myocardial injury as a manifestation of or response to the infection [25]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults"", section on 'Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)There are anecdotal reports of patients recovering from the respiratory illness with subsequent abrupt cardiovascular collapse. Whether this is related to an inflammatory or some other process remains uncertain. It remains to be described whether an unchecked inflammatory response results in this late hemodynamic sequelae. Other issuesIssues facing catheterization laboratory personnel — We generally agree with approaches outlined in a report from the American College of Cardiology's Interventional Council and the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention [26]. Similar protocols have been created, including one from the Interventional Cardiology Association and Heart Rhythm Association of the Spanish Society of Cardiology [27]. Efforts should be made to avoid the patient remaining in waiting areas and halls, particularly in which staff will be directly interacting with the patient. Equipment for PCI (eg, sheath, guiding catheter, and possibly a workhorse wire and balloon) should be placed in the room prior to patient arrival to avoid repeated entry and exit of the staff.We encourage training and simulation in donning and doffing PPE, observing to monitor adherence to best practices, and reading the proper sequences (figure 1 and figure 2) [28] (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Precautions' and 'Donning and doffing personal protective equipment' below). We recommend daily checks to ensure adequate PPE is available and standard checks of the ""code"" or ""crash"" cart. There is no consensus as to whether positive-pressure catheterization rooms should be converted to no-pressure or negative-pressure rooms. If resources allow, it appears prudent to designate one room for suspected/confirmed COVID-19-positive patients, recognizing this may not be possible in some situations. Equipment in closed cabinets is not thought to require disinfectant after a procedure that involves a patient with established or suspected COVID-19, but only a minimal amount of supplies and equipment should be kept in this room. Unused equipment that is not covered, especially if the procedure involved aerosolization (eg, intubation, transesophageal echocardiography, cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]), should be discarded or the packaging should be disinfected before additional use. The minimal number of personnel should enter the room, with at least the operator or a nurse in the room and a technologist in the control booth. Donning and doffing personal protective equipment — A reasonable sequence for donning and doffing PPE is as follows (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings""):●Remove any personal items.●Put on the lead apron.●Put on a disposable gown.●Gather the necessary PPE and check for their integrity.●Perform hand hygiene with alcohol hand gel/rub.●Put on the proper disposable respirator (N95 or FFP2 standard; FFP3 is available for anesthesiologists and nurses helping with airways maneuvers).●Put on hair cover.●Put on shoe covers.●Put on goggles and/or face shield, avoiding any interference with the respirator.●Perform hand hygiene. ●Put on the first pair of gloves.●Put on a second gown (sterile or not, according to your role in catheterization laboratory) not using the inside tie. ●Put on a second pair of gloves (over cuff), sterile if needed.A safe doffing area should be identified in each catheterization laboratory, in particular if no anteroom or exists. If no anteroom is available, doffing of PPE could be done inside the laboratory, at the end of procedure, and when the patient has been transferred away. Only the facial respirator must be removed outside the contaminated area. The following are sequential steps:●Avoid any contact with your face, hair, and eyes before completing the entire doffing process.●Place any disposable PPE in the clinical waste bin.●Do not fill the clinical waste bin more than three-fourths full in order to be able to close it safely without squeezing contaminated materials to avoid aerosolization.●Reprocess the non-disposable PPE.Inside the catheterization laboratory:●Wait until the patient is out of the room; close the door.●Perform hand hygiene over the gloves.●Peel off gown and gloves together and roll inside, slowly and carefully, avoiding aerosolization.●If gloves are removed separately, touch only the external part (use glove-in-glove or beak technique).●Perform hand hygiene (over the internal gloves).●Remove face shield and/or goggles, avoiding contact with face and eyes, and dispose them safely or put into a separate container for reprocessing.●Perform hand hygiene (over the internal gloves).●Remove hair cover and dispone it safely.●Remove shoe covers and dispone them safely.●Perform hand hygiene (over the internal gloves).●Remove internal gloves and dispose them safely.●Perform hand hygiene.●Step out of the catheterization laboratory and immediately close the door.Outside the operating room:●Put on another pair of gloves●Remove facial respirator without touching the front side of the respirator●Remove the gloves●Remove lead apron●Perform hand hygiene with soap, water, and alcohol gel/rubNo guidelines have been issued that address whether health care workers exposed to blood of COVID-19 patients should be managed any differently than usual. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation — A discussion of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in COVID-19 patients is presented separately. (See ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"", section on 'Resuscitation of patients with COVID-19'.) Prognosis — Prognosis for patients with COVID-19 is worse with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. In an early report from China, mortality was 10.5 percent in patients with cardiovascular disease [29].Mortality rates appear to increase significantly with increasing age; case fatality rates <1 percent have been reported for those under 50 years of age, with rates approaching 15 percent for patients 80 years of age or older [12]. Similarly, mortality increases with disease severity, as there were no deaths reported among the mild or severe cases in the Chinese cohort, but mortality approached 50 percent among critically-ill patients [12]. Underlying medical comorbidities appear to significantly impact COVID-19 severity and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and hypertension have been reported to have significantly high-case fatality rates compared with patients without these underlying comorbidities (10.5 and 6 percent mortality, respectively, compared with 0.9 percent mortality without underlying comorbidities) [12,30].In addition, reports have found that the higher the troponin level, the worse the prognosis. This has been generally found in other situations. (See ""Troponin testing: Clinical use"", section on 'Prognosis' and ""Troponin testing: Clinical use"", section on 'General population'.)STABLE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS — We do not change our usual management of CAD in patients with COVID-19 infection, with one exception: We attempt to delay elective revascularization procedures in patients for whom the indication is relief of symptoms. Such an approach protects the patient and health care workers from potential viral exposure. For patients who must have revascularization for reasons such as extremely poor quality of life or prolongation of life, as with significant left main CAD, we test the patient for COVID-19 infection.Decisions regarding the type of revascularization (eg, coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) in these patients may be altered during the pandemic, favoring PCI as a method to shorten the duration of exposure of the patient to the hospital environment. We encourage heart team discussion with inclusion of the patient regarding these issues. We do not routinely test the patient for COVID-19 infection in this setting. None of the usual medications for the management of CAD, such as aspirin, beta blockers, statins, and nitrates, have been associated with worse outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 infection. We continue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'ACE inhibitors/ARBs'.)Patients admitted for management of COVID-19 — Many patients admitted for management of COVID-19 will have stable CAD. (See 'Epidemiology' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'General management issues'.)Electrocardiogram — All patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected should have a baseline ECG performed at the time of entry into the hospital. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single-lead or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient. This will allow for documenting baseline QRS-T morphology should the patient develop signs/symptoms suggestive of myocarditis or an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the baseline ECG allows for documentation of the QT (and corrected QTc) interval. Importantly, QTc will need to be monitored if QT-prolonging therapies are initiated (eg, azithromycin, chloroquine, etc) to reduce the risk of acquired long QT syndrome. (See ""Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)'.)Troponin — Cardiac troponin elevation is seen in about 20 to 30 percent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is associated with a higher mortality [3,18,30]. Most patients with troponin elevation and COVID-19 do not have a clinical presentation suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). (See 'Association between baseline CVD and COVID-19' above.)The optimal use of troponin testing in hospitalized COVID-19 patients without suspected ACS is not known. Many centers obtain a troponin soon after admission in all patients, as it may have prognostic value and may serve as a useful baseline for comparison in patients who subsequently develop manifestations of possible myocardial injury (such as heart failure or arrhythmia) [31]. Other centers limit troponin testing in this setting to patients with a specific indication (such as suspected ACS based on clinical presentation or new onset heart failure), as the clinical value of troponin levels has not been established, and results may lead to unnecessary use of medical resources (eg, serial troponins, ECGs, and cardiology consultations for elevated troponin) [32]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●A relatively high percent of patients admitted with COVID-19 will have underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). For most, symptoms of CAD will not be present on admission. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●It is likely that COVID-19 directly and indirectly affects the cardiovascular system, causing or contributing to acute coronary syndromes (ACS), myocarditis, and electrical heart disease. (See 'Impact on the cardiovascular system' above.)●Health care providers should make every effort to persuade patients to seek proper evaluation if the diagnosis of ACS is considered. (See 'Acute coronary syndrome patients' above.)●In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, we approach the diagnosis and management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) similar to those without. On occasion, it is reasonable to liberalize the use of fibrinolytic therapy relative to primary percutaneous coronary intervention.

(See 'Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction' above.)●We do not change our usual management of CAD in patients with COVID-19 infection with one exception: We attempt to delay elective revascularization procedures in patients for whom the indication is relief of symptoms.

ID:127552,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (ie, SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. By 2020, it led to a pandemic that has spread throughout most countries of the world. SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) primarily manifests as a lung infection with symptoms ranging from those of a mild upper respiratory infection to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. COVID-19 disproportionately affects patients with pre-existing comorbidities, such as patients with various types of kidney disease. All medical professionals, including nephrology clinicians, are tasked with rapidly adjusting their practice to curtail the spread of the virus, while providing life-sustaining care to their patients.This topic will discuss issues related to COVID-19 and delivery of nephrology care in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypertension. Issues related to the care of patients who are candidates for or have a kidney transplant are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"".)Other important aspects of COVID-19 that may affect this population are discussed at length elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".) ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Fluid and electrolytes management'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)END-STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE — Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 due to the older age and high frequency of comorbidity, such as diabetes and hypertension, in this population [1]. Management of patients with ESKD varies based upon whether they are hospitalized or are in the outpatient setting. Outpatients with ESKD — A majority of patients with ESKD are treated with some form of dialysis. These include in-center hemodialysis, home hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis — Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis typically present to an outpatient facility three times per week to undergo dialysis. This limits their ability to observe physical isolation for infection control. Thus, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Society of Nephrology (ASN), and International Society of Nephrology (ISN) have issued interim guidelines and a list of resources to guide nephrology clinicians providing life-sustaining dialysis care [2,3]. These resources continue to evolve and are frequently updated. At a minimum, all dialysis organizations are urged to follow the recommendations from these guidelines. Some dialysis organizations may choose to follow additional measures to protect the health care staff and patients, depending upon their access to personal protective equipment and other resources.Early recognition/isolation of individuals with respiratory symptoms — Outpatient dialysis facilities should, at minimum, heed the following guidance [4]: ●Implement non-punitive and flexible sick leave policies that permit ill health care personnel to stay home. Health care personnel should be reminded to not report to work when they are ill. ●Identify patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection (eg, fever, cough) before they enter the treatment area.•Instruct patients to call ahead to report fever or respiratory symptoms so the facility can be prepared for their arrival or triage them to a more appropriate setting (eg, an acute care hospital).•Patients should inform staff of fever or respiratory symptoms immediately upon arrival at the facility (eg, when they check in at the registration desk).•Patients with symptoms of a respiratory infection should put on a facemask at check-in and should wear it until they leave the facility.●Provide patients and health care personnel with instructions (in appropriate languages) regarding hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette.•Instructions should include how to use facemasks, how to use tissues to cover the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, how to dispose of tissues and contaminated items in waste receptacles, and how and when to perform hand hygiene.•Signs should be posted at clinic entrances with instructions for patients to alert staff so appropriate precautions can be implemented for patients who have a fever or symptoms of a respiratory infection.●Position hygiene-related supplies in close proximity to dialysis chairs and nursing stations to enable adherence to hand and respiratory hygiene. These supplies include tissues and no-touch receptacles for disposal of tissues as well as hand hygiene supplies (eg, alcohol-based hand sanitizer).Patient placement — Outpatient dialysis facilities should, at minimum, heed the following guidance: ●Provide sufficient space in waiting areas for patients to sit separated from other patients by at least six feet. Medically stable patients might opt to wait in a personal vehicle or outside the health care facility where they can be contacted by mobile phone when it is their turn to be seen.•Patients with respiratory symptoms should be brought back to an appropriate treatment area as soon as possible in order to minimize time in waiting areas.•If possible, facilities should maintain at least six feet of separation between patients. If not possible, then six feet of separation should be maintained between masked, symptomatic patients and other patients during dialysis treatments. Ideally, symptomatic patients would be dialyzed in a separate room (if available) with the door closed.-Hepatitis B isolation rooms should be used for dialysis patients with symptoms of respiratory infection only if the room is not needed to dialyze a hepatitis B infected patient. -If a separate room is not available, masked patients should be dialyzed in corner or end-of-row stations and be separated from other patients in all directions by at least six feet.Personal protective equipment — In general, health care personnel caring for patients with undiagnosed respiratory infections should follow standard, contact, and droplet precautions with eye protection unless the suspected diagnosis requires airborne precautions (eg, tuberculosis). This includes the use of:•Gloves•Facemask•Eye protection (eg, goggles, a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face). Personal glasses and contact lenses are not considered adequate eye protection.•Isolation gown-The isolation gown should be worn over or instead of the cover gown (ie, laboratory coat, gown, or apron with incorporate sleeves) that is normally worn by health care personnel. If the supply of such gowns is low, then they should be prioritized for the initiation and termination of the hemodialysis treatment, manipulation of access needles or catheters, and for aiding the patient into and out of the station. They should also be used for cleaning and disinfection of patient care equipment and the dialysis station.-When gowns are removed, place the gown in a dedicated container for waste or linen before leaving the dialysis station. Disposable gowns should be discarded after use. Cloth gowns should be laundered after each use.Additional measures for COVID-19 — When COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed in a patient receiving hemodialysis at the facility, the following additional measures apply:●If a hemodialysis facility is dialyzing more than one patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, an attempt should be made to cohort these patients, as well as the health care personnel caring for them, together in the same section of the unit and/or on the same shift (eg, schedule all such patients for the last shift of the day). If the etiology of respiratory symptoms is known, patients with different etiologies should not be cohorted together; as an example, patients with confirmed influenza and COVID-19 should not be cohorted together.●The health department should be notified about the patient.●Health care personnel should follow the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings. This includes recommendations on personal protective equipment. Routine cleaning and disinfection are appropriate for COVID-19 in dialysis settings. Any surface, supplies, or equipment (eg, dialysis machine) located within six feet of symptomatic patients should be disinfected or discarded.•Products with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are recommended for use against SARS-CoV-2. Refer to List N on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA's emerging viral pathogens program from use against SARS-CoV-2.•When using products from List N, facilities should ensure the products also have a bloodborne pathogen claim (eg, hepatitis B, HIV).Patients receiving home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis — Our approach to patients receiving home dialysis is as follows:●In general, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients receiving dialysis at home (ie, home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) should have their regular follow-up visits performed via telemedicine rather than via in-person, in-clinic visits. In addition, home visits by health care professionals should be minimized or stopped.Patients should have at least two weeks of dialysis supplies and sufficient medications in case they have to self-isolate, or in case there is a break in the supply chain (eg, due to delivery staff sickness).Staff nurses should communicate with patients frequently to distinguish and handle the most dangerous and severe cases in a timely manner and by referring patients to the emergency department, when appropriate. Unexpected or emergency visits to the clinic should be avoided as much as possible.●However, patients occasionally may need to be seen in-person for various issues (eg, home hemodialysis training, suspected exit-site infection, suspected peritonitis). If an in-person visit is clinically indicated:•Attempt to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This includes early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, as well as the use of appropriate personal protective equipment. A detailed discussion of infection control practices for the health care setting is presented separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)•Attempt to limit the number of patients seen in-person during a given day in order to avoid crowded waiting areas and to minimize contact. •Avoid non-essential procedures in order to minimize unnecessary patient contact. In the peritoneal dialysis unit, for example, procedures such as peritoneal equilibration test (PET) testing and clearance measurements should be deferred. However, procedures that are necessary for placement and maintenance of adequate dialysis access (eg, arteriovenous fistula procedures, placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter) are considered essential and should not be deferred. (See 'Dialysis access planning in advanced CKD' below.)Hospitalized patients with ESKD — The American Society of Nephrology has issued guidelines for nephrology clinicians caring for hospitalized patients requiring dialysis for ESKD. In addition, the CDC has issued interim guidance for care of hospitalized patients, which are applicable for those hospitalized with kidney disease. These guidelines continue to evolve and are frequently updated. Understandably, the execution of some of these guidelines will be limited by policies enforced at the level of any institution. However, when possible, adherence to these guidelines is encouraged.●Patients with COVID-19 should be co-localized on a floor or intensive care unit, when possible. Co-localization within adjacent rooms can enable one dialysis nurse to simultaneously deliver dialysis for more than one patient.●When possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are not critically ill should be dialyzed in their own isolation room rather than being transported to the inpatient dialysis unit.●Where available, telemedicine interfaces with a camera should be used to troubleshoot alarms from outside the room and to minimize the need for the dialysis nurse or the nephrologist to enter an isolation room.Patients receiving intermittent peritoneal dialysis who have multiple organ dysfunction can be temporarily switched to automated peritoneal dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). As in patients on hemodialysis, it is advisable to prevent hypervolemia, so increased ultrafiltration may be needed if remaining on peritoneal dialysis.There are a variety of opinions for disposal of drained dialysate from peritoneal dialysis patients with COVID-19 ranging from only performing standard methods to additional disinfection with mixture of 500 mg/L chlorine-containing solution with the dialysate and disposing the dialysate into the toilet after one hour. It is important to emphasize the need to prevent accidental splash when disposing of drained dialysate.ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY — Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may present with acute kidney injury (AKI) as part of their overall illness. In observational data from Wuhan, AKI has been reported in 25 to 29 percent of patients who were critically ill or deceased [5,6]. The incidence of AKI among infected patients (including those with and without critical illness) is approximately 5 percent [7]. However, these data are too preliminary to definitively establish the true incidence of AKI associated with COVID-19.Clinical characteristics and histopathology — Kidney disease among patients with COVID-19 can manifest as AKI, hematuria, or proteinuria, and portends a higher risk of mortality [7-10]. It remains unclear if AKI is largely due to hemodynamic changes and cytokine release or if the virus also leads to direct cytotoxicity. In a single-center prospective cohort study of 701 patients, of which 13 percent had pre-existing kidney disease, AKI occurred in five percent [7]. In addition, 44 percent had proteinuria and 27 percent had hematuria. The presence of AKI, hematuria, or proteinuria, and pre-existing kidney disease were independently associated with a higher risk of death. Kidney histopathology was examined in an autopsy series of 26 patients who died of respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 [9]. Mean age of the patients included was 69 years (range, 39 to 87 years); eleven patients had diabetes, hypertension, and/or chronic kidney disease at baseline, and nine had new kidney injury during hospitalization in the form of creatinine elevation or new-onset proteinuria. All patients had evidence of acute tubular injury (of varying severity); a range of other histopathology findings, such as erythrocyte clusters and pigmented casts, were also present. Of the nine samples tested for intracellular virus, particles resembling coronaviruses were identified in seven. Of these seven patients, immunostaining was positive for SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody in three. Two separate case reports have also described collapsing glomerulopathy among black patients presenting with severe AKI and nephrotic-range proteinuria [8,10].Evaluation of AKI in hospitalized patients — In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who develop AKI, an emphasis should be placed on optimization of volume status to exclude and treat prerenal (functional) AKI while avoiding hypervolemia, which may worsen the patient's respiratory status.The evaluation for other AKI etiologies should be undertaken in a manner similar to other critically ill patients with AKI. As an example, manual urine sediment examination should be performed, if appropriate, since urine samples are not considered to be highly infectious. However, some testing that is typically available may not be possible in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. As an example, kidney and bladder ultrasound may not be able to be performed due to exposure concerns.Management of AKI in hospitalized patientsPatients with dialysis-requiring AKI — The indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT) for AKI remain the same regardless of the COVID-19 status of any given patient. Alterations in RRT management that might be undertaken during the COVID-19 outbreak include the following:●Patients with COVID-19 and AKI who require RRT should be co-localized on a floor or intensive care unit, when possible. Co-localization within adjacent rooms can enable one dialysis nurse to simultaneously deliver dialysis to more than one patient. If a patient is in a negative-pressure isolation room, then one hemodialysis nurse will need to be dedicated for the care of that patient in a 1:1 nurse-to-patient ratio.●If at all possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are not critically ill but who have AKI requiring RRT should be dialyzed in their isolation room rather than being transported to the inpatient dialysis unit.●Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains preferred among critically ill patients with AKI. Even among patients who are hemodynamically stable and could tolerate intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), CRRT or prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT; also called sustained low-efficiency dialysis or SLED) should be performed instead, depending upon machine and staffing availability. This is because CRRT or PIRRT can be managed without 1:1 hemodialysis nursing support. This would potentially help minimize wastage of personal protective equipment and limit exposure among hemodialysis nurses.●CRRT machines can either be placed inside an isolation room as per standard practice or outside the room with the use of extended tubing. Placing the machine outside of the room minimizes the need for repeated entry to troubleshoot and manage the machine, and therefore reduces wastage of personal protective equipment. However, extended tubing is a scarce resource. In addition, use of extended tubing requires additional tubing connections and increases the likelihood that tubing will become disconnected. Extended tubing also decreases the sensitivity of pressure alarms to detect disconnection of the venous lines, and potentially increases the risk of clotting due to the longer tubing length.  ●If CRRT capacity at an institution is overwhelmed, CRRT machines can be used to deliver prolonged intermittent treatments (eg, 10 hours rather than continuous) with higher flow rates (eg, 40 to 50 mL/kg/hour). Alternatively, the machine can be rotated between patients every 24 hours or whenever the circuit clots, so that use of new filter sets is minimized. This will enable the CRRT machine to become available sooner for care of another patient after terminal cleaning.●Institutions facing scarcity of replacement fluid for CRRT can lower the delivered dose to 15 mL/kg/hour from the standard 20 to 25 mL/kg/hour, especially among patients who are not hypercatabolic. When supplies of commercially prepared replacement fluid are exhausted, institutional pharmacies may develop their own replacement fluid by mixing all of the following (in a sterile fashion) [11]:•1 L of 0.9 percent saline with potassium chloride as needed•1 L of 5 percent dextrose water with 150 mEq sodium bicarbonate•1 L of 0.9 percent saline with 1 g magnesium chloride•1 L of 0.9 percent saline with 1 g calcium chlorideThis will yield a 4 L solution containing 153 mEq/L sodium, 37.5 mEq/L bicarbonate, 2.6 mmol/L magnesium, 2.25 mmol/L calcium, and a variable amount of potassium.Another option for preparation of a dialysate solution is the Cleveland Clinic method. ●Anecdotal evidence suggests that circuit thrombosis during RRT occurs more frequently in patients with COVID-19 than in other patients. In the absence of contraindications, patients with COVID-19 should receive anticoagulation during RRT. This can be in the form of regional anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin or citrate, or systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular weight heparin. Institutions that have no prior experience with regional citrate anticoagulation should avoid adopting a new citrate protocol during this crisis in order to minimize risks of treatment errors that can lead to citrate toxicity. Additional details regarding anticoagulation for the hemodialysis procedure are presented separately. (See ""Anticoagulation for the hemodialysis procedure"" and ""Anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy"".) ●Where available, remote monitoring with audio and video streams should be used to troubleshoot alarms from outside the room and to minimize the need for the dialysis nurse or the nephrologist to enter an isolation room.●No special provisions or methods for disposal of the CRRT effluent are necessary. This is because neither presence of SARS-CoV-2 nor other similar viruses have been demonstrated in the effluent. ●When available hemodialysis or CRRT machines are scarce, clinicians may need to consider treatment of AKI with peritoneal dialysis. Important considerations include: •Patients with AKI who are treated with peritoneal dialysis have similar rates of all-cause mortality, kidney function recovery, and infectious complications compared with patients treated with other modalities. (See ""Use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults"", section on 'Outcomes with PD for AKI'.)•Peritoneal dialysis requires relatively less equipment, infrastructure, and resources relative to other forms of RRT. Nurses and clinicians can be trained expeditiously to provide peritoneal dialysis. (See ""Use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults"", section on 'Outcomes with PD for AKI'.)•Peritoneal dialysis can increase intra-abdominal pressure, interfere with respiratory mechanics [12], and may theoretically worsen respiratory failure, particularly among mechanically ventilated patients. However, it can be used among mechanically ventilated patients when other options such as intermittent hemodialysis and CRRT are not available. Performing peritoneal dialysis in a mechanically ventilated patient who requires a prone position may be challenging, although one case report found it to be feasible and safe [13]. (See ""Use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults"", section on 'Complications of PD for AKI'.)•When peritoneal dialysis is used for management of AKI in patients with COVID-19, automated peritoneal dialysis with a cycler should be used, if available. This minimizes the contact between health care personnel and the patient. (See ""Use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults"", section on 'Selecting PD modalities for AKI'.)•Similar to disposal of peritoneal dialysis effluent for patients with end-stage kidney disease, there are a range of opinions for safe disposal of the effluent in the setting of AKI. Data suggesting that peritoneal dialysis effluent is infectious are lacking. (See 'Hospitalized patients with ESKD' above.)●Extracorporeal hemoperfusion devices for cytokine removal, such as Cytosorb, have had no clear role in management of sepsis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to lack of proven benefit, we do not use Cytosorb or other similar devices among critically ill COVID-19 patients with or without dialysis-requiring AKI. (See ""Investigational and ineffective therapies for sepsis"", section on 'Cytokine and endotoxin inactivation or removal'.)Data regarding the threshold for SARS-CoV-2 testing (eg, benefits of testing patients with mild symptoms not requiring hospitalization), or about safety of antiviral agents for treatment of COVID-19 among patients with kidney disease remains unknown. Patients with AKI that is not dialysis-requiring — Patients who have AKI that is not dialysis-requiring should be managed with limited contact as much as possible. Physical examination and ultrasound evaluations should be coordinated with the primary/consulting teams to minimize contact, when possible. Differences in management of AKI among patients with COVID-19 may include limited use of intravenous fluids. Most patients with COVID-19 characterized by pneumonia have variable degree of oxygen requirements and/or airway control. Fluid resuscitation goals are understandably conservative as per various acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria. Thus, fluid resuscitation should be individualized and based on trackable objective measures (eg, inferior vena cava collapse on ultrasound). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Fluid and electrolytes management'.)CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION — Among patients with COVID-19, both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension are risk factors for more severe disease [14-17]:●In a meta-analysis of four studies and 1389 infected patients (including 273 patients with severe disease), the prevalence of underlying CKD was more frequent among those with severe disease (3.3 versus 0.4 percent; odds ratio 3.03, 95% CI 1.09-8.47) [17].●In the same cohort of 1389 patients from these four studies, history of hypertension was more common among those who had severe, as compared with nonsevere, COVID-19 (15 versus 32 percent) [17]. Similarly, in a separate cohort of 1590 hospitalized patients in China, underlying hypertension was independently associated with severe COVID-19 (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.07-2.32) [14]. Studies conducted in the United States and Italy reveal broadly consistent findings [15,16].Renin angiotensin system inhibitors — Patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents (unless there is an indication for discontinuation such as hyperkalemia or hypotension). There is no evidence that stopping ACE inhibitors or ARBs reduces the severity of COVID-19 [18-20]. This approach is supported by multiple guideline panels [21-25].There is speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes [26,27]. ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [28], and renin angiotensin system inhibitors may increase ACE2 levels [29-31]. In addition, patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes (a disorder with a high prevalence of renin angiotensin system inhibitors-treated use) often have a more severe clinical course in the setting of infection with SARS-CoV-2.However, there is no evidence to support an association between renin angiotensin system inhibitor use and more severe disease; some large studies indicate no relationship between the use of these agents and severity of COVID-19 [15,16,18-20], whereas other data suggest that these drugs may attenuate the severity of disease [32-35]. As examples: ●In a large cohort of 4357 infected hypertensive patients in New York City, rates of severe COVID-19 were the same among those taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB compared with those using a different antihypertensive drug (24.7 versus 25.3 percent) [15].●Similarly, among 3632 Italian patients with COVID-19 who were treated with antihypertensive medications, there was no association between ACE inhibitor or ARB use with severe illness (adjusted odds ratios 0.91 [95% CI 0.69-1.21] and 0.83 [95% CI 0.63-1.10], respectively) [16]. ●By contrast, in one large retrospective cohort of 1128 Chinese adults hospitalized with COVID-19, hypertensive patients taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB had a lower mortality at 28 days compared with those treated with alternative antihypertensive agents (adjusted hazard ratio 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.69) [34].In addition, studies conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that discontinuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs in some patients may exacerbate underlying cardiovascular or kidney disease and lead to increased mortality [36-38].Dialysis access planning in advanced CKD — Patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD who are referred for dialysis access placement should undergo these procedures as planned (and not have their planned procedure deferred). Although nonessential surgeries should be delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from the United States has clarified that placement of arteriovenous fistulas or grafts for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis catheters for peritoneal dialysis are essential procedures.INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES — Infection control practices specific to the care of patients with kidney disease requiring dialysis are presented in the preceding discussions.The general approach to infection control in the health care setting, in the home, and in non-hospital institutional settings, as well as the approach to discontinuation of COVID-19 precautions and return-to-work for health care personnel, are presented in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 due to the older age and high frequency of comorbidity, such as diabetes and hypertension, in this population. (See 'End-stage kidney disease' above.)●The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Society of Nephrology (ASN), and International Society of Nephrology (ISN) have issued interim guidelines and a list of resources to guide nephrology clinicians providing life-sustaining dialysis care. These resources, which continue to evolve and are frequently updated, include guidance about the following: early recognition and isolation of individuals with respiratory symptoms; patient separation and cohorting within waiting areas and within the dialysis unit; use of personal protective equipment in the dialysis unit; and additional measures for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See 'Early recognition/isolation of individuals with respiratory symptoms' above and 'Patient placement' above and 'Personal protective equipment' above and 'Additional measures for COVID-19' above.)●In general, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients receiving dialysis at home (ie, home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) should have their regular follow-up visits performed via telemedicine rather than via in-person, in-clinic visits. In addition, home visits by health care professionals should be minimized or stopped. Patients should have at least two weeks of dialysis supplies and sufficient medications in case they have to self-isolate, or in case there is a break in the supply chain. If an in-person visit is clinically indicated, appropriate infection control procedures for the outpatient unit should be followed, an attempt should be made to limit the number of patients seen per day, and non-essential procedures should be avoided. (See 'Patients receiving home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis' above.)●The American Society of Nephrology has issued guidelines for nephrology clinicians caring for hospitalized patients requiring dialysis for ESKD and acute kidney injury (AKI). These guidelines continue to evolve and are frequently updated. Although policies enforced at the level of the institution may vary, when possible, adherence to these guidelines is encouraged (see 'Hospitalized patients with ESKD' above and 'Patients with dialysis-requiring AKI' above):•Patients with COVID-19 should be co-localized on a floor or intensive care unit, when possible. Co-localization within adjacent rooms can enable one dialysis nurse to simultaneously deliver dialysis for more than one patient. If a patient is in a negative-pressure isolation room, then one hemodialysis nurse will need to be dedicated for the care of that patient in a 1:1 nurse-to-patient ratio.•When possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are not critically ill should be dialyzed in their own isolation room rather than being transported to the inpatient dialysis unit.•Where available, video and audio streams should be used to troubleshoot alarms from outside the room to minimize the need for the dialysis nurse or the nephrologist to enter an isolation room.•Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is preferred among critically ill patients in the intensive care unit who have ESKD or AKI.

ID:127537,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury,"INTRODUCTION — The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously referred to as 2019-nCoV). Patients with COVID-19 commonly present with signs of myocardial injury. This topic will discuss evaluation and management of these patients.Other cardiac issues in patients with COVID-19 are discussed separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)Other clinical aspects of COVID-19 are discussed separately: ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".) ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)DEFINITION AND ETIOLOGY — The term ""myocardial injury"" encompasses all conditions causing cardiomyocyte death. Myocardial injury is commonly clinically identified by the presence of at least one cardiac troponin value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), in accordance with the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI) [1]. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels are sensitive markers of myocardial injury; however, some patients with disease processes causing cardiomyocyte death may have troponin levels below the 99th percentile URL. Cardiac troponin elevation does not distinguish among the causes of myocardial injury. Putative causes of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 include myocarditis (which may have a pseudo-infarct presentation with normal coronary arteries) [2,3], hypoxic injury, stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, ischemic injury caused by cardiac microvascular damage or epicardial coronary artery disease (with plaque rupture or demand ischemia), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (cytokine storm) [4,5]. However, the contribution of each of these putative causes to myocardial injury in this setting has not been determined. It is also unknown whether angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2-related signaling pathways have a role in COVID-19-related cardiac injury. (See 'Troponin' below and ""Troponin testing: Clinical use"" and ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"" and ""Elevated cardiac troponin concentration in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome"" and ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy"".)Although some COVID-19 case reports have described findings consistent with a diagnosis of ""clinically suspected myocarditis"" [3] or possible stress cardiomyopathy [6-11], no case of biopsy- or autopsy-proven viral myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been reported thus far. A case report described a patient with COVID-19 with regional wall motion abnormalities and endomyocardial biopsy findings consistent with lymphocytic myocarditis, but molecular analysis showed absence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the myocardium [12]. A separate case report described a patient with COVID-19 who developed cardiogenic shock; light and electron microscopy of endomyocardial biopsy specimens revealed low-grade interstitial and endocardial inflammation, with viral particles identified in cytopathic macrophages but not in cardiomyocytes, which showed nonspecific features (eg, focal myofibrillar lysis and lipid droplets) [10]. These cases illustrate that identification of SARS-CoV-2 in specimens from the upper or lower respiratory tract is not sufficient to prove that myocardial injury was caused by SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis [6-8]. SARS-CoV-2 is not a known cardiotropic virus, and cardiotropic viruses that are known to be associated with myocarditis (eg, enterovirus, which is associated with diarrhea and parvovirus B19, which is associated with a pseudoinfarct presentation) were not searched for in most of the reported cases and might be involved. Proof that COVID-19 may be a new cause of viral myocarditis requires the presence of histological findings of active myocarditis (ie, inflammatory lymphomonocytic infiltrates plus myocyte necrosis not typical of ischemic injury) plus the identification of the COVID-19 genome in heart tissue and/or identification of viral particles in cardiomyocytes in the absence of known cardiotropic viruses [3]. Limited data are available on autopsy findings in patients dying from COVID-19. In case reports describing autopsy results for nine patients who died from COVID-19 (three patients in the Chongqing area [13], one patient in Beijing [14], two in Oklahoma [15], and three in New Orleans [16]), histologic examination of cardiac tissue did not show myocarditic changes. Troponin levels were not reported for six of these patients; two of the three New Orleans cases had elevated antemortem troponin levels (up to twice the upper reference limit), and one case had troponin levels within the reference range. ●In the Chongqing case series, histologic examination revealed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, degeneration and necrosis of some cardiomyocytes, and infiltration of a small number of cells that were mainly macrophages with a small number of CD4-positive T cells; there were no CD8-positive T cells or CD20-positive B cells [13]. Electron microscopy, immunohistochemical staining, and PCR revealed no SARS-CoV-2 in the myocardium.●In the New Orleans case series, all of the patients had cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, obesity, and gross examination revealed cardiomegaly and right ventricular dilation with no significant coronary artery stenosis or acute thrombus [16]. Histologic examination revealed scattered individual cardiomyocyte cell necrosis with no confluent areas of myocyte necrosis and rare areas with lymphocytes adjacent to but not surrounding degenerating myocytes. No viral cytopathic effect was identified by light microscopy, but studies for viral genome were not performed in this case series. Further investigation, including histologic examination of cardiac tissue in COVID-19 patients, is required to characterize the relationship between COVID-19 and myocardial injury. Since biopsy-proven myocarditis may occur in the absence of troponin release, autopsy studies of COVID-19 victims, regardless of troponin levels, would be helpful in clarifying whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is a new cause of viral myocarditis. PREVALENCE — Evidence of myocardial injury is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but the causes of myocardial injury have not been elucidated, and its contribution to incident heart failure has not been well characterized. Myocardial injury — The frequency of myocardial injury (as reflected by elevation in cardiac troponin levels) is variable among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with reported frequencies of 7 to 28 percent [2,17-19]. Some studies have identified greater frequency and magnitude of troponin elevations in hospitalized patients with more severe disease and worse outcomes [2,17,20-22]. Data are lacking on the frequency of troponin elevations in asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.In a series of 416 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, 19.7 percent had high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit on admission [2]. Patients with this marker of myocardial injury were older and had more comorbidities (including chronic heart failure in 14.6 versus 1.5 percent), greater laboratory abnormalities (including higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and aspartate aminotransferase), more lung radiographic abnormalities, and more complications compared with those without myocardial injury. The mortality rate was also higher in those with myocardial injury (51.2 versus 4.5 percent). The risk of death starting from the time of symptom onset was more than four times higher in patients with evidence of myocardial injury on admission (hazard ratio 4.26; 95% CI 1.92-9.49). In another study from Wuhan, elevation in hs-TnI above the 99th percentile upper reference limit was identified on admission in 46 percent of nonsurvivors versus 1 percent of survivors [21]. In contrast, a study of 24 critically ill COVID-19 patients in Seattle, with a 50 percent mortality rate, found elevated troponin levels early after intensive care unit admission in only 2 of 13 (15 percent) tested patients [19]. Some of the differences in frequency of troponin elevation may be due to use of differing troponin assays and differences in patient populations. Of note, only one study assessed and found considerably greater prevalence of preexisting cardiovascular disease and cardiac risk factors in patients with evidence of myocardial injury compared with those without elevated biomarkers [2]. Thus, it is not yet possible to determine whether myocardial injury is an independent risk marker in COVID-19 or if the risk associated with it is related to the burden of preexisting cardiovascular disease. Heart failure — Limited data are available on the incidence of heart failure in patients with COVID-19. In a retrospective study of 799 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, heart failure was identified as a complication in 49 percent of patients who died and in 3 percent of patients who recovered, despite a less than one percent baseline prevalence of chronic heart failure in the combined groups [23]. In a study of 191 patients hospitalized in two other medical centers in Wuhan, heart failure was identified in 52 percent of patients who died and in 12 percent of patients who recovered [21].Although the acute heart failure incidence was not documented in some series of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, elevated natriuretic peptides (such as brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] and N-terminal proBNP [NT-proBNP]) have been identified, particularly in patients with evidence of cardiac injury. In the above described series of 416 hospitalized patients, NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in patients with elevated troponin levels than in patients without troponin elevation (1689 versus 139 pg/mL) [2]. (See 'Myocardial injury' above.)Heart failure in patients with COVID-19 may be precipitated by acute illness in patients with pre-existing known or undiagnosed heart disease (eg, coronary artery disease or hypertensive heart disease) or incident acute myocardial injury (eg, acute MI, stress cardiomyopathy, cytokine storm, and other possible etiologies described above). Cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For example, in a report of 191 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, comorbidities included hypertension in 30 percent, diabetes mellitus in 19 percent, and coronary heart disease in 8 percent [21]. Patients with a known history of heart failure may suffer an acute decompensation due to the development of COVID-19 disease [9]. CLINICAL FEATURESClinical presentation — Most patients with COVID-19 with evidence of myocardial injury present with the typical symptoms and signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, as described separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)A minority of patients with COVID-19 with evidence of myocardial injury present with cardiac symptoms (such as chest pain or palpitations [24]) or more nonspecific symptoms (fatigue); these symptoms may or may not be accompanied by prior or concurrent symptoms of respiratory infection [4,25]. Initial testsLaboratory tests — Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count with differential, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and blood glucose. (See ""Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure"", section on 'Initial panels'.)ECG — A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is generally performed in patients presenting for acute care with suspected symptomatic COVID-19. This enables documentation of baseline QRS-T morphology should the patient develop symptoms or signs of a type of myocardial injury such as an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the baseline ECG allows for documentation of the QT (and corrected QTc) interval. Importantly, QTc will need to be monitored if QT-prolonging therapies are initiated (eg, azithromycin, chloroquine) to reduce the risk of acquired long QT syndrome. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'ECG' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' and ""Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"".)ECG abnormalities that have been reported in patients with COVID-19 and troponin elevation include T-wave depression and inversion, ST-segment elevation or depression, and Q waves [2,6,8,26]. When ST-segment elevation is present, diagnostic evaluation is required to distinguish MI from other causes of myocardial injury [6,8,26] (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"", section on 'ST-elevation myocardial infarction'.)In a case series of 18 patients with COVID-19 with ST-segment elevation, MI was clinically diagnosed in eight (of which six underwent coronary angiography that confirmed obstructive coronary disease), with the remaining 10 diagnosed with noncoronary myocardial injury [26]. Four of the patients with MI and nine of the patients with noncoronary myocardial injury died in hospital.The most common arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 is sinus tachycardia but atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ventricular tachycardia may occur. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)Troponin — Troponin testing is commonly performed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as it may have prognostic value and may serve as a useful baseline for comparison in patients who develop manifestations of possible myocardial injury (such as heart failure or arrhythmia). Some experts also perform troponin testing in selected outpatients with uncertain level of risk. As mentioned above, among patients with COVID-19, troponin levels are most prevalent and most elevated with more severe disease [18,27]. An elevated troponin is likely not indicative of an acute coronary syndrome in the absence of suggestive symptoms, signs, or ECG findings. Although troponin elevation is typically higher in patients with acute coronary syndrome than in patients with noncoronary myocardial injury, troponin levels in these clinical settings are overlapping [26,28]. The evaluation of COVID-19 patients for acute coronary syndrome is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"", section on 'Acute coronary syndrome patients'.)In patients with COVID-19, troponin elevation may be initially detected prior to, at the time of, or following hospital admission [6-9,18,21,22,29]. A variety of time courses for troponin elevation have been observed:●Mild – Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 commonly have mild troponin elevation (typically <99th percentile upper reference limit), with modest rise or fall on subsequent days, typically remaining well below the 99th percentile upper reference limit [18]. This appears to be the most common pattern of troponin elevation in patients with COVID-19 and is often associated with no cardiac symptoms. This pattern has been described in patients with COVID-19 who survived after hospitalization [21]. ●Moderate time-limited – Early moderate troponin elevation (which may approach or exceed the 99th percentile upper reference limit), which may fall on subsequent days. This pattern was seen in anecdotal reports of patients with clinically suspected myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy [6-9].●Progressive – Some patients with moderate troponin elevation at hospital admission suffer clinical deterioration with respiratory failure accompanied by progressive troponin elevation, along with elevations in other biomarkers (eg, D-dimer, interleukin-6, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase) with accelerated rise after the second week of hospitalization [21,22]. This progression to cytokine storm has been described in nonsurvivors, with death occurring at a median of 18.5 days after symptom onset [21]. Natriuretic peptide — A natriuretic peptide level (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal proBNP) is obtained in patients with suspected heart failure if the diagnosis of heart failure is uncertain. (See ""Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure"", section on 'BNP and NT-proBNP'.)As described above, natriuretic peptide levels are commonly elevated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in patients with elevated cardiac troponin levels. (See 'Heart failure' above.)DIAGNOSISWhen to suspect myocardial injury and key considerations — Myocardial injury should be suspected in patients with COVID-19 with one or more of the following new findings: troponin elevation, global or regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, unexplained cardiac arrhythmias, or ECG changes (particularly diffuse ST elevation).Diagnostic evaluationKey considerations — The approach to evaluation of myocardial injury in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 may differ from the standard approach to evaluation of myocarditis, as it is based upon weighing the following considerations [27]: ●The likelihood that evaluation will change management. Thus, it is important to identify a treatable cause of myocardial injury that requires timely intervention, such as acute myocardial infarction. ●Considerations of nosocomial infection control to limit the spread of disease.●Optimal management of limited available medical staff and resources to provide for the health care needs of the community.Diagnostic approach — The diagnostic evaluation includes the following components (see ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Approach to diagnosis of myocarditis'):●Clinical evaluation includes history, physical examination, ECG, serum cardiac troponin levels, and initial laboratory tests to assess for symptoms and signs of heart failure and possible causes (including conditions unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection). Natriuretic peptide (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal proBNP) measurement is indicated if the diagnosis of heart failure is uncertain. (See 'Initial tests' above.)●Decisions regarding the need for further evaluation are based upon whether test results will alter clinical management. •If the clinical presentation is suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS; including MI or unstable angina) based upon the presence of chest pain, other anginal symptoms, new heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, and/or new ischemic ECG changes, timely evaluation is required to determine if urgent intervention is indicated and to institute appropriate therapies. There is an elevated risk of ACS among patients with COVID-19 given the high prevalence of comorbidities in this patient population. Evaluation of coronary disease in patients with COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"" and ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'When to suspect acute MI'.)•For patients with COVID-19 without suspected ACS, further testing is limited since specific diagnostic tests and treatments are not available for most of the noncoronary causes of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients:-Most patients with mild troponin elevation without symptoms and signs of acute heart failure can be clinically monitored without cardiac imaging.-For patients who develop new onset heart failure, echocardiogram may be performed to evaluate regional and global ventricular and valvular function if this is requested by a consulting cardiologist and is expected to have a significant impact on management or is likely to change the patient's prognosis. Echocardiography findings that have been described in case reports of patients with COVID-19 include focal and global left ventricular wall motion abnormalities and pericardial effusion. ●For patients with a ventricular motion abnormality, elevated troponin, and no ACS, possible diagnoses include stress cardiomyopathy and clinically suspected myocarditis (along with other causes of myocardial injury described above). (See 'Myocardial injury' above.)•A diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy is based on identification of the following four features: transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction (typically not in a single coronary distribution; patterns include apical, mid-ventricular, and basal), absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary disease or acute plaque rupture; presence of new ECG abnormalities (either ST-segment elevation and/or T-wave inversion); or modest elevation in cardiac troponin and absence of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis. Although patients with stress cardiomyopathy are at risk for the development of acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock, those who survive the acute episode typically recover ventricular function within one to four weeks. Thus, a clinical diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy may aid in evaluating prognosis. The diagnosis, prognosis, and management of stress cardiomyopathy are discussed separately. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy"" and ""Management and prognosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy"".)•In patients with COVID-19 with suspected myocarditis, the decision on whether to proceed with further evaluation for myocarditis (with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [CMR] and possible endomyocardial biopsy) is based on the likelihood of a diagnosis that would alter therapy. Care must be taken to balance the risk of potential nosocomial spread of the disease and benefit of this additional information to modifying treatment. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)-Since there is no established therapy for clinically suspected myocarditis, we do not recommend routine evaluation for myocarditis in patients with COVID-19. Although case reports have described empiric immunotherapy in a few patients with COVID-19 with clinically suspected myocarditis (with or without CMR confirmation), the safety and efficacy of such therapy are uncertain. -Evaluation for myocarditis by endomyocardial biopsy (with or without prior CMR, depending on the patient's condition and available resources) may be appropriate in selected cases when a treatable type of myocarditis is suspected (eg, giant cell myocarditis), or in the presence of severe unexplained biventricular dysfunction, unexplained cardiogenic shock, or unexplained life-threatening arrhythmia with normal coronary arteries (with or without troponin increase) to confirm a definitive diagnosis of myocarditis and identify its cause to enable possible etiology-directed therapy [3]. Since biopsy-proven myocarditis is highly prevalent in young patients and very rare in the elderly, the clinical suspicion of myocarditis should be higher, and the threshold to perform an endomyocardial biopsy should be lower in young patients without cardiovascular comorbidities. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Approach to diagnosis of myocarditis' and ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Management of specific disorders'.)DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — Evaluation of the possible acute coronary and noncoronary causes of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 is described above. (See 'Diagnostic approach' above and 'Definition and etiology' above.)The differential diagnosis of acute myocardial injury includes chronic troponin elevation, which at low levels may not reflect risk of cardiac disease. With the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays, most healthy individuals have small but detectable levels of troponins in their blood. Therefore, myocardial injury is identified as a troponin elevation above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit, but this threshold varies among different patient populations. Troponin elevations have been identified in patients with high cardiovascular risk without an identified cardiovascular event, and troponin elevations are commonly persistent in patients with kidney disease. (See ""Elevated cardiac troponin concentration in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome"".)Troponin elevations are infrequently analytic false positive results. (See ""Troponin testing: Analytical considerations"", section on 'Assay false positives and false negatives'.)MANAGEMENTGeneral approachSupportive cardiac care — The optimal management for myocardial injury associated with COVID-19 has not been determined. Thus, the management of patients with myocardial injury, including clinically suspected myocarditis, involves supportive care (including management of heart failure, therapy for arrhythmias, and avoidance of cardiotoxins), as discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Management' and ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'General management' and ""Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"" and ""Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy"" and ""Overview of the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adults"" and ""Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"" and ""Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction"".)Patients with COVID-19 and heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction should receive standard therapy for these conditions including pharmacologic therapy, careful management of fluid balance, and advanced therapies as needed. (See ""Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"" and ""Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy"" and ""Overview of the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adults"" and ""Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"" and ""Management of refractory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction"" and ""Management and prognosis of asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction"".) General management including thromboprophylaxis — General management of COVID-19 and critical care issues are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Hypercoagulability and the role of thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)Investigational — While laboratory evidence of a marked inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome, is associated with critical and fatal illness in patients with COVID-19, no treatment has been identified for this syndrome. Investigational protocols using the interleukin-6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab are ongoing. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Management of specific disorders' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)ACE inhibitors and ARBs — Of note, standard indications for an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (and for the latter two drugs in treatment of hypertension) apply to patients with COVID-19. Although there has been speculation that elevated ACE2 levels caused by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors might impact susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 because ACE2 is a receptor for this virus, there is no evidence that treatment with these drugs worsens the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)Issues for ventricular assist devices and cardiac transplantation — Patients supported by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) may present with low-flow alarms due to the vasodilation coupled with diarrhea and dehydration, which can occur with COVID-19 infection. However, vigorous fluid resuscitation can result in right heart failure in these LVAD patients. (See ""Practical management of long-term mechanical circulatory support devices"", section on 'Right heart failure' and ""Right heart failure: Causes and management"".)Whether maintenance immunosuppression for cardiac transplant recipients should be altered and whether these patients have more or less severe COVID-19 is unknown. There has been some suggestion that the late stage of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome may be alleviated by the presence of immunosuppression, as it may reduce the cytokine response. Many heart transplant centers have reduced antiproliferative agents (eg, mycophenolate mofetil) in patients with COVID-19 infection [9,18]; generally, calcineurin inhibitors and prednisone doses have been maintained in this setting. (See ""Heart transplantation in adults: Induction and maintenance of immunosuppressive therapy"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●The term ""myocardial injury"" encompasses all conditions causing cardiomyocyte death. Myocardial injury is commonly clinically identified by the presence of at least one cardiac troponin value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL). High-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels are sensitive markers of myocardial injury; however, some patients with disease processes causing cardiomyocyte death may have troponin levels below the 99th percentile URL. (See 'Definition and etiology' above.)●Putative causes of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 include myocarditis, hypoxic injury, stress cardiomyopathy, ischemic injury caused by cardiac microvascular damage or epicardial coronary artery disease (with plaque rupture or demand ischemia), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (cytokine storm). However, the contribution of each of these putative causes to myocardial injury in this setting has not been determined. Thus far, no case of biopsy- or autopsy-proven viral myocarditis caused by COVID-19 has been reported; further investigation, including histologic examination of cardiac tissue from COVID-19 patients with the identification of findings of active myocarditis plus COVID-19 genome in heart tissue and/or identification of viral particles in cardiomyocytes in the absence of known cardiotropic viruses, is required to prove that COVID-19 is a novel cause of viral myocarditis. (See 'Definition and etiology' above.)●Myocardial injury (as reflected in elevated cardiac troponin levels) is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but the causes of myocardial injury have not been elucidated, and its contribution to incident heart failure has not been well characterized. Greater frequency and magnitude of troponin elevations are associated with more severe disease and worse outcomes. (See 'Myocardial injury' above.)●Incident heart failure may be common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Heart failure in patients with COVID-19 may be precipitated by acute illness in patients with preexisting known or undiagnosed heart disease (eg, coronary artery disease or hypertensive heart disease) or incident acute myocardial injury (eg, acute myocardial infarction, stress cardiomyopathy, and other possible etiologies described above). (See 'Heart failure' above.)●Most patients with COVID-19 with evidence of myocardial injury present with the typical symptoms and signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. A minority of patients with COVID-19 with evidence of myocardial injury present with cardiac symptoms (such as chest pain or palpitations). (See 'Clinical presentation' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●Patterns of troponin elevation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 include mild limited elevation (the most common pattern), a moderate time-limited elevation (which may approach or exceed the 99th percentile upper reference limit), and a progressive pattern with moderate elevation followed by a progressive elevation along with rise of other biomarkers consistent with cytokine storm. (See 'Troponin' above.)●If the clinical presentation is suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), timely evaluation is required to determine if urgent intervention is indicated. Evaluation of coronary disease in patients with COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See 'Diagnosis' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)●Most patients with COVID-19 without suspected ACS, with mild troponin elevation, and without acute heart failure can be clinically monitored without cardiac imaging. For patients who develop new onset heart failure, echocardiogram may be performed to evaluate regional and global ventricular and valvular function if this is requested by a consulting cardiologist and is expected to have a significant impact on management or is likely to change the patient's prognosis. (See 'Diagnosis' above.)●Since there is no established therapy for clinically suspected myocarditis, we do not recommend routine evaluation for myocarditis in patients with COVID-19. Evaluation for myocarditis by endomyocardial biopsy (with or without prior cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, depending on the patient's condition and available resources) may be appropriate in selected cases when a treatable type of myocarditis is suspected (eg, giant cell myocarditis) or in the presence of severe unexplained biventricular dysfunction, unexplained cardiogenic shock, or unexplained life-threatening arrhythmia with normal coronary arteries (with or without troponin increase) to confirm a definitive diagnosis of myocarditis and identify its cause to enable possible etiology-directed therapy. Since biopsy-proven myocarditis is highly prevalent in young patients and very rare in the elderly, the clinical suspicion of myocarditis should be higher, and the threshold to perform an endomyocardial biopsy should be lower in young patients without cardiovascular comorbidities.

The key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. We sought to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique. It was found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19. There was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1β+ monocytes in the ERS. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the naïve B cells decreased. Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development were confirmed. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1β and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.",2020-05-04 00:00:00,NATURE,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Several studies report outcomes of COVID-19 in predominately well persons. There are also some data on COVID-19 in persons with predominately solid cancer but controversy whether these persons have the same outcomes. We conducted a cohort study at two centres in Wuhan, China, of 128 hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers, 13 (10%) of whom developed COVID-19. We also studied 226 health care providers, 16 of whom developed COVID-19 and 11 of whom were hospitalised. Co-variates were compared with the 115 subjects with haematological cancers without COVID-19 and with 11 hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. There were no significant differences in baseline co-variates between subjects with haematological cancers developing or not developing COVID-19. Case rates for COVID-19 in hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers was 10% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 6, 17%) compared with 7% (4, 12%; P = 0.322) in health care providers. However, the 13 subjects with haematological cancers had more severe COVID-19 and more deaths compared with hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. Case fatality rates were 62% (32, 85%) and 0 (0, 32%; P = 0.002). Hospitalised persons with haematological cancers have a similar case rate of COVID-19 compared with normal health care providers but have more severe disease and a higher case fatality rate. Because we were unable to identify specific risk factors for COVID-19 in hospitalised persons with haematological cancers, we suggest increased surveillance and possible protective isolation.",2020-04-24 00:00:00,NATURE,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Macrophages are a population of innate immune cells that sense and respond to microbial threats by producing inflammatory molecules that eliminate pathogens and promote tissue repair. However, a dysregulated macrophage response can be damaging to the host, as is seen in the macrophage activation syndrome induced by severe infections, including in infections with the related virus SARS-CoV.

Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells. Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present. Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.",2020-04-27 00:00:00,NATURE,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-04-22 00:00:00,NATURE,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Responses from those questions shared between the surveys were pooled then analyzed; four questions’ responses (those not shared) were analyzed separately.ResultsA total of 783 responses were submitted from six continents. Few participants (5.8%) had tested their outpatients with SCI/D for COVID-19; only 4.4% reported having a patient with SCI/D with the virus. Of respondents who worked at an inpatient facility, 53.3% reported that only individuals with symptoms were being screened and 29.9% said that no screening was occurring. Participants relayed several concerns offered by their patients with SCI/D, including vulnerability to infection (76.9%) and fragility of caretaker supply (42%), and those living in countries with guaranteed health care were more likely to report widespread availability of COVID-19 testing than were those living in countries without universal care, χ2 (3, N = 625) = 46.259, p < 0.001.ConclusionThere is substantial variability in the rehabilitation medicine community in COVID-19 screening practices and availability of screening kits.

No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered. All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2–3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens.

His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy.DiscussionBlood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients.

As of April 16, 2020, the confirmed case count of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had surpassed 2 million.

Here we show the establishment and characterization of expandable intestinal organoids derived from horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus sinicus species that can recapitulate bat intestinal epithelium. These bat enteroids are fully susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and sustain robust viral replication. Development of gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients with COVID-19 and detection of viral RNA in fecal specimens suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might cause enteric, in addition to respiratory, infection3,4. Here we demonstrate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal organoids and isolation of infectious virus from the stool specimen of a patient with diarrheal COVID-19. Collectively, we established the first expandable organoid culture system of bat intestinal epithelium and present evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect bat intestinal cells.

Some experts attribute this sequence of events to a large increase in cytokines (cytokine storm) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or a secondary infection by another organism. Objective: To report cytokine levels in multiple body fluids from a patient with COVID-19 and ARDS, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Case Report: On 20 January 2020, a 66-year-old man who had been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 developed cough and fever and treated himself at home. On 2 February, his cough and fever gradually worsened, his body temperature reached 38.7 °C, and he developed diarrhea and vomiting. He was treated at a local hospital, where his medical history included vitiligo, gastric ulcer, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He developed dyspnea 2 days later, and COVID-19 was diagnosed by a throat swab that was tested for nucleic acid. He received the antiviral drug abidol and supportive care. When his dyspnea worsened, he was transferred to the intensive care unit for noninvasive mechanical ventilation. On 11 February, mechanical ventilation was started because of a progressive decrease in blood oxygen saturation, a blood lactate level of 4 mmol/L, and a PaO2–FiO2 ratio of 186 mm Hg. On 17 February, the patient was transferred to the Severe COVID-19 Intensive Treatment Center of Heilongjiang Province. His COVID-19 status was confirmed as a critical type, according to guidelines from the National Health Commission (trial version 7). We treated him with antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin infusions, lung-protective ventilation, and lung recruitment and prone position ventilation. In addition, we started measuring levels of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in his blood daily and in his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pleural fluid intermittently, and we found high levels (Figure). On 23 February, we started continuous renal replacement therapy with an Oxiris filter (Baxter International), which is designed to adsorb uremic toxins, endotoxin, and cytokines. Computed tomography on 24 February showed worsening of pulmonary inflammation. On 1 March, we started extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because we could not                     maintain the patient's oxygenation with intermittent prone position ventilation. On 2 March, the patient developed septic shock and cardiac insufficiency, and we introduced an intra-aortic balloon pump. On 6 March, every-other-day plasmapheresis was started in another attempt to decrease his cytokine levels. Computed tomography on 9 March showed that the patient's lung consolidation had worsened. Unfortunately, the patient died on 14 March. ",2020-05-12 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
DOI:10.7326/M20-1550,10.7326/M20-1550,Letters,Pharmacokinetics of Lopinavir and Ritonavir in Patients Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread around the world, and the lack of effective treatment has fueled a global search for the “magic bullet” against the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 29 April 2020, a total of 997 COVID-19 trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, of which more than 30 are investigating the effects of lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir is the main antiviral agent, whereas ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic “booster” that increases lopinavir plasma concentrations by inhibiting cytochrome 3A4 enzymes (1). The combination is an approved antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV-1 infection. However, in vitro data also suggest antiviral activity of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-1, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 4.1 µg/mL; Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, with an EC50 of 10.8 µg/mL; and, only recently, SARS-CoV-2, with an EC50 of 16.4 µg/mL (2). Importantly, the EC50 for HIV-1 is 0.07 µg/mL, more than 200-fold lower than for SARS-CoV-2 (1). Recently, Cao and colleagues published negative results of a placebo-controlled trial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in which lopinavir treatment did not affect mortality, clinical performance, or viral                     loads (3). Objective: To measure trough levels of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with COVID-19. Methods and Findings: In this series of 8 patients who were admitted to a “normal care” ward because of COVID-19, we quantified trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Patients with concomitant intake of relevant CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors were excluded. Patients were hospitalized and received 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily for 3 to 10 days before analysis, which was done in the morning shortly before the next dose. Assuming a half-life of 4 to 6 hours for lopinavir, steady-state conditions may be assumed for all patients. Analysis of trough levels was chosen because they provide more robust pharmacokinetic information for single time–point assessments and were frequently investigated in HIV trials, which makes the data comparable. Trough concentrations of lopinavir ranged from 6.2 to 24.3 µg/mL (median, 13.6 µg/mL) (Table). Interestingly, in this small sample, trough concentrations seemed to be associated with C-reactive protein (Spearman correlation coefficient rS = 0.81). All patients had an unremarkable disease course and were discharged from the normal care ward. Specific adverse effects of lopinavir and ritonavir were not observed.",2020-05-12 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

DOI:10.7326/M20-1941,10.7326/M20-1941,Ideas and Opinions,Sex and Gender Differences in Health: What the COVID-19 Pandemic Can Teach Us,"Sex; biological and physiologic traits characterizing males and females; and gender, a continuum of socioculturally constructed roles and behaviors associated with men, women, and gender-spectrum diversity, are among the most important determinants of health and disease outcomes. However, these fundamental factors are often ignored in biomedical research and are rarely incorporated into clinical care. We call for sex- and gender-specific and differentiating factors to be urgently included in the research, prevention, and therapeutics implementation response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although available sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between sexes, current evidence indicates that fatality rates are higher in men than in women. A recent report (23 April 2020) from the Italian National Institute of Health shows that of 23 188 deaths from COVID-19 infection in Italy, approximately 70% were in men. In the United States, provisional death counts for COVID-19 from February to April 2020 similarly indicate a sex bias in fatality rates: Of 37 308 deaths reported by the National Center for Health Statistics, 59% were in men. Similar trends have been reported in China (1) and South Korea (2). Taken together, these preliminary data suggest that sex- and gender-related factors may be implicated in COVID-19 vulnerability. As scientists, we may consider this an interesting observation to be explored in post hoc analyses, using available sex and gender data. Or we can investigate a priori the specific role of these factors and potentially leverage the mechanisms implicated in sex and gender differences in COVID-19 risk, progression, and outcomes, to identify effective prevention and treatment interventions for the entire population. Adopting a sex- and gender-informed perspective in research has already shown to improve patient care for cardiovascular diseases and other conditions that affect both women and men (3). Translating this perspective to the study of COVID-19 infection requires the first and essential step of collecting large-scale sex- and gender-disaggregated data. This task may pose some methodological challenges for gender, given the lack of validated tools to assess gender. Using sex when reporting biological factors and gender when reporting gender identity or sociocultural factors, and asking individuals about both their sex assigned at birth and their current gender identity, may facilitate data collection and improve comparability across studies. However, truly sex- and gender-informed research exceeds mere stratification by these variables. Researchers should also systematically assess biological (such as hormonal state, immune function, comorbid conditions, and concurrent treatments) and gender-related (such as lifestyle and socioeconomic status) factors in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, as clinical trials investigating novel therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection are being launched worldwide, it is imperative to incorporate sex- and gender-related data into these trials and to analyze and report treatment outcomes disaggregated by sex and gender.",2020-05-08 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
DOI:10.7326/M20-2004,10.7326/M20-2004,Ideas and Opinions,Sexual Health in the SARS-CoV-2 Era,"More than 200 000 people have died of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, leading to widespread concern regarding physical morbidity and mortality. The sexual health implications, however, have received little focus. On the basis of existing data, it appears all forms of in-person sexual contact carry risk for viral transmission, because the virus is readily transmitted by aerosols and fomites. This has resulted in broad guidance regarding physical distancing, with substantial implications for sexual well-being. Given the important role of sexuality in most people's lives, health care providers (HCPs) should consider counseling patients on this topic whenever possible. This is an unprecedented and stressful time for HCPs; facilitating brief conversations and referrals to relevant resources (Table) can help patients maintain sexual wellness amid the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is present in respiratory secretions and spreads through aerosolized particles (1). It may remain stable on surfaces for days (1). On the basis of this information, all types of in-person sexual activity probably carry risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Infected individuals have the potential to spread respiratory secretions onto their skin and personal objects, from which the virus can be transmitted to a sexual partner. Because many SARS-CoV-2–infected people are asymptomatic, HCPs are left with little to offer beyond guidance to not engage in any in-person sexual activity. Data are lacking regarding other routes of sexual transmission. Two small studies of SARS-CoV-2–infected people did not detect virus in semen or vaginal secretions (2, 3). An additional study of semen samples from 38 patients detected the virus by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 6 patients (15.8%) (4). However, the relevance regarding sexual transmission remains unknown. Until this is better understood, it would be prudent to consider semen potentially infectious. Although 1 study failed to detect the virus in urine samples (5), there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids were detected in a urine sample in at least 1 patient in another study (6). Until this is clarified, urine should also be considered potentially                 infectious. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool samples, raising concern for fecal–oral transmission (7). It is not clear, however, whether viral RNA detected in stool is capable of causing productive infection. Moreover, these data are moot, given that any in-person contact results in substantial risk for disease transmission owing to the virus' stability on common surfaces and propensity to propagate in the oropharynx and respiratory tract. Sexual expression is a central aspect of human health but is often neglected by HCPs. Messaging around sex being dangerous may have insidious psychological effects at a time when people are especially susceptible to mental health difficulties. Some groups, including sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities, may be particularly vulnerable to sexual stigma, given the historical trauma of other pandemics, such as AIDS. Abstinence recommendations may conjure memories of the widespread stigmatization of SGM people during the AIDS crisis. For the population at large, a recommendation of long-term sexual abstinence is unlikely to be effective, given the well-documented failures of abstinence-based public health interventions and their likelihood to promote shame (8). A range of sexual practices organized from least to most risky is shown in the Table. Abstinence is the lowest-risk approach to sexual health during the pandemic. Masturbation is an additional safe recommendation for patients to meet their sexual needs without the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2020-05-08 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
DOI:10.7326/M20-2071,10.7326/M20-2071,Ideas and Opinions,The Urge to Build More Intensive Care Unit Beds and Ventilators: Intuitive but Errant,"Throughout the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, much attention has been devoted to the fraught question of how to allocate intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators if the supply of these resources is insufficient to provide them to all patients considered to be in need. Contemplating such tragic choices naturally conjures thoughts that we might have avoided these dilemmas by rapidly manufacturing new beds and ventilators at the first sign of a looming pandemic, or by rapidly converting existing beds and machines such that they could be used to expand the supply of critical care resources. These ideas stem from the natural human heuristic and conventional clinical ethos to mount unstinting effort toward saving the lives of those who fall ill. These views are also psychologically reinforced by the instinct to deploy aggressive medical technology to win the “war” against the pandemic. Indeed, the instinct to save the lives of the desperately ill, which exemplifies the “rule of rescue” (1), is so intuitively powerful as to make it hard for humans to even consider competing approaches. No one would condone a response to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not include using the nation's full supply of critical care resources. However, the drive to build even more beds and ventilators will do more to assuage public anxiety and outrage than to reduce overall mortality, owing to both the poor outcomes among patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation and the diversion of clinical workforces. We argue that supply-side investments in critical care in the midst of the pandemic would not substantially improve population health in the short term and would worsen it in the long term. As psychologically disruptive as it may be to consider not expanding the critical care supply, such expansions would magnify the already considerable skew of U.S. health care toward intensive care. We further argue that even modest improvements in public health measures, such as physical distancing (which might be promoted by infomercials featuring sports or movie stars) and training more health care workers to become expert in serious illness communication, would be more effective than investments in critical care for improving short-term population health. Before COVID-19, the United States had more ICU beds and ventilators per capita than nearly any other country (2). Indeed, an assessment of ICU occupancy and ventilator use revealed that during noncrisis times, the United States has a glut of critical care resources. In any given hour, only two thirds of ICU beds are occupied and only one third are occupied by patients receiving mechanical ventilation (3). Although these numbers have been starkly different during the COVID-19 crisis, they highlight our substantial existing capacity to care for those most likely to benefit from critical care. As a result of this extant capacity, adding ventilators and ICU beds would make critical care delivery less efficient. Indeed, many studies have shown that when ICU beds are tight, critical care is increasingly allocated to patients who benefit from it, without increasing overall mortality (4–6). Building more beds and ventilators would offset these efficiencies of scarcity, increasing the already high mortality rates observed among patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation (7). Although the total number of survivors might increase to an extent, so too would the burden of chronic critical illness.",2020-05-07 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
DOI:10.7326/M20-2076,10.7326/M20-2076,History of Medicine,Biomedical Research in Times of Emergency: Lessons From History,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has sickened millions, killed hundreds of thousands, and utterly disrupted the daily lives of billions of people around the world. In an effort to ameliorate this devastation, the biomedical research complex has allocated billions of dollars and scientists have initiated hundreds of clinical trials in an expedited effort to understand, prevent, and treat this disease. National emergencies can stimulate significant investment of financial, physical, and intellectual resources that catalyze impressive scientific accomplishments, as evident with the Manhattan Project, penicillin, and the polio vaccines in the 20th century. However, pressurized research has also led to false promises, disastrous consequences, and breaches in ethics. Antiserum in the 1918 flu epidemic, contaminated yellow fever vaccines in World War II, and unethical human experimentation with mustard gas offer just a few cautionary exemplars. It is critical to continue biomedical research efforts to address this pandemic, and it is appropriate that they receive priority in both attention and funding. But history also demonstrates the importance of treating early results—such as those associated with hydroxychloroquine—with caution as we only begin to understand the biology, epidemiology, and potential target points of COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has incited remarkable disruption in biomedical research. At academic institutions worldwide, laboratories have been forced to halt all but the most critical activities. Clinical trials of novel agents for such diseases as cancer are temporarily suspended, limiting access to potentially life-prolonging medications. Meanwhile, public health and biomedical research directed at understanding and intervening on the pandemic has been initiated with impressive rapidity. Although this boom has already begun to transform our response to the pandemic for the better, medical and scientific responses to past crises suggest that urgency may also result in compromised research quality and ethics, which may in turn jeopardize public faith in government and science, waste precious resources, and lead to the loss of human life. As of 2 May 2020, ClinicalTrials.gov had indexed 681 interventional trials testing potential therapies for COVID-19; another 437 observational studies were listed. In the United States, the National Institutes of Health have assumed a leadership role in funding COVID-19 research by offering billions of dollars in newly apportioned grant funds (1). International consortia have assembled to study the pandemic and evaluate potential therapies, and elite medical journals have committed to evaluating manuscripts rapidly and to sharing data with regulatory bodies (2, 3). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued several new guidelines to facilitate these investigations, such as recommendations enabling the simultaneous production of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) testing in commercial laboratories nationwide and guidance regarding the development of convalescent plasma as a potential treatment for the viral illness (4, 5). Given previous responses to national emergencies, which have catalyzed multiple medical and scientific advances, this widespread galvanization of pandemic-directed research is unsurprising (6). Perhaps most famously, the exigencies of World War II led to the Manhattan Project, which marshaled billions of dollars and thousands of scientists to expedite the construction of nuclear weapons. A comparable effort during World War II supported the mass production and widespread availability of penicillin. The same variables that propel medical innovation during wartime are also present in global pandemics. The polio crises of the 1950s commanded such public attention in the United States that efforts to create and evaluate a vaccine were funded by the federal government, which funded less than half of all biomedical research at the time, and were promoted by such cultural icons as baseball star Joe DiMaggio and comedian Lucille Ball (7, 8). In all of these examples, the immediate need for an intervention combined with an enormous influx of resources to hasten the research and development process. Yet, pressurized research agendas present their own challenges. Urgency can induce shortcuts that compromise quality. When all investigations focus on a single topic, researchers may be required to work in areas in which they lack expertise. During World War II, scientists were desperate to mass-produce yellow fever vaccines to protect millions of service members crisscrossing the globe to areas rife with the disease. Relying on untested human serum, they unknowingly used a contaminated sample to formulate the vaccines and infected tens of thousands of GIs with hepatitis (9).",2020-05-07 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
DOI:10.7326/M20-2189,10.7326/M20-2189,Ideas and Opinions,Treatment of Community-Acquired Pneumonia During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,"The rapidly escalating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has focused attention on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute respiratory infection in an unprecedented manner. Although most of the lung injury patients have is believed to be caused by the virus, concern over bacterial co-infection also informs current treatment approaches for patients with COVID-19–related pneumonia. As the cochairs of the recently released American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America Guideline for Treatment of Adults with Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) (1), we offer our interpretation of the guideline as it applies to the management of patients with COVID-19 (Table). 1. Empirical coverage for bacterial pathogens is recommended in patients with CAP without confirmed COVID-19 but is not required in all patients with confirmed COVID-19–related pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed in patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection (especially cough, sputum production, and fever) and radiographic evidence of lung involvement. The cause of CAP includes a range of bacteria and viruses, and with the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, viruses are an increasingly frequent cause (2). Despite this trend, the new guideline continues to emphasize prompt antibacterial drug therapy for all patients diagnosed with CAP. Antibacterial therapy continues to be featured so prominently in CAP guidelines because before the COVID-19 pandemic, bacterial causes of CAP were associated with the highest mortality and empirical antibacterial therapy is proven to be effective and save lives. Unfortunately, the classic microbiological diagnostic tests for CAP, sputum and blood cultures, fail to reveal a definitive pathogen in many cases (3), and although the identification of a specific pathogen can help narrow treatment decisions, the delay in obtaining a result leads to the need for initial empirical coverage, which is active against the common bacterial pathogens. Recent studies have highlighted that findings of pulmonary involvement on chest imaging in patients with confirmed COVID-19 are common, including lobar consolidation, ground glass opacities, and reticular infiltrates (4). One series estimated that 59% of hospitalized patients have abnormalities on initial chest radiography, which is consistent with pneumonia, and 86% have abnormalities on chest computed tomography (5). A largely untested hypothesis is that most of these patients with radiographic abnormalities likely have isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the lung without any additional pathogen. However, a recent case series reported that serologic evidence of co-infection with bacterial pathogens (including chlamydia) was not uncommon among fatal cases of COVID-19 pneumonia (6).",2020-05-07 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
DOI:10.7326/M20-2003,10.7326/M20-2003,Original Research,Autopsy Findings and Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With COVID-19: A Prospective Cohort Study,"Since it was first detected in December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS–CoV-2) spread from the central Chinese province of Hubei to almost every country in the world (1, 2). Most persons with COVID-19 have a mild disease course, but about 20% develop a more severe course with a high mortality rate (3). As of 26 April 2020, more than 2.9 million persons have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and 210 000 of them have died (4). Why the new coronavirus seems to have a much higher mortality rate than the seasonal flu is not completely understood. Some authors have reported potential risk factors for a more severe disease course, including elevated D-dimer levels, a high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and older age (5, 6). Because of the novelty of the                     pathogen, little is known about the causes of death in affected patients and its specific pathologic features. Despite modern diagnostic tests, autopsy is still of great importance and may be a key to understanding the biological characteristics of SARS–CoV-2 and the pathogenesis of the disease. Ideally, knowledge gained in this way can influence therapeutic strategies and ultimately reduce mortality. To our knowledge, only 3 case reports have been published about COVID-19 patients who have undergone complete autopsy (7, 8). Therefore, in this study we investigated the value of autopsy for determining the cause of death and describe the pathologic characteristics in patients who died of COVID-19. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS–CoV-2, the authorities of the German federal state of Hamburg ordered mandatory autopsies in all patients dying with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The legal basis for this was section 25(4) of the German Infection Protection Act. Because of legal regulations, no COVID-19 death was exempted from this order, even if its clinical cause seemed obvious. The case series demonstrated herein consists of 12 consecutive autopsies, starting with the first known SARS–CoV-2–positive death occurring in Hamburg (the second largest city in Germany, with 1.8 million inhabitants). All autopsies were performed at the Department of Legal Medicine of University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. The Ethics Committee of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians was informed about the study (no. WF-051/20). The study was approved by the local clinical institutional                         review board and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. In all deceased patients, postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) and a complete autopsy, including histopathologic and virologic evaluation, were performed. Clinical records were checked for preexisting medical conditions and medications, current medical course, and antemortem diagnostic findings. Computed tomographic examination was done at the Department of Legal Medicine with a Philips Brilliance 16-slice multidetector scanner in accordance with an established protocol (9). In brief, full-body computed tomography was performed from top to thigh (slice thickness, 1 mm; pitch, 1.5; 120 kV; 230 to 250 mAs), complemented by dedicated scans of the thorax with higher resolution (slice thickness, 0.8 mm; pitch, 1.0; 120 kV; 230 to 250 mAS). We performed external examinations and full-body autopsies on all deceased persons with SARS–CoV-2 positivity (PCR confirmed) as soon as possible after taking proper safety precautions (using personal protection equipment with proper donning and doffing), following guidelines from the German Association of Pathologists, which are closely aligned with relevant international guidelines. The recently published recommendations for the performance of autopsies in cases of suspected COVID-19 were                         taken into account (10). The interval from death to postmortem imaging and autopsy (postmortem interval) ranged from 1 to 5 days. During autopsy, tissue samples for histology were taken from the following organs: heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, brain, prostate and testes (in males), ovaries (in females), small bowel, saphenous vein, common carotid artery, pharynx, and muscle. For virologic testing, we took small samples of heart, lungs, liver, kidney, saphenous vein, and pharynx and sampled the venous blood. Tissue samples for histopathologic examination were fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde and processed via standard procedure to slides stained with hematoxylin–eosin. For the lung samples, we also used the keratin marker AE1/AE3 (Dako) for immunohistochemistry.",2020-05-06 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
DOI:10.7326/M20-1326,10.7326/M20-1326,Ideas and Opinions,Health Care Supply Chains: COVID-19 Challenges and Pressing Actions,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has exposed significant glitches in health care supply chains, which are complex and highly fragmented. Health care requires 5 categories of products: pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, medical devices, medical supplies, and blood. Each of these categories has a distinct supply chain, and the failure of any 1 of these chains can wreak havoc on the health care system. Drugs have long life cycles, their supply chain is global, and pharmaceutical imports are high—44% for branded and 38% for generic drugs—and increasing (1). Many active pharmaceutical ingredients are manufactured only overseas. An estimated two thirds (2) of the active ingredients of generic drugs used in the United States come from China. Italy, Belgium, and the United Kingdom are in the top 10 by dollar value of U.S. pharmaceutical imports (3), as well as by number of reported COVID-19 deaths per capita. Regulatory restrictions and virus-related manufacturing issues are disrupting global supply chains for pharmaceuticals. The United States has benefited so far from a substantial pipeline inventory, which is the result of long supply chains, batch manufacturing (which averts cross-contamination), large-scale production, and 3 months' worth (1)                     of stockpiled inventory at U.S. pharmaceutical companies. Once this pipeline inventory is depleted, however, shortages could follow. The immediate action plan should be to actively monitor drug supplies—not only within the United States but also back to tier 2 and 3 suppliers. End-to-end transparency will give us advance warning when upstream disruptions occur. A longer-term solution is to reshore drug manufacturing for critical drugs, or at least to develop a dual supply chain in which three fourths of the domestic demand is met by domestic production. This will improve the traceability, resiliency, and responsiveness of our pharmaceutical supply chain. Health care providers treating patients with COVID-19 must be fully protected with gowns, gloves, masks, and face shields. In early March, the nation's emergency stockpile had 12 million N95 respirators (4). The stockpile level should have been much higher, as evidenced by standard analysis of opportunity costs. Because U.S. manufacturing capacity is limited, it would take more than 4 months to fill the need for 300 million respirators (5); this limitation has put providers at risk. Although capacity has increased, new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has increased demand from the general public. The upshot is that providers are now forced to reuse protective masks. States, hospital systems, and the federal government are all competing for the same resources and paying a significant premium over list price—which can be prevented if these entities coordinate their plans. In the                     long run, a judiciously maintained emergency stockpile, rotated to keep inventory fresh, will prevent this situation from recurring. Medical devices have highly regulated supply chains (6). This is both a blessing and a curse: It ensures product functionality, reliability, and quality, but it keeps prices prohibitive. In addition, high entry barriers stifle competition, innovation, and commoditization. For instance, the United States has about 160 000 ventilators (7). Accurately forecasting demand is difficult because of the fluidity of the pandemic situation and the uncertainty surrounding ventilator effectiveness for COVID-19. But shortfalls can be costly, and limited capacity is hampering the few approved U.S. manufacturers from increasing production. Lack of standardization across brands exacerbates this problem (7). Whereas supply chains for computers, automobiles, and smartphones use interchangeable components, ventilators require specially manufactured components, so scaling up capacity is difficult.                     Augmenting capacity by involving manufacturers from other industries is a good first step. It is also necessary to try new methods, such as 3D printing, which is more versatile and could potentially utilize capacity in university laboratories. Recent initiatives to develop open-source ventilators can help establish alternate supply chains in the short run (although product reliability is at risk). It is also crucial to remember that user interfaces differ across ventilators; they are not like laptops or automobiles, for which switching brands is easy. Acclimatizing to different ventilators places an unnecessary burden on health care professionals, wresting valuable time and energy from patient care. Moreover, switching ventilators for successive patients may result in avoidable inefficiencies. Locations with various ventilator types will require a wider array of replacement parts, increasing the likelihood of mismatches between part availability and need. Therefore,                     coordinated procurement across the entire U.S. health care system is essential so that homogeneity of ventilators is maintained at each location. Looking ahead, we must create a more agile supply chain for ventilators and other critical medical devices by improving product design and judiciously relaxing underlying regulations. Medical supplies consist of testing materials, laboratory and intravenous kits, surgical center supplies, and other items, and they constitute a significant proportion of the total expense in a health system (8). Supply chain issues have frustrated response strategies. For example, only 2 companies supply the nasopharyngeal swabs needed to collect testing samples (9). Newer tests and alternate testing protocols (10) are helping now, but building redundancy and developing contingency plans for medical supplies will help prepare us better for the next lethal virus.",2020-05-05 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
DOI:10.7326/M20-1632,10.7326/M20-1632,Reviews,Epidemiology of and Risk Factors for Coronavirus Infection in Health Care Workers: A Living Rapid Review,"A cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019 (1). The cause was identified as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2–4), and the disease was named “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-2019) (5). Health care workers (HCWs) are at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection (6), and reports have described COVID-19 cases in HCWs since early in the outbreak (7). Preventing HCW infections is important for reducing morbidity and potential mortality, maintaining health system capacity, and reducing secondary transmission (8, 9). This rapid review summarizes the evidence on the burden of and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCWs. The report will be used by WHO to inform the development of evidence-based guidance. Because evidence is limited on SARS-CoV-2, this review also includes 2 coronaviruses associated with earlier pneumonia outbreaks: SARS-CoV-1 (causing severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS-1]) and MERS-CoV (causing Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). Detailed methods are available in the full report (10). The key questions were developed by WHO with input from the review authors. Key Question 1.

DOI:10.7326/M20-2627,10.7326/M20-2627,Editorials,Keeping Up With Emerging Evidence in (Almost) Real Time,"Although many aspects of daily life have come to a halt during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, research certainly has not. The pursuit of evidence to prevent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), improve patient outcomes, and quell the pandemic is fast and furious. Clinicians and epidemiologists are rushing to report their observations, investigators are launching trials with very short timelines for completion, and journals are receiving record numbers of manuscript submissions. In just 6 weeks during March and April 2020, Annals received one quarter the number of manuscript submissions we received during all of 2019 and, like many journals, Annals is speeding peer review and publication of manuscripts found to be suitable for our readers. This frenetic pace can leave us with “evidence whiplash.” What was thought to be true or promising one day is sometimes found to be                     false or dangerous a short while later. Continual piecemeal release of evidence can be confusing and can contribute to information overload, especially when the new evidence is flawed or uncertain. The rapid accumulation of evidence presents particular challenges for those working to summarize available evidence to inform answers to the many pressing questions the pandemic has generated. Rapid and/or living systematic reviews offer a potential solution (1, 2). Annals' first rapid, living systematic review appears in this issue. Chou and colleagues examine the burden of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus on health care workers (HCWs) and risk factors for infection (3). They searched multiple electronic databases, including a World Health Organization database of publications on coronavirus diseases and the medRxiv preprint server, from 2003 through 27 March 2020, with ongoing surveillance through 24 April 2020, for studies reporting incidence of or outcomes associated with coronavirus infections in HCWs and studies on the association between risk factors and infection. They found that HCWs experienced significant burden from coronavirus infections and that personal protective equipment and infection control training were associated with decreased infection risk while certain exposures were associated with increased risk. Of the 64 studies that                     met inclusion criteria, only 18 addressed SARS-CoV-2. Recognizing that the conclusions of this systematic review will likely become outdated quickly as more evidence on SARS-CoV-2 emerges, the authors planned for this systematic review to be both “rapid” and “living.” A rapid review simplifies or omits some components of the systematic review process to produce information in a timely manner (1). Given the urgency of the pandemic, Chou and colleagues streamlined the systematic review process by not registering the protocol prospectively, limiting the search of the gray literature, restricting dual review to only 25% of abstracts, conducting single-reviewer data abstraction and assessment of study limitations, and using no formal instrument for critical appraisal of the evidence (3). A living systematic review includes a prospective plan for continual surveillance of evidence with periodic critical appraisal and synthesis of new evidence (2). The methods of living systematic reviews are similar to those of traditional systematic reviews, though living reviews also include explicit, transparent, and predefined decisions about how often and for how long new evidence will be sought and screened, as well as when and how new evidence will be incorporated into the review (4). For example, Chou and colleagues plan to update their search monthly (3). Both rapid reviews and traditional systematic reviews may become living reviews. Those who conduct living reviews commit to immediate incorporation of any newly identified important evidence. Journals that publish living reviews must commit to communicating the updated evidence to readers. At Annals, we anticipate 3 potential outcomes of periodic evidence updates: no new evidence is identified; new evidence is identified, but it changes neither the nature nor the strength of prior conclusions; and new evidence emerges that warrants a substantive change in the nature and/or strength of the prior evidence synthesis.",2020-05-05 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

DOI:10.7326/M20-0504,10.7326/M20-0504,Original Research,The Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) From Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases: Estimation and Application,"In December 2019, a cluster of severe pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The initial cluster was epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, although many of the initial 41 cases were later reported to have no known exposure to the market (1). A novel strain of coronavirus belonging to the same family of viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as the 4 human coronaviruses associated with the common cold, was subsequently isolated from lower respiratory tract samples of 4 cases on 7 January 2020 (2). Infection with the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can be asymptomatic or can result in mild to severe symptomatic disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) (3).                 On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and more than 80 000 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide as of 28 February 2020 (4, 5). On 31 January 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that all citizens returning from Hubei province, China, would be subject to mandatory quarantine for up to 14 days (6). Our current understanding of the incubation period for COVID-19 is limited. An early analysis based on 88 confirmed cases in Chinese provinces outside Wuhan, using data on known travel to and from Wuhan to estimate the exposure interval, indicated a mean incubation period of 6.4 days (95% CI, 5.6 to 7.7 days), with a range of 2.1 to 11.1 days (7). Another analysis based on 158 confirmed cases outside Wuhan estimated a median incubation period of 5.0 days (CI, 4.4 to 5.6 days), with a range of 2 to 14 days (8). These estimates are generally consistent with estimates from 10 confirmed cases in China (mean incubation period, 5.2 days [CI, 4.1 to 7.0 days] [9]) and from clinical reports of a familial cluster of COVID-19 in which symptom onset occurred 3 to 6 days after assumed exposure in Wuhan (1). These estimates of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 are also in line with those of other known human coronaviruses, including SARS (mean, 5 days; range, 2 to 14 days [10]), MERS (mean, 5 to 7 days; range, 2 to 14 days [11]), and non-SARS human coronavirus (mean, 3 days; range, 2 to 5 days [12]). The incubation period can inform several important public health activities for infectious diseases, including active monitoring, surveillance, control, and modeling. Active monitoring requires potentially exposed persons to contact local health authorities to report their health status every day. Understanding the length of active monitoring needed to limit the risk for missing SARS-CoV-2 infections is necessary for health departments to effectively use limited resources. In this article, we provide estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 and the number of symptomatic infections missed under different active monitoring scenarios. We searched for news and public health reports of confirmed COVID-19 cases in areas with no known community transmission, including provinces, regions, and countries outside Hubei. We searched for reports in both English and Chinese and abstracted the data necessary to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. Two authors independently reviewed the full text of each case report. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus. For each case, we recorded the time of possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2, any symptom onset, fever onset, and case detection. The exact time of events was used when possible; otherwise, we defined conservative upper and lower bounds for the possible interval of each event. For most cases, the interval of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure was defined as the time between the earliest possible arrival to and latest possible departure from Wuhan. For cases without history of travel to Wuhan but with assumed exposure to an infectious person, the interval of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure was defined as the maximum possible interval of exposure to the infectious person, including time before the infectious person was symptomatic. We allowed for the possibility of continued exposure within known clusters (for example, families traveling together) when the ordering of transmission was unclear. We assumed that exposure always preceded symptom onset. If we were unable to determine the                     latest exposure time from the available case report, we defined the upper bound of the exposure interval to be the latest possible time of symptom onset. When the earliest possible time of exposure could not be determined, we defined it as 1 December 2019, the date of symptom onset in the first known case (1); we performed a sensitivity analysis for the selection of this universal lower bound. When the earliest possible time of symptom onset could not be determined, we assumed it to be the earliest time of possible exposure. When the latest time of possible symptom onset could not be determined, we assumed it to be the latest time of possible case detection. Data on age, sex, country of residence, and possible exposure route were also collected.",2020-03-10 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

Objective: To describe the histopathologic changes in the lung of a patient with COVID-19. Case Report: A 72-year-old man with a history of diabetes and hypertension presented with fever and cough. His throat and pharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by day 6 after the initial symptoms. Rapidly progressive respiratory failure required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation 1 week after presentation. Lung tissue was obtained by transthoracic 14-gauge needle biopsy from the left upper anterior segment (Figure 1, A, arrow), left upper lingular segment (Figure 1, B, arrow), and left lower lobe (Figure 1, C, arrow), coinciding with ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography (CT).

DOI:10.7326/M20-0751,10.7326/M20-0751,Ideas and Opinions,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Protecting Hospitals From the Invisible,"It is increasingly apparent that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is optimized to spread widely. It causes mild but prolonged disease, infected persons are contagious even when minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, the incubation period can extend beyond 14 days, and some patients seem susceptible to reinfection (1–3). These factors make it inevitable that patients with respiratory viral syndromes that are mild or nonspecific will introduce the virus into hospitals, leading to clusters of nosocomial infections. The signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are largely indistinguishable from those of other respiratory virus infections. Less than one half of patients with confirmed disease have fever on initial presentation (4). The sensitivity of a single nasopharyngeal swab early in the course of disease is only 70% (5). Multiple reports already exist of delayed diagnoses leading to nosocomial transmissions. How bad will it be? Characterizing the morbidity rate of COVID-19 is challenging because case detection in the early stages of an outbreak is biased toward severe disease. An initial series reported a mortality rate of 15% (6). A subsequent analysis that included patients who were less sick reported a mortality rate of 2.3% (7), but this is still likely an overestimate. Mortality rates are substantially lower outside than inside Hubei province, where the outbreak began (114 deaths among 13 152 patients [0.9%] vs. 2986 deaths among 67 707 patients [4.4%] as of 8 March 2020). This is presumably because of Hubei's initial focus on patients with severe disease, constraints on the province's testing and care capacity, and the passage of more time since the outbreak began in Hubei versus other provinces allowing more time for patients to declare themselves (8). More to the point,                     current mortality estimates minimally account for patients with mild or asymptomatic infections, an important aspect of this epidemic (9). Case detection is still primarily focused on identifying patients with fever, cough, or shortness of breath; this focus leads to underestimation of the number of infected persons, overestimation of the mortality rate, and ongoing spread of disease. What can we do to prevent further spread of infection? We have to be more aggressive about case detection. Current screening is still focused on identifying patients with foreign travel or contacts with known cases. Both of these foci no longer reflect the current status of this epidemic given increasing evidence of community spread. We need to be able to test patients with milder syndromes regardless of travel or contact history. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its “person under investigation” criteria to permit this, but there is still a severe shortage of readily available tests. More broadly, however, the best way to protect hospitals against COVID-19 is to bolster our approach to routine respiratory viruses (that is, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and “conventional” coronaviruses). This will simultaneously improve care for current patients, make work safer for clinicians, and help prevent the incursion of occult COVID-19 into hospitals. We underestimate the contagiousness and seriousness of routine respiratory viruses. We underappreciate that 30% to 50% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, that nosocomial transmission of respiratory viruses is common, and that “routine” respiratory viruses cause substantial morbidity and mortality that may not differ much from those caused by SARS-CoV-2 once minimally symptomatic COVID-19 is accounted for. Respiratory viruses infect millions of persons each year (about 10% of the population) and                     cause tens of thousands of deaths in the United States alone (10). They can cause severe pneumonia, predispose patients to bacterial superinfection, and exacerbate cardiac and pulmonary conditions up to and including death. Most hospitals, however, manage respiratory viruses passively. We rely on signs alone to deter visitors with upper respiratory tract infections from visiting, we isolate patients in private rooms only if they test positive for influenza virus (even though many other viruses can cause influenza-like syndromes that are equally morbid), we discontinue precautions in patients with acute respiratory tract syndromes if they test negative for viruses (even though viral tests have variable and imperfect sensitivity), we consider masks alone to be adequate protection (even though viruses can be transmitted via fomites and eye contact as well as mouth and nose contact), and we tolerate health care workers coming to work with upper respiratory tract infections so long as they are not febrile.",2020-03-11 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511

As of 7 March 2020, a total of 423 cases and 19 deaths, including several non–travel-related cases, areas of sustained community transmission, and a nursing home outbreak, have been reported (1). Best-case estimates suggest that COVID-19 will stress bed capacity, equipment, and health care personnel in U.S. hospitals in ways not previously experienced (2). How can health systems prepare to care for a large influx of patients with this disease? Approximately 95 000 critical care beds, including surgical and specialty unit beds, are available in U.S. hospitals today (3). Conservative estimates suggest that we may need almost twice this amount should the COVID-19 pandemic resemble the influenza pandemics of 1957 or 1968, especially if it is sustained (4). Because some patients will be critically ill and need scarce resources, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ventilators (5), hospitals must prepare now for how they will triage patients, allocate resources, and staff wards. The Table lists the essential elements of a hospital's planning process. Hospitals should attempt to geographically cohort patients with COVID-19 to limit the number of health care personnel exposed and conserve supplies. This type of geographic capacity generation is extremely difficult because many U.S. hospitals run at full capacity. Geographic cohorting options may also be challenged by locations of airborne isolation rooms, with negative pressure being scattered throughout the hospital. It may be necessary to use innovative approaches, such as converting single rooms to double occupancy; expediting discharges; slowing admission rates; and converting spaces like catheterization laboratories, lobbies, postoperative care units, or waiting rooms into patient care venues. For example, at Michigan Medicine, designated beds in critical care units and non–critical care settings for persons under investigation and patients who test positive for COVID-19 have been identified. A dedicated team of hospitalists and critical care providers                     has been established, with clinical schedules and roles for leadership, communication, and activation criteria. Contingency plans have been developed, including activation criteria for opening a respiratory intensive care floor where cohorting of both critically ill and noncritically ill patients can occur. Similarly, ensuring the ongoing care of vulnerable patients, such as those in the posttransplant and immunocompromised communities, remains imperative. Safe locations and staffing plans that separate vulnerable patients from COVID-19 activities have been carefully considered.",2020-03-11 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-13 13:16:30.071511
