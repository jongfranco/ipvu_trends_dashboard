News reports and communications from the US Federal Government had emphasised that COVID-19 was a particular problem for older people, and a resistance to social distancing and sheltering in place by younger people might have been informed by this idea. However, as the pandemic hit the Johns Hopkins Hospital in late March, 2020, younger patients began to be admitted to our ICU, many of whom were also obese. An informal survey of colleagues directing ICUs at other hospitals around the country yielded similar findings.

In theory, prisoners have the same right to health as anyone else, but the reality is very different. Talha Burki reports.We will probably never know the extent to which coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has penetrated the world's prisons and detention centres. Testing capacity and the supply of personal protective equipment are already constrained, and inmates are rarely a priority. Nonetheless, at least one prison has done mass testing. The Marion Correctional Institution in Ohio, USA, holds around 2500 detainees. As The Lancet went to press, more than 2000 of them had tested positive for COVID-19.According to the New York City Board of Correction, there are currently 378 cases of COVID-19 among inmates in the city jails, equating to an infection rate of around 10%. But this does not include those who contracted the virus in custody and have since been released or transferred, or have died. Hundreds of cases have been registered among prison and jail employees, who can obtain testing far more easily than prisoners, including almost 1000 in New York City alone.“The prisons and jails in the USA that have reported high rates of the coronavirus are the ones who are doing the testing”, points out David Patton, executive director and attorney-in-chief of the Federal Defenders of New York. “It is hard to imagine that the virus is not already rampant throughout the US penal system.” Around 2·2 million individuals are incarcerated in the USA; no other country imprisons as many people.In the UK, COVID-19 has been detected in the majority of prisons, and at least 15 prisoners and four members of staff have died after being infected. For much of the rest of the world, statistics on infection rates and mortality in prisons are hard to come by, but the danger that COVID-19 poses to such institutions can be discerned from another set of statistics.The global prison population is estimated at 11 million. At least 124 prisons worldwide exceed their maximum occupancy rates. The Philippines has imprisoned 215 000 people in a system designed for no more than 40 000. 92 000 inmates are thought to be scattered across Myanmar's 100 or so prisons and labour camps, served by a medical staff that is estimated to consist of 30 doctors and 80 nurses. A quarter of inmates in Canada are over the age of 50 years. The UK Justice Secretary, Robert Buckland, reckons that around 1800 prisoners in the UK would be especially susceptible to severe disease were they to contract COVID-19.The situation in Latin America is particularly worrying. Haiti's prisons are running at 450% occupancy. 773 151 people are imprisoned in Brazil, in a system built to hold 461 026 people. “Conditions in the prisons in South America are ripe for coronavirus to spread”, said Tamara Taraciuk Broner of Human Rights Watch (Buenos Aires, Argentina). “These places are typically very unsanitary and overcrowded and inmates do not always have access to running water.” In such circumstances, regular handwashing and social distancing are impossible to achieve.“Prisoners share toilets, bathrooms, sinks, and dining halls. They are mostly sleeping in bunk beds; in some countries they sleep crammed together on the floor”, explains Frederick Altice of the Yale School of Medicine (New Haven, CT, USA). “These settings are in no way equipped to deal with an outbreak once it gets in.” If an institution is already operating at far beyond its capacity, it is going to be very difficult to find areas where prisoners with suspected COVID-19 can be isolated. “If a prisoner knows he is going to be put in solitary confinement if he admits to being sick, which is usually a punishment, then there is a heavy disincentive to seek medical attention”, adds Patton.Prisoners tend to be in worse health than the wider population. “80–90% of people charged with a crime in the USA are too poor to afford legal counsel”, notes Patton. “They have high rates of asthma, diabetes, and smoking”. Prison itself is hardly a healthy environment. A lot of time is spent sitting around, and the food is typically poor quality. And in some places, even poor-quality food is in short supply.View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Maria Tan/AFP/Getty ImagesView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Maria Tan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe occupancy rate for prisons in DR Congo is estimated at 432% of capacity, but food is budgeted on official capacity. That means a maximum of one meal a day. According to the UN peacekeeping mission in DR Congo, at least 60 people died from hunger at Kinshasa's central prison during the first 2 months of 2020. In Niger, those in pretrial detention, a cohort that makes up over half the prison population, are not provided with any food at all. If you cannot rely on family or friends to bring in supplies, you are in serious trouble.International norms stipulate that prisoners should receive the same standard of health care as the wider community. The reality is very different. “First of all, if you are a prisoner, you cannot just choose to visit the emergency room; you have to go through the officers and that can be a huge obstacle”, said Altice. “Almost no prisons have real hospitals within their walls, and the ratio of clinical staff to prisoners is extremely low; there is no true equivalence of care”.Sending prisoners for external medical care means seconding officers and transport. Prison administrators can be reluctant to expend such time and resources on a single inmate. “There is both a lack of ability to deal with health issues in-house, because of chronic understaffing, and disincentives to seek outside attention”, said Patton. “It means that prisoners have to be in a very bad state before they get the treatment they need.”View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Reuters/Jim VondruskaView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Reuters/Jim VondruskaMatters are further complicated during a time of pandemic, when moving prisoners requires all kinds of additional precautions. “It is very likely that prisoners are not getting medical care or even assessments”, said Altice. “Prisons do not usually have any way to manage patients when they start deteriorating or to triage people at higher risk; prisoners who do get shipped out for treatment are at a much later stage of disease because detection abilities are often limited.”The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has encouraged governments to release inmates who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, such as older people, as well as low-risk offenders. “Imprisonment should be a measure of last resort, particularly during this crisis”, she noted, in a statement on March 25, 2020. Experts believe that there is plenty of scope for prisoner releases. In at least 46 countries worldwide, the majority of prisoners have not been convicted of any crime. Rates of pretrial detention are high. A third of Brazil's sizeable prison population, for example, are in pretrial detention. More than one in six prisoners around the world are serving time for possession of drugs for personal use.“Deincarceration has to be the foremost strategy here”, said Altice. “Several countries, including the USA, have extraordinarily high levels of incarceration. It will certainly be possible to release prisoners and maintain public safety.” He advocates diverting drug offenders to evidence-based treatment programmes. “You can take a lot of people out of the system by doing that, and these are people who are at increased risk of comorbidities such as HIV and hepatitis C, so there is an immediate public health benefit”, said Altice.Several countries have taken action. Iran announced the release of 85 000 prisoners in March. France and Italy have reduced their prison populations by 10 000 and 6000, respectively. Chile has let out 1300 low-risk offenders, and states across the USA are releasing varying numbers of prisoners. “There is absolutely no doubt that this crisis calls for reducing overcrowding and finding alternatives to prison for people in particular categories, definitely those in pretrial detention for non-violent offences”, Broner told The Lancet. She gave the example of semiopen facilities in Brazil, where prisoners spend the day outside the institution and return in the evening. “That is a huge risk for transmission of COVID-19; it would be better to allow these prisoners to just remain outside”, she said.UK prisons are running at 107% capacity, which is modest by international standards. The government has pledged to release 4000 prisoners to alleviate the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, the Prison Governors Association reckons that 15 000 inmates, representing almost a fifth of the prison population, would have to be let out if prisoners were to not share cells. Making a meaningful difference to overcrowding in prison systems elsewhere will require far larger measures. Whether governments are willing to release prisoners in the numbers necessary to truly cut the risk of COVID-19 from tearing through prisons remains to seen.",,LANCET

Fighting the pandemic of COVID-19 has become the main challenge for all clinicians.The Wuhan Union Hospital is in the eye of the storm, treating patients within three designated medical settings, including a cancer centre. Between January and March, 2020, we have treated more than 5200 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and cared for more than 20 000 with fever at our outpatient clinics. Moreover, we have attended to more than 80 000 patients on our internet platform and operated two makeshift hospitals (so-called Fangcang hospitals), making Wuhan Union Hospital the hospital that admitted and treated the highest number of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan. As oncologists, we are also involved in the battle to contain the relentless spread of the epidemic. From Jan 15 to Feb 25, 2020, 1186 patients with cancer (including 165 haematological malignancies) were admitted to the Cancer Center of Wuhan Union Hospital. Unlike many other patients, the immunity of patients with cancer is often compromised and they heavily depend on the availability of medical resources, which renders them extremely vulnerable to the impact of the epidemic and overwhelmed medical resources mean their lives are on the line. Therefore, we were faced with the great challenge of how to protect our patients with cancer from infection while continuing routine patient care.Zhong Nanshan (Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong), head of the National Health Commission's team investigating the novel coronavirus outbreak, pointed out that SARS-CoV-2 carried the risk of human-to-human transmission on Jan 20, 2020. Since then, our cancer centre began to screen patients and health-care workers infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital by means of nucleic acid and antibody tests in combination with CT scans. 24 patients with cancer (infection rate of 2%) and 13 of 766 health-care workers (infection rate of 1·7%) were found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. These rates were, respectively, 5-times and 4·3-times the rate in the population in Wuhan. We began to realise the gravity of the situation. To prevent cross-infection in the centre, we rapidly set up an isolation area. In 48 h, an isolation ward area equipped with 850 beds was established, with an increased prevention level compared with the rest of the hospital. Because of insufficient stockpile and rapid use of medical supplies, medical resources were severely depleted. At one point, protective equipment supplies could only meet the need for 2 days. Moreover, with increasing numbers of medical workers being diagnosed with COVID-19 and quarantined, the capacity for normal patient care services was conspicuously reduced. We discharged mild and convalescent patients whenever possible, who were followed up with telemedicine and telecare. The first 15 days after Wuhan lockdown, starting from Jan 23, was the toughest time we experienced, during which seven patients with blood cancer and two patients with solid tumours died of COVID-19. After our cancer centre was mandatorily designated a hospital on Feb 15, and thus only admitted patients with COVID-19, a large amount of medical supplies began to arrive and reinforcement medical teams from all parts of China joined us. Since then, no deaths or nosocomial infections occurred. Looking back, we gained a lot of experience and learned some lessons.View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Yu HuView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Yu HuFor the management of hospitalised patients with cancer, the top priority is the control of nosocomial infection. At the early stage of the outbreak, because of a lack of awareness on personal protection, limited knowledge about the new virus, and an inadequate supply of nucleic acid tests, the number of infected patients increased substantially and some medical staff were infected. During the middle of January, some hospitalised patients began to develop fever and diarrhoea, but were not definitively diagnosed with COVID-19 because of a shortage of tests. They interacted with other patients without COVID-19, causing cross-infection. Therefore, we escalated the preventive measures, including early stage testing of patients, caregivers, and medical staff (using nucleic acid tests, antibody tests, and CT scans); isolation of confirmed patients in a single room without visits; wearing of surgical masks by patients and caregivers; mandatory hand sanitisation; and separate disposal of patient waste. Hospital workers are at high risk of developing COVID-19 from nosocomial infection during an outbreak, as in the epidemics of SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. During a pandemic of an infectious disease, medical workers should be well informed about its status to achieve their own early detection, prompt isolation, and expeditious treatment. Medical workers should take adequate measures to effectively protect themselves from infection. When some of our medical workers were infected and isolated, we suffered from a serious shortage of medical staff. To ensure the normal operation of oncology departments, the hospital authorities redeployed and temporarily relocated 50 doctors and nurses from other not-in-service departments to oncology departments. It is worth mentioning that medical workers in the reinforcement medical teams consisted of specialists in serious infections and management of respiratory tract diseases, and they had important roles in the management of severe and critical patients in the Cancer Center of Wuhan Union Hospital.To treat the growing number of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection, confirmed cases were admitted as early as possible and non-confirmed cases were redirected to other hospitals. We set up a free-of-charge online fever clinic on Feb 1, and received 12 000 visits per day at the peak, including visits by many patients with cancer. For offline services, we opened a separate area of the hospital as a fever clinic, expanded it, and placed 46 beds in the observation area. Because patients with cancer are physically debilitated and tend to have compromised immune systems, they have to be carefully evaluated before admission. Stable patients (ie, those without progression or deterioration in tumour burden or severe complications after treatment) generally should not be hospitalised; patients scheduled for elective operations should, whenever possible, be admitted after the pandemic. Patients with chronic tumours can consult their doctor via internet or telephone, with medicines mailed to the patients. Routine screening and nucleic acid tests can be put off until the pandemic is over. We operated a 24 h emergency department for patients who needed emergency care or are in a serious condition. We also opened a green passage (ie, a quick and efficient service) for pregnant women and patients with cancer who have to be treated immediately. Apart from these measures, when not enough beds are available, patients with suspected or mild-symptom disease can be referred to Fangcang hospitals, but should be under close watch. If their conditions deteriorate, they can be sent to designated hospitals. For instance, nine patients admitted after Feb 15 were transferred to our hospital from Fangcang hospitals and received excellent treatment.Patients with cancer are a special group of patients because treatment of their primary disease cannot be discontinued However, to decrease the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, postoperative chemotherapy could be postponed. With patients on radiotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy could be withheld for some time, including preradiotherapy preparation (such as pretreatment imaging for tumour localisation and treatment planning). For patients on chemotherapy, especially elderly, debilitated patients, the chemotherapy protocol should be adjusted, the dose reduced, or both. The fatality rate was six (46·2%) of 13 patients with blood cancer and two (10·0%) of 20 patients with solid tumours in our centre. Patients with blood cancer were more predisposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection than were patients with solid tumours (in hospitalised patients, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection was ten [6·1%] of 165 patients with blood tumours and 14 [1·4%] of 1021 patients with solid tumours). The higher fatality rate in patients with blood cancer might be ascribed to aggressive chemotherapeutic protocols, agranulocytosis, and impaired immunity. Given the risk of infection and shortage of blood products, these patients should avoid intense chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Among the 33 patients with cancer with COVID-19 (figure 1), eight treated by targeted therapies (kinase inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors) and two receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors had more favourable outcomes than those treated with chemotherapy. With patients who are at home or visiting online clinics, chemotherapy-free alternatives involving oral or targeted drugs—which do not require in-hospital administration—should be given whenever possible. One patient tried to die by suicide after he became infected with SARS-CoV-2 following stem cell transplantation. Although his blood virus tests turned negative after an initial positive result, the long isolation and the pain due to graft-versus-host disease psychologically affected the patient. Therefore, psychological intervention is extremely important for patients with COVID-19 who have experienced other issues, physically and mentally, apart from their primary disease.Figure 1Categorisation of patients with cancer with COVID-19 and treatments they receivedShow full captionALL=acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Our online clinic services cover video consultations, text-picture counselling, and medicine delivery, among others. This approach substantially reduced people congregating in hospital. Patients with newly diagnosed cancer or those on anti-tumour therapy should use internet or telephone services as the first choice to contact their doctors, refraining from going directly to hospital, to avoid infection. Doctors should comprehensively evaluate the condition of patients to give the most effective or optimal treatments. Patients and their family members should be made aware that cooperating with their doctor and being compliant with the treatment prescribed will lead to the best outcomes. During this epidemic, we attended more than 80 000 patients online, including 2688 patients with cancer. By comparing the numbers of the patients who sought medical help online, we found that each of 24 oncologists who provided these services, on average, attended 19 patients online and 97 clinic visitors during the first 2 weeks before Jan 20. Conversely, during the 2 weeks after Jan 20, the number of online patients rose to 42 whereas the number of clinic visitors dropped to 36 (figure 2). We believe, in the future, telemedicine will be an important practicing mode for oncologists or other clinicians during pandemics.Figure 2Average number of online and clinic visitors per week per oncologistView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT)Between January and March, 2020, we witnessed the infection and deaths of a large number of people because of lack of protection, shortage of beds, and inadequate isolation. We should learn from our mistakes and stay alert. A well established public health system is essential for continuity of care during a massive epidemic. To prevent the epidemic from returning, we should be well informed about COVID-19, do early screening, protect our medical workers, properly equip our hospitals for both routine service and future crises and expand our services to internet platforms. As oncologists, we hope that society extends its compassion towards patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.We declare no competing interestsYH is funded by a Key Special Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2020YFC0845700)",,LANCET

These decisions made under the duress of the pandemic will have grave consequences for cancer mortality for years to come.Those recently diagnosed with cancer, or in the midst of cancer treatment, are facing disruption for all but the most urgent procedures because of concerns about their susceptibility to the serious risks of COVID-19, and the redeployment of personnel, beds, and equipment to COVID-19 wards. Hospital capacity has also been depleted due to COVID-19 cases in health-care workers themselves, and oncologists have not been spared. Official advice is that urgent cancer care can continue, but other treatments should be rationed and adapted. These decisions, however, are inconsistent, and not evidence-based—multidisciplinary teams are being put in the unenviable position of making best guesses for each patient. However, treatment delays and adaptations can risk, for example, operable or curable cancers developing into inoperable disease with a far worse prognosis. In many cases, and especially in resource-constrained settings, balancing the risks of undertreatment with those of COVID-19 infection will lead to situations where there is no obvious best course of action. As societies and governments scramble to provide guidelines for patients with cancer, frontline medical staff are being forced to make on-the-fly treatment decisions, and, unfortunately, many patients will receive suboptimal care.Importantly, cancer screening and diagnosis is also being affected by reprioritisation of health-care services during the pandemic. For example, in the UK, urgent suspected cancer referrals normally eligible for the 2-week wait target are now subject to prioritisation rules that will cause delays. Additionally, because UK screening programmes have been suspended, diagnoses will depend on presentation of patients with cancer symptoms. Worries about spreading and contracting COVID-19, and fear that COVID-19 is rampant in hospitals and other health-care facilities, might dissuade patients with symptoms from contacting their family doctors. Delayed cancer diagnoses during the next weeks and months risks many thousands of cases going undetected and untreated. Knock-on effects, related to a surge in demand for cancer-related services once the pandemic has passed its peak, coupled with an increase in advanced-stage cancers due to diagnostic delays and under treatment, could overwhelm health services and contribute to an excess in cancer-related mortality in the coming years.The pandemic is also affecting patients with cancer who are in follow up—for example, those in remission or receiving palliative care for late-stage disease. Cancer surveillance and management of cancer-related symptoms and treatment sequelae are managed by primary care physicians in many countries, or as home-based or outpatient services. However, the pandemic has restricted access to just the types of resources these patients need—in-home health-care workers, primary care appointments, and supportive care medications. Because appropriate and timely supportive care can extend overall survival, availability of these services is crucial to prevent not only morbidity, but also premature death.Overall, disruption to the full spectrum of medical cancer care services will undoubtedly have a large effect on cancer-related mortality. A 5–10% decrease in survival in high-income countries has been predicted, which will account for hundreds of thousands of excess deaths, dwarfing those caused by COVID-19—but we are missing precise data on mortality that can be used to anticipate future cancer care needs. Therefore, we call for research into the long-term impact on cancer-related mortality resulting from cancer care decisions being made globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we advocate that pandemic preparedness plans must account for the resources needed to maintain high-quality, evidence-based continuity of care of people with cancer, including workforce and service capacity needs, and a robust referral and diagnostics service. Oncologists must be included in the group of care workers who require essential equipment and resources during a pandemic. Whether governments and health services could have been better prepared for COVID-19 is debatable, but the need for a quickly deployable, and evidence-based, response is urgent and unmet. The next pandemic is not hypothetical—it will happen again—and guidance must be generated now to prevent patients with cancer becoming collateral damage.For more on cancer treatment guidelines during COVID-19 see Comment page 619, and https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/C0119-_Maintaining-cancer-services-_-letter-to-trusts.pdfFor more on changes to cancer care services see https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/928878, and https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/life-hanging-by-a-thread-for-italian-cancer-patients-in-coronavirus-crisisFor more on cancer treatment guidelines during COVID-19 see Comment page 619, and https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/C0119-_Maintaining-cancer-services-_-letter-to-trusts.pdfFor more on changes to cancer care services see https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/928878, and https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/life-hanging-by-a-thread-for-italian-cancer-patients-in-coronavirus-crisisView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Photographee.eu/shutterstockView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Photographee.eu/shutterstock",,LANCET

Baldwin's reminder and warning in the context of civil rights in the mid-20th century USA speak now in the pandemic to communities the world over who are unsure of their governments' allegiances to them. The give-and-take relationship between the state and the individual—perhaps best viewed through the lens of what Enlightenment philosophers termed the social contract—is being strained, its inadequacy exposed, and must surely be remade in the midst of this global health and economic crisis.Governments now ask heavy sacrifices from their people, with around a third of the global population under some form of lockdown. But demonstration that governments are in fact acting to protect the public, for example, through adequately preparing the health system and giving clear advice aimed at saving lives, has been highly variable. Although international comparisons are not straightforward, there are nonetheless encouraging examples of where strong and swift action has succeeded in staving off the worst effects of the virus, be they Germany's quick escalation of testing, New Zealand's elimination strategy, or South Korea's aggressive pursuit of a test-and-trace approach. By contrast, the UK, USA, and Brazil, among others, have been slow to react and haphazard when they did. The serious deficiencies in pandemic planning and response have sparked protests and condemnation and call into question commitment to the most vital interests of the public.Such failures have too often been accompanied by poor transparency and an ingrained resistance to all forms of accountability. In March, when US President Donald Trump was asked by a reporter if he takes responsibility for the delay in making test kits available, he replied “No, I don't take responsibility at all.” And in April, at a daily COVID-19 briefing when UK Home Secretary Priti Patel was asked twice if she would apologise about the shortage of personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers, she responded, “I'm sorry if people feel that there have been failings”, in what seemed to be indifference to the sacrifices being made by health-care workers on behalf of the country and its people.Beyond immediate responses, this pandemic is revealing how a longer-term increase in inequalities and neglect of public services have weakened the ability of societies to deal with external shocks and created new vulnerabilities in a crisis. Racial and ethnic minorities, those with weak employment protections, including migrant workers, and populations without adequate access to affordable health care are among the hardest hit.However, at the same time, COVID-19 is also overturning core values, norms, and rules that sit at the heart of long-standing market-oriented political agendas. The willingness with which nations have put the brakes on their economies to protect lives, coupled with massive increases in public spending and government debt, particularly by conservative administrations, was inconceivable a few months ago. According to one analysis, as of April 23, a staggering 151 countries have planned, introduced, or adapted a total of 684 social protection measures in response to the pandemic.Despite important deficiencies in some responses, in many ways the world is witnessing the setting aside of ideology to address the urgent and fundamental need common to all people—the protection of health. So far, the measures taken have been uneven, short-term, and reactive. But it is hard to imagine that when this pandemic is over, the public will be content to go back to the way things were. That it has taken a crisis of this scale to force the recognition that the basic role of a government is to serve and protect its people—that wellbeing has a higher value than gross domestic product—is a shocking demonstration of how the reciprocal rights and responsibilities that form the basis of so many democratic systems have been hollowed out. The kind of societies that are set to emerge from this pandemic is far from clear, but our interconnectedness and interdependence at local, national, and global levels have never been more undeniable. Nor can the importance of well resourced and well prepared health systems continue to be ignored. A renewed and expanded social contract, one with health at the centre, could well be one legacy of COVID-19.View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Giles Clarke/Getty ImagesView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Giles Clarke/Getty Images",,LANCET

No, something far worse","Every evening we scour those graphs looking for signs that the epidemic is in retreat. New cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). People in hospital with COVID-19. Critical care beds with COVID-19 patients. Daily COVID-19 deaths in hospital. And then the final and bluntly worded “global death comparison”. Those with responsibility for leading us through this emergency have called it “a once in a century global health crisis”. This statement is incorrect on two grounds. First, because we cannot know what the rest of the century will bring. It is highly probable that this current pandemic will be neither the last nor the worst global health crisis of the present century. But second, and more importantly, this global calamity is not a crisis concerning health. It is a crisis about life itself. We have been tempted in recent years to assume the omnipotence of our species. The idea of the Anthropocene places human activity as the dominant influence on the future of life on our planet. Although this newest of geological eras is supposed to underline the harm our species is doing to fragile planetary systems, paradoxically it also asserts our supremacy. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has revealed the hubris of this view. Our species has many reasons to be self-critical about the effects of our way of life on planetary sustainability. But we are only one species among many, and we are certainly not a dominant influence when faced with a virus that can destroy life with such ease and facility.View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 John Moore/Getty ImagesView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 John Moore/Getty ImagesIf this pandemic is a crisis about life itself, what tentative conclusions might we draw from its effects so far on human society? Some clues will be found in Didier Fassin's Life: A Critical User's Manual (2018). Fassin studied medicine in Paris before turning to public health and anthropology. His starting point is the awareness we must all have for the unequal lives around us. That observation invites us to reflect on the value we attach to human life. In trying to answer that question, we somehow have to reconcile “life as a fact of nature and as a fact of experience”. We can view COVID-19 as a biological challenge to understand, treat, and prevent. But we should also understand it as a biographical event in the lives of millions of people. Fassin divides his inquiry into inequality into three parts. First, he identifies forms of life, by which he means “ways of being in the world”. The daily insecurities faced by so many of our fellow citizens draw attention to “the predicament of contemporary democracies, incapable of living up to the principles that constitute the foundation of their very existence”. Second, he discusses an ethics of life. He contrasts the rising legitimacy of those who have a biologically defined disease with the declining legitimacy of lives lived in a particular social setting (such as one of poverty). The physical has prevailed over the political. Fassin calls this ethical trend one of “biolegitimacy”—a legitimacy of life defined in biological terms. Life is reduced purely to its physical expression. There is no room for understanding the political conditions within which life exists. There is no possibility to mobilise public sentiment to defend threats to political lives, lives marked by, for example, inequality. SARS-CoV-2 preferentially afflicts those who are more vulnerable, less well rewarded, and more invisible to those with power. Third, Fassin focuses on the politics of life, the government of populations, and the effects of politics on human lives. He is interested in how the actions of political regimes differentially influence human lives and reinforce the unequal worth of some of those lives in society. The “politics of life”, he writes, “are always politics of inequality”.View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 AFP/Getty ImagesView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 AFP/Getty ImagesView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 John Moore/Getty ImagesView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 John Moore/Getty ImagesSo what must we say? We must say that it is our task to uncover the biographies of those who have lived and died with COVID-19. It is our task to resist the biologicalisation of this disease and instead to insist on a social and political critique of COVID-19. It is our task to understand what this disease means to the lives of those it has afflicted and to use that understanding not only to change our perspective on the world but also to change the world itself. As Fassin concludes, our “critique does not have to choose between militancy and lucidity”.View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Abdulhamid Hosbas/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesView Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Abdulhamid Hosbas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images",,LANCET

It is possible that BCG-Tokyo would be preferable to BCG-Danish.9Ritz N Hanekom WA Robins-Browne R Britton WJ Curtis N Influence of BCG vaccine strain on the immune response and protection against tuberculosis.FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008; 32: 821-841Google ScholarUntil these trials are complete, there are four main reasons why it is very important to adhere to WHO's recommendation that the BCG vaccine is used for COVID-19 only in randomised controlled trials.10WHOBacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination and COVID-19.https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/bacille-calmette-gu%C3%A9rin-(bcg)-vaccination-and-covid-19Date: April 12, 2020Date accessed: April 29, 2020Google Scholar First, the BCG vaccine is already in short supply, and indiscriminate use could jeopardise the supply needed to protect children against tuberculosis in high-risk areas. Second, whether BCG will be effective remains unknown: findings from the ecological studies suggesting less COVID-19 in countries with routine BCG immunisation are weak evidence because they are based on population rather than individual data and are prone to confounding.11Faust L Huddart S MacLean E Svadzian A Universal BCG vaccination and protection against COVID-19: critique of an ecological study.https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/users/36050-emily-maclean/posts/64892-universal-bcg-vaccination-and-protection-against-covid-19-critique-of-an-ecological-studyDate: April 1, 2020Date accessed: April 5, 2020Google Scholar Also, it is unlikely that a BCG vaccine given decades ago in childhood will ameliorate COVID-19 now. One reason for this is that the beneficial off-target effects of the BCG vaccine might be altered by subsequent administration of a different vaccine.1Pollard AJ Finn A Curtis N Non-specific effects of vaccines: plausible and potentially important, but implications uncertain.Arch Dis Child. 2017; 102: 1077-1081Google Scholar Third, if the BCG vaccine is not effective against COVID-19, BCG vaccination could engender a false sense of security. Fourth, careful safety monitoring in randomised trials is needed to guard against the remote possibility that up-regulation of immunity by BCG will exacerbate COVID-19 in a minority of patients with severe disease.If the BCG vaccine or another inducer of trained immunity provides non-specific protection to bridge the gap before a disease-specific vaccine is developed, this would be an important tool in the response to COVID-19 and future pandemics.NC is the lead investigator of the BRACE trial (NCT04327206), and MGN is one of the lead investigators of the BCG-CORONA trial (NCT04328441).

Concerns about the global governance of public health, the need to address weak and fragile health systems, and financing these ambitious goals were all raised and debated.3Bekker LG Ratevosian J Spencer J Piot P Beyrer C Governance for health: the HIV response and general global health.Bull World Health Organ. 2019; 97 (70A): 170Google Scholar Now, 2 years later, humankind faces another viral pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as the causative agent. The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly challenging health systems, national economies, the governance structures of global health, and the many gains we have made in human health and global solidarity.The International AIDS Conferences are among the largest global health events of their kind and bring together scientists, clinicians, other health-care providers, affected community leaders, politicians, human rights advocates, economists, international organisations, advocates, and all the many stakeholders that the HIV pandemic has required for our shared global response. To be responsive to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, AIDS 2020 has become a virtual conference, AIDS 2020: Virtual that will be held on July 6–10, 2020. The IAS and our partners, with support from our donors, are working to build a virtual platform through which to share important findings in HIV science and to host the crucial conversations around resilience, our theme for AIDS 2020: Virtual. AIDS 2020 was to be held in San Francisco and Oakland, CA, USA, still our anchoring hosts, but it will now be a global virtual gathering.COVID-19 had infected more than 2·9 million people as of April 28, 2020,4WHOCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report—99.https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200428-sitrep-99-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=119fc381_2Date: April 28, 2020Date accessed: April 29, 2020Google Scholar and is already the most deadly new pandemic since the emergence of AIDS nearly 40 years ago. To address this pandemic's many interactions with HIV and the populations HIV so disproportionally affects, the IAS announced on April 16, 2020, an expanded conference programme to include the interactions of COVID-19 and HIV in its call for late-breaker abstracts. The IAS is intensely aware of how many of our members worldwide are engaged in the COVID-19 response across the spectrum of science, clinical care, prevention, and policy. Indeed, in many countries some of the leaders of the responses to COVID-19 have backgrounds in HIV. In the USA, for example, the three public health leaders for COVID-19, Anthony Fauci of the US National Institutes of Health, Deborah Birx of the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and Robert Redfield of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are all distinguished HIV researchers and leaders.Yet, we must go further, pressed by the global emergency of COVID-19. The platform IAS is building for AIDS 2020: Virtual offers a unique and timely opportunity to host and support a global virtual conference on COVID-19 itself. As the largest global health conference worldwide, we must address the COVID-19 pandemic and the IAS is compelled to offer our platform to the global health community. In this spirit, we announce that the IAS will host the IAS Virtual COVID-19 Conference, a virtual conference on breaking COVID-19 research, policy analysis, and front-line experience on the final day of AIDS 2020: Virtual.The IAS Virtual COVID-19 Conference at AIDS 2020: Virtual will be the first international gathering on COVID-19 for all the many stakeholders, including affected communities, in the emerging response. There will be special invited COVID-19 sessions and IAS announced today, on April 30, 2020, a call for COVID-19 specific abstracts submissions, including exploratory studies, from researchers, clinicians, and policy makers worldwide; the deadline for COVID-19 specific abstracts submissions is May 25, 2020, and further information can be found on the IAS Virtual COVID-19 Conference website. The selected abstracts will guide sessions addressing the full range of COVID-19 topics, from pathogenesis to clinical care and treatment, vaccines, public health strategies, global preparedness, and human rights. Finally, to ensure full access to COVID-19-specific programming for global communities, those sessions will be made publicly available and free of charge.The HIV response has taught the world a great deal about how to react to a pandemic of enormous scale and high lethality.5Hargreaves J Davey C Group for lessons from pandemic HIV prevention for the COVID-19 responseThree lessons for the COVID-19 response from pandemic HIV.Lancet HIV. 2020;  (published online April 13.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-3018(20)30110-7Google Scholar The IAS Virtual COVID-19 Conference at AIDS 2020: Virtual will bring together the human family to take on this pandemic.

We agree that six main parameters must be considered in predicting the epidemiology—namely, number of initial cases, viral reproduction, isolation delay, tracing probability, asymptomatic transmission (considering a case incubation period of 5·8 days), and subclinical infection.The COVID-19 pneumonia, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), initially broke out in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 was traced to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and is postulated to have bat origin.2Li Q Guan X Wu P et al.Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 1199-1207Google Scholar During the past three months, information has accumulated on the transmissibility and clinical characteristics of this zoonotic pathogen, which are largely mirrored by the six parameters addressed by Hellewell and colleagues. However, several questions have been raised retrospectively regarding the clinical values of their modelling.An initial concern was the definition of outbreak control, which seemed to be the focus of the modelling. A clear definition could have improved interpretation of the modelling work. Control could mean either complete isolation of all infected individuals, or an observed turning point of daily new cases as a result of isolation efforts. Complete isolation is difficult to measure because of asymptomatic infections.3Wang Y Liu Y Liu L Wang X Luo N Ling L Clinical outcome of 55 asymptomatic cases at the time of hospital admission infected with SARS-coronavirus-2 in Shenzhen, China.J Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online March 17.)DOI:10.1093/infdis/jiaa119Google Scholar Another crucial factor is the definition of infection and disease onset, because the success of control in terms of isolating all those infected is related to the delay in symptoms. Clinical manifestations, nucleic acid detection, and radiological approaches can all be used to identify an infection. The routine diagnostic procedure has been detection of fever, followed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection for confirmation, but neither are highly accurate or sensitive,4Lan L Xu D Ye G et al.Positive RT-PCR test results in patients recovered from COVID-19.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Feb 27.)DOI: 10.1001/jama.2020.2783Google Scholar making case identification challenging. Furthermore, more recent data indicate that the case incubation period can range widely, from 0 days to 24 days (mean of 6·4 days),5Wang Y Wang Y Chen Y Qin Q Unique epidemiological and clinical features of the emerging 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) implicate special control measures.J Med Virol. 2020; 92: 568-576Google Scholar related to asymptomatic transmission. A third factor to consider is postdischarge quarantine. Some discharged patients will still carry the virus, as we and others have observed,4Lan L Xu D Ye G et al.Positive RT-PCR test results in patients recovered from COVID-19.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Feb 27.)DOI: 10.1001/jama.2020.2783Google Scholar and these people are potentially a source of infection. Finally, post-isolation travel from countries with ongoing outbreaks can cause an additional, albeit minor, introduction of cases.In Wuhan, daily new cases peaked after 29 days of deploying extensive quarantine measures throughout the city, after which new cases dropped, first steadily and then sharply. We now pose the question: how do these observations support the mathematical modelling?We declare no competing interests.Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contactsFull-TextPDFOpen AccessFeasibility of controlling COVID-19 – Authors' replyFull-TextPDFOpen Access",,LANCET

On 8 March 2020, the number of Italians with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 7375 with a 48% hospitalization rate.

ID:126981,N/A,medical,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention","INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)This topic will discuss the virology, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19. The management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)Issues related to COVID-19 in specific populations are discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)VIROLOGY — Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus in the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (as well as several bat coronaviruses), but in a different clade. The structure of the receptor-binding gene region is very similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and the virus has been shown to use the same receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for cell entry [4]. The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has proposed that this virus be designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [5].The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, another betacoronavirus, appears more distantly related [6,7]. The closest RNA sequence similarity is to two bat coronaviruses, and it appears likely that bats are the primary source; whether COVID-19 virus is transmitted directly from bats or through some other mechanism (eg, through an intermediate host) is unknown [8]. (See ""Coronaviruses"", section on 'Viral serotypes'.)In a phylogenetic analysis of 103 strains of SARS-CoV-2 from China, two different types of SARS-CoV-2 were identified, designated type L (accounting for 70 percent of the strains) and type S (accounting for 30 percent) [9]. The L type predominated during the early days of the epidemic in China, but accounted for a lower proportion of strains outside of Wuhan than in Wuhan. The clinical implications of these findings are uncertain. EPIDEMIOLOGYGeographic distribution — Globally, more than three million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported. Updated case counts in English can be found on the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control websites. An interactive map highlighting confirmed cases throughout the world can be found here.Since the first reports of cases from Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China, at the end of 2019, more than 80,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported in China, with the majority of those from Hubei and surrounding provinces. A joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission estimated that the epidemic in China peaked between late January and early February 2020 [10], and the rate of new cases decreased substantially by early March. However, cases have been reported in all continents, except for Antarctica, and have been steadily rising around the world.In the United States, COVID-19 has been reported in all 50 states, Washington DC, and at least four territories [11]. The cumulative incidence varies by state and likely depends on a number of factors, including population density and demographics, extent of testing and reporting, and timing of mitigation strategies. In the United States, outbreaks in long-term care facilities and homeless shelters have emphasized the risk of exposure and infection in congregate settings [12-14]. (See 'Risk of transmission' below.)Transmission — Understanding of the transmission risk is incomplete. Epidemiologic investigation in Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak identified an initial association with a seafood market that sold live animals, where most patients had worked or visited and which was subsequently closed for disinfection [15]. However, as the outbreak progressed, person-to-person spread became the main mode of transmission. Person-to-personRoute of person-to-person transmission — The exact mode of person-to-person spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. It is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, resembling the spread of influenza. With droplet transmission, virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes; infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) and do not linger in the air. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the airborne route (through particles smaller than droplets that remain in the air over time and distance) under natural conditions has been a controversial issue. One letter to the editor described a study in which SARS-CoV-2 grown in tissue culture remained viable in experimentally generated aerosols for at least three hours [16]; some studies have identified viral RNA in ventilation systems and in air samples of hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19, but cultures for viable virus were not performed in these studies [17-19]. Other studies using high-speed imaging to visualize respiratory exhalations have suggested that respiratory droplets may get carried in a gas cloud and have horizontal trajectories beyond six feet (two meters) with speaking, coughing, or sneezing [20,21]. However, the direct relevance of these findings to the epidemiology of COVID-19 and their clinical implications are unclear. Long-range airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not clearly been documented [22], and in a few reports of health care workers exposed to patients with undiagnosed infection with only contact and droplet precautions, no secondary infections were identified despite the absence of airborne precautions [23,24]. Reflecting the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms, recommendations on airborne precautions in the health care setting vary by location; airborne precautions are universally recommended when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood, and ocular secretions, but the role of these sites in transmission is uncertain [25-29]. In particular, several reports have described detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stool specimens, even after viral RNA could no longer be detected from upper respiratory specimens [28,29], and live virus has been cultured from stool in some cases [26]. Although it would be difficult to confirm, fecal-oral transmission has not been clinically described, and according to a joint WHO-China report, did not appear to be a significant factor in the spread of infection [30]. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood has also been reported in some but not all studies that have tested for it [25,26,29,31]. However, the likelihood of bloodborne transmission (eg, through blood products or needlesticks) appears low; respiratory viruses are generally not transmitted through the bloodborne route, and transfusion-transmitted infection has not been reported for SARS-CoV-2 or for the related MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV [32]. (See ""Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing"", section on 'Emerging infectious disease agents'.)Viral shedding and period of infectivity — The interval during which an individual with COVID-19 is infectious is uncertain. It appears that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted prior to the development of symptoms and throughout the course of illness. However, most data informing this issue are from studies evaluating viral RNA detection from respiratory and other specimens, and detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus. Viral RNA levels from upper respiratory specimens appear to be higher soon after symptom onset compared with later in the illness [33-36]. Additionally, in a study of nine patients with mild COVID-19, infectious virus was isolated from naso/oropharyngeal and sputum specimens during the first week of illness, but not after this interval, despite continued high viral RNA levels at these sites [35]. One modeling study, based on the timing of infection among 77 transmission pairs in China (with a mean serial interval of 5.8 days between the onset of symptoms in each pair) and assumptions about incubation period, suggested infectiousness started 2.3 days prior to symptom onset, peaked 0.7 days before symptom onset, and declined within seven days; however, most patients were isolated following symptom onset, which would reduce the risk of transmission later in illness regardless of infectiousness [36]. These findings raise the possibility that patients might be more infectious in the earlier stage of infection, but additional data are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Nevertheless, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or individuals within the incubation period) has been documented [37-41]. The biologic basis for this is supported by a study of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility, in which infectious virus was cultured from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive upper respiratory tract specimens in presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients as early as six days prior to the development of typical symptoms [42]. However, the extent to which asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission occurs and how much it contributes to the pandemic remain unknown. In an analysis of 157 locally acquired COVID-19 cases in Singapore, transmission during the incubation period was estimated to account for 6.4 percent; in such cases, the exposures occurred one to three days prior to symptom development [43]. Large-scale serologic screening may be able to provide a better sense of the scope of asymptomatic infections and inform epidemiologic analysis; several serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 are under development, and some have been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [44,45]. How long a person remains infectious is also uncertain. The duration of viral shedding is variable; there appears to be a wide range, which may depend on severity of illness [29,35,46-48]. In one study of 21 patients with mild illness (no hypoxia), 90 percent had repeated negative viral RNA tests on nasopharyngeal swabs by 10 days after the onset of symptoms; tests were positive for longer in patients with more severe illness [46]. In contrast, in another study of 56 patients with mild to moderate illness (none required intensive care), the median duration of viral RNA shedding from naso- or oropharyngeal specimens was 24 days, and the longest was 42 days [49]. However, as mentioned above, detectable viral RNA does not always correlate with isolation of infectious virus, and there may be a threshold of viral RNA level below which infectivity is unlikely. In the study of nine patients with mild COVID-19 described above, infectious virus was not detected from respiratory specimens when the viral RNA level was <106 copies/mL [35].The impact of viral RNA detection on infection control precautions is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Risk of transmission — The risk of transmission from an individual with SARS-CoV-2 infection varies by the type and duration of exposure, use of preventive measures, and likely individual factors (eg, the amount of virus in respiratory secretions). Most secondary infections have been described among household contacts, in congregate or health care settings when personal protective equipment was not used (including hospitals [50] and long-term care facilities [12]), and in closed settings (eg, cruise ships [51]). However, reported clusters of cases after social or work gatherings also highlight the risk of transmission through close, non-household contact.Contact tracing in the early stages of epidemics at various locations suggested that most secondary infections were among household contacts, with a secondary attack rate of up to 16 percent [30,52-54]. According to a joint WHO-China report, the rate of secondary COVID-19 in various locations ranged from 1 to 5 percent among tens of thousands of close contacts of confirmed patients in China; most of these occurred within households, with an in-household secondary attack rate of 3 to 10 percent [30]. In the United States, the symptomatic secondary attack rate was 0.45 percent among 445 close contacts of 10 confirmed patients; among household members, the rate was 10.5 percent [52]. In a similar study in Korea, the rates were comparable, with secondary infections in 0.55 percent of all contacts and 7.6 percent of family members [53].Clusters of cases have also been reported following family, work, or social gatherings where close, personal contact can occur [55,56]. As an example, epidemiologic analysis of a cluster of cases in the state of Illinois showed probable transmission through two family gatherings at which communal food was consumed, embraces were shared, and extended face-to-face conversations were exchanged with symptomatic individuals who were later confirmed to have COVID-19 [55].The risk of transmission with more indirect contact (eg, passing someone with infection on the street, handling items that were previously handled by someone with infection) is not well established and is likely low. Environmental contamination — Virus present on contaminated surfaces may be another source of infection if susceptible individuals touch these surfaces and then transfer infectious virus to mucous membranes in the mouth, eyes, or nose. The frequency and relative importance of this type of transmission remain unclear. It may be more likely to be a potential source of infection in settings where there is heavy viral contamination (eg, in an infected individual's household or in health care settings). Extensive SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces in hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19 has been described [17,57]. In a study from Singapore, viral RNA was detected on nearly all surfaces tested (handles, light switches, bed and handrails, interior doors and windows, toilet bowl, sink basin) in the airborne infection isolation room of a patient with symptomatic mild COVID-19 prior to routine cleaning [17]. Viral RNA was not detected on similar surfaces in the rooms of two other symptomatic patients following routine cleaning (with sodium dichloroisocyanurate). Of note, viral RNA detection does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus [35]. It is unknown how long SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces [16,58,59]; other coronaviruses have been tested and may survive on inanimate surfaces for up to six to nine days without disinfection. In a study evaluating the survival of viruses dried on a plastic surface at room temperature, a specimen containing SARS-CoV (a virus closely related to SARS-CoV-2) had detectable infectivity at six but not nine days [59]. However, in a systematic review of similar studies, various disinfectants (including ethanol at concentrations between 62 and 71%) inactivated a number of coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 within one minute [58]. Based on data concerning other coronaviruses, duration of viral persistence on surfaces also likely depends on the ambient temperature, relative humidity, and the size of the initial inoculum [60].These data highlight the importance of environmental disinfection in the home and health care setting. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Environmental disinfection'.)Uncertain risk of animal contact — SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to have originally been transmitted to humans from an animal host, but the ongoing risk of transmission through animal contact is uncertain. There is no evidence suggesting animals (including domesticated animals) are a major source of infection in humans. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described in animals in both natural and experimental settings. There have been rare reports of animals with SARS-CoV-2 infection (including asymptomatic infections in dogs and symptomatic infections in cats) following close contact with a human with COVID-19 [61]. The risk of infection may vary by species. In one study evaluating infection in animals after intranasal viral inoculation, SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently in ferrets and cats; viral replication was also detected in dogs, but they appeared to be less susceptible overall to experimental infection [62]. Pigs and poultry were not susceptible to infection. Given the uncertainty regarding the transmission risk and the apparent susceptibility of some animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that pets be kept away from other animals or people outside of the household and that people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 try to avoid close contact with household pets, as they should with human household members, for the duration of their self-isolation period. There have been no reports of domesticated animals transmitting SARS-CoV-2 infection to humans. Immunity and risk of reinfection — Antibodies to the virus are induced in those who have become infected. Preliminary evidence suggests that some of these antibodies are protective, but this remains to be definitively established. Moreover, it is unknown whether all infected patients mount a protective immune response and how long any protective effect will last.Data on protective immunity following COVID-19 are emerging [34,35,63]. A case series evaluating convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 identified neutralizing activity in plasma of recovered patients that appeared to be transferred to recipients following plasma infusion [63]. Similarly, in another study of 23 patients who recovered from COVID-19, antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in most patients by 14 days following the onset of symptoms; ELISA antibody titers correlated with neutralizing activity [34]. One preliminary study reported that rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 did not develop reinfection following recovery and rechallenge [64]; however, this study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and further confirmation of these findings is needed. Some studies have reported positive RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 following clinical improvement and negative results on two consecutive tests [65,66]. However, these positive tests occurred shortly after the negative tests, were not associated with worsening symptoms, may not represent infectious virus, and likely did not reflect reinfection.As above, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization for tests that qualitatively identify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum or plasma [45]. Should evidence confirm that the presence of these antibodies reflects a protective immune response, serologic screening will be an important tool to understand population immunity and distinguish individuals who are at lower risk for reinfection.CLINICAL FEATURESIncubation period — The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure [67-69].In a study of 1099 patients with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, the median incubation period was four days (interquartile range two to seven days) [68]. Using data from 181 publicly reported, confirmed cases in China with identifiable exposure, one modeling study estimated that symptoms would develop in 2.5 percent of infected individuals within 2.2 days and in 97.5 percent of infected individuals within 11.5 days [70]. The median incubation period in this study was 5.1 days.Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates — The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe [50,69,71-75]. Specifically, in a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity [76]: ●Mild (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in 81 percent.●Severe disease (eg, with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was reported in 14 percent.●Critical disease (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) was reported in 5 percent.●The overall case fatality rate was 2.3 percent; no deaths were reported among noncritical cases. Among hospitalized patients, the proportion of critical or fatal disease is higher [77,78]. In a study that included 2634 patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the New York City area, 14 percent were treated in the intensive care unit and 12 percent received invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality among those receiving mechanical ventilation was 88 percent [77]. However, the analysis was limited to patients who had either been discharged or died during the admission, and these patients represented fewer than half of the total population admitted with COVID-19; thus, the proportion of critically ill patients and the associated mortality rate may not accurately reflect those of the entire hospitalized population. The proportion of severe or fatal infections may also vary by location. According to a joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission, the case fatality rate ranged from 5.8 percent in Wuhan to 0.7 percent in the rest of China [30]. A modeling study suggested that the adjusted case fatality rate in mainland China was 1.4 percent [79]. Most of the fatal cases occurred in patients with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities [47,76]. In Italy, 12 percent of all detected COVID-19 cases and 16 percent of all hospitalized patients were admitted to the intensive care unit; the estimated case fatality rate was 7.2 percent in mid-March [80,81]. In contrast, the estimated case fatality rate in mid-March in South Korea was 0.9 percent [82]. This may be related to distinct demographics of infection; in Italy, the median age of patients with infection was 64 years, whereas in Korea the median age was in the 40s. (See 'Impact of age' below.)Risk factors for severe illness — Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but it predominantly occurs in adults with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities. The impact of age is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Impact of age' below.)Comorbidities that have been associated with severe illness and mortality include (table 1) [47,76,83-85]: ●Cardiovascular disease●Diabetes mellitus●Hypertension●Chronic lung disease●Cancer (in particular hematologic malignancies, lung cancer, and metastatic disease) [86]●Chronic kidney disease●Obesity The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also includes immunocompromising conditions and liver disease as potential risk factors for severe illness [87], although specific data regarding risks associated with these conditions are limited. In a subset of 355 patients who died with COVID-19 in Italy, the mean number of pre-existing comorbidities was 2.7, and only 3 patients had no underlying condition [81]. Among patients with advanced age and medical comorbidities, COVID-19 is frequently severe. For example, in a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak across several long-term care facilities in Washington State, the median age of the 101 facility residents affected was 83 years, and 94 percent had a chronic underlying condition; the hospitalization and preliminary case fatality rates were 55 and 34 percent, respectively [88].Males have comprised a disproportionately high number of deaths in cohorts from China, Italy, and the United States [77,81,89].In a number of states in the United States, black individuals also appear to comprise a disproportionately high number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19, possibly related to underlying socioeconomic disparities [90-94]. Particular laboratory features have also been associated with worse outcomes (table 2). These include [47,95,96]: ●Lymphopenia●Elevated liver enzymes●Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)●Elevated inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein [CRP], ferritin)●Elevated D-dimer (>1 mcg/mL)●Elevated prothrombin time (PT)●Elevated troponin ●Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK)●Acute kidney injuryAs an example, in one study, progressive decline in the lymphocyte count and rise in the D-dimer over time were observed in nonsurvivors compared with more stable levels in survivors [50].Patients with severe disease have also been reported to have higher viral RNA levels in respiratory specimens than those with milder disease [46], although this association was not observed in a different study that measured viral RNA in salivary specimens [34]. Impact of age — Individuals of any age can acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, although adults of middle age and older are most commonly affected, and older adults are more likely to have severe disease. In several cohorts of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, the median age ranged from 49 to 56 years [50,72,73]. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections, 87 percent of patients were between 30 and 79 years old [76]. Similarly, in a modeling study based on data from mainland China, the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 increased with age, with a 1 percent rate for those 20 to 29 years old, 4 percent rate for those 50 to 59 years old, and 18 percent for those older than 80 years [79]. Older age is also associated with increased mortality [76,77,81]. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, case fatality rates were 8 and 15 percent among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older, respectively, in contrast to the 2.3 percent case fatality rate among the entire cohort [76]. Similar findings were reported from Italy, with case fatality rates of 12 and 20 percent among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older, respectively [81].In the United States, 2449 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 12 and March 16, 2020 had age, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) information available [97]; 67 percent of cases were diagnosed in those aged ≥45 years, and, similar to findings from China, mortality was highest among older individuals, with 80 percent of deaths occurring in those aged ≥65 years.Symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported [98-101]. Details of COVID-19 in children are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".) Asymptomatic infections — Asymptomatic infections have been well documented [69,102-108]. Their precise frequency is unknown, but several studies performed in various settings suggest that they are common. As examples:●In a COVID-19 outbreak on a cruise ship where nearly all passengers and staff were screened for SARS-CoV-2, approximately 17 percent of the population on board tested positive as of February 20; about half of the 619 confirmed COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [109]. A modeling study estimated that 18 percent were true asymptomatic cases (ie, did not go on to develop symptoms), although this was based on a number of assumptions, including the incubation period [104]. ●In a smaller COVID-19 outbreak within a skilled nursing facility, 27 of the 48 residents (56 percent) who had a positive screening test were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, but 24 of them ultimately developed symptoms over the next seven days [42]. ●Other studies have reported even higher proportions of asymptomatic cases [14,107]. As an example, in a report of a universal screening program of pregnant women presenting for delivery at two New York hospitals at the height of the pandemic there, 29 of 210 asymptomatic women without fever (14 percent) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal specimen [107]. Four additional women had fever or symptoms and also tested positive. Thus, of 33 women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 29 (88 percent) were asymptomatic on presentation.Even patients with asymptomatic infection may have objective clinical abnormalities [40,106]. As an example, in a study of 24 patients with asymptomatic infection who all underwent chest computed tomography (CT), 50 percent had typical ground-glass opacities or patchy shadowing, and another 20 percent had atypical imaging abnormalities [40]. Five patients developed low-grade fever, with or without other typical symptoms, a few days after diagnosis. In another study of 55 patients with asymptomatic infection identified through contact tracing, 67 percent had CT evidence of pneumonia on admission; only two patients developed hypoxia, and all recovered [106]. Clinical manifestationsInitial presentation — Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging [50,68,72,73]. However, other features, including upper respiratory tract symptoms, myalgias, diarrhea, and smell or taste disorders, are also common (table 3). There are no specific clinical features that can yet reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other viral respiratory infections, although development of dyspnea several days after the onset of initial symptoms is suggestive. (See 'Course and complications' below.) Most studies describing the clinical features of COVID-19 have been performed in hospitalized populations. In a study describing 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, the most common clinical features at the onset of illness were [50]:●Fever in 99 percent●Fatigue in 70 percent●Dry cough in 59 percent●Anorexia in 40 percent●Myalgias in 35 percent●Dyspnea in 31 percent●Sputum production in 27 percentOther cohort studies of patients with confirmed COVID-19 have reported a similar range of clinical findings [50,72,110-112]. However, fever might not be a universal finding on presentation. In one study, fever was reported in almost all patients, but approximately 20 percent had a very low grade fever <100.4°F/38°C [72]. In another study of 1099 patients from Wuhan and other areas in China, fever (defined as an axillary temperature over 99.5°F/37.5°C) was present in only 44 percent on admission but was ultimately noted in 89 percent during the hospitalization [68]. Although not highlighted in the initial cohort studies from China, smell and taste disorders (eg, anosmia and dysgeusia) have also been reported as common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 [113-115]. In a survey of 59 patients with COVID-19 in Italy, 34 percent self-reported either a smell or taste aberration and 19 percent reported both [114]. In a survey of 202 outpatients with mild COVID-19 in Italy, 64 percent reported alterations in smell or taste, and 24 percent reported very severe alterations; smell or taste changes were reported as the only symptom in 3 percent overall and preceded symptoms in another 12 percent [116]. Whether this finding is a distinguishing feature of COVID-19 is uncertain. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea and diarrhea) have also been reported; and in some patients, they may be the presenting complaint [50,72,112,117]. In a systematic review of studies reporting on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with confirmed COVID-19, the pooled prevalence was 18 percent overall, with diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, or abdominal pain reported in 13, 10, and 9 percent, respectively [28]. Other reported symptoms have included headache, sore throat, and rhinorrhea [68,73]. Conjunctivitis has also been described [27].Dermatologic findings in patients with COVID-19 are not well characterized. There have been reports of maculopapular, urticarial, and vesicular eruptions and transient livedo reticularis [118-120]. Reddish-purple nodules on the distal digits similar in appearance to pernio (chilblains) have also been described, mainly in children and young adults with documented or suspected COVID-19, although an association has not been clearly established [120-123].Course and complications — As above, symptomatic infection can range from mild to critical. (See 'Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates' above.)Some patients with initially nonsevere symptoms may progress over the course of a week. In one study of 138 patients hospitalized in Wuhan for pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, dyspnea developed after a median of five days since the onset of symptoms, and hospital admission occurred after a median of seven days of symptoms [50]. In another study, the median time to dyspnea was eight days [72].Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major complication in patients with severe disease and can manifest shortly after the onset of dyspnea. In the study of 138 patients described above, ARDS developed in 20 percent a median of eight days after the onset of symptoms; mechanical ventilation was implemented in 12.3 percent [50]. In another study of 201 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, 41 percent developed ARDS; age greater than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were each associated with ARDS [95]. Other complications have included arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shock [50,89,124,125]. In one study, these were reported in 17, 7, and 9 percent, respectively [50]. In a series of 21 severely ill patients admitted to the ICU in the United States, one-third developed cardiomyopathy [124]. Thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism and acute stroke (even in patients younger than 50 years of age without risk factors), have also been reported [126-131]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome, with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines; these laboratory abnormalities have been associated with critical and fatal illnesses [72,132]. (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.) Guillain-Barré syndrome has also been reported, with onset 5 to 10 days after initial symptoms [133]. According to the WHO, recovery time appears to be around two weeks for mild infections and three to six weeks for severe disease [10].Laboratory findings — Common laboratory findings among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 include lymphopenia, elevated aminotransaminase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, ferritin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) [50,68,112]. Lymphopenia is especially common, even though the total white blood cell count can vary [50,72,73,134]. As an example, in a series of 393 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City, 90 percent had a lymphocyte count <1500/microL; leukocytosis (>10,000/microL) and leukopenia (<4000/microL) were each reported in approximately 15 percent [112].On admission, many patients with pneumonia have normal serum procalcitonin levels; however, in those requiring ICU care, they are more likely to be elevated [50,72,73].Several laboratory features, including high D-dimer levels and more severe lymphopenia, have been associated with mortality [73]. These are discussed elsewhere. (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.)Imaging findings — Chest radiographs may be normal in early or mild disease. In a retrospective study of 64 patients in Hong Kong with documented COVID-19, 20 percent did not have any abnormalities on chest radiograph at any point during the illness [135]. Common abnormal radiograph findings were consolidation and ground glass opacities, with bilateral, peripheral, and lower lung zone distributions; lung involvement increased over the course of illness, with a peak in severity at 10 to 12 days after symptom onset. Although chest CT may be more sensitive than chest radiograph and some chest CT findings may be characteristic of COVID-19, no finding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID-19. In the United States, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends not using chest CT for screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and recommends reserving it for hospitalized patients when needed for management [136]. If CT is performed, the Radiological Society of North America has categorized features as typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19, and has suggested corresponding language for the interpretation report (table 4) [137]. Chest CT in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia [111,138]. Case series have suggested that chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral, have a peripheral distribution, and involve the lower lobes. Less common findings include pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. In a study of 1014 patients in Wuhan who underwent both RT-PCR testing and chest CT for evaluation of COVID-19, a ""positive"" chest CT for COVID-19 (as determined by a consensus of two radiologists) had a sensitivity of 97 percent, using the PCR tests as a reference; however, specificity was only 25 percent [139]. The low specificity may be related to other etiologies causing similar CT findings. In another study comparing chest CTs from 219 patients with COVID-19 in China and 205 patients with other causes of viral pneumonia in the United States, COVID-19 cases were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80 versus 57 percent), ground-glass opacities (91 versus 68 percent), fine reticular opacities (56 versus 22 percent), vascular thickening (59 versus 22 percent), and reverse halo sign (11 versus 1 percent), but less likely to have a central and peripheral distribution (14 versus 35 percent), air bronchogram (14 versus 23 percent), pleural thickening (15 versus 33 percent), pleural effusion (4 versus 39 percent), and lymphadenopathy (2.7 versus 10 percent) [140]. A group of radiologists in that study was able to distinguish COVID-19 with high specificity but moderate sensitivity.In one report of 21 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who did not develop severe respiratory distress, lung abnormalities on chest imaging were most severe approximately 10 days after symptom onset [110]. However, chest CT abnormalities have also been identified in patients prior to the development of symptoms and even prior to the detection of viral RNA from upper respiratory specimens [111,141].Among patients who clinically improve, resolution of radiographic abnormalities may lag behind improvements in fever and hypoxia [142].DIAGNOSISClinical suspicion and criteria for testing — The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with new onset fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea). It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Other consistent symptoms include myalgias, diarrhea, and smell or taste aberrancies (table 3) (see 'Initial presentation' above). Although these syndromes can occur with other viral respiratory illnesses, the likelihood of COVID-19 is increased if the patient:●Resides in or has traveled within the prior 14 days to a location where there is community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; ie, large numbers of cases that cannot be linked to specific transmission chains); in such locations, residence in congregate settings or association with events where clusters of cases have been reported is a particularly high risk for exposure. (See 'Geographic distribution' above and 'Risk of transmission' above.) or●Has had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the prior 14 days, including through work in health care settings. Close contact includes being within approximately six feet (about two meters) of a patient for a prolonged period of time while not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) or having direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing PPE.Patients with suspected COVID-19 who do not need emergency care should be encouraged to call prior to presenting to a health care facility for evaluation. Many patients can be evaluated regarding the need for testing over the phone. For patients in a health care facility, infection control measures should be implemented as soon as the possibility of COVID-19 is suspected. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)The diagnosis cannot be definitively made without microbiologic testing, but limited capacity may preclude testing all patients with suspected COVID-19. Local health departments may have specific criteria for testing. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have suggested priorities for testing (table 5); high-priority individuals include hospitalized patients (especially critically ill patients with unexplained respiratory illness) and symptomatic individuals who are health care workers or first responders, work or reside in congregate living settings, or have risk factors for severe disease [143,144]. Testing criteria suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) can be found in its technical guidance online. These are the same criteria used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk, particularly when no other cause of the symptoms is evident. The management of suspected cases when testing is not available is discussed elsewhere. (See 'COVID-19 testing not readily available' below.)Microbiologic diagnosisRT-PCR to diagnose current infection — The diagnosis of COVID-19 is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [145]. Various RT-PCR assays are used around the world; different assays amplify and detect different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Common gene targets include nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), spike (S), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), as well as regions in the first open reading frame [146]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for many different RT-PCR assays [45]; testing is performed by the CDC, local public health departments, hospital laboratories, and certain commercial reference laboratories. Specimen collection — Upper respiratory samples are the primary specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. In the United States, the CDC recommends collection of one of the following specimens [147]: ●Nasopharyngeal swab specimen, collected by a health care professional ●Oropharyngeal swab specimen, collected by a health care professional ●Nasal swab specimen from the anterior nares, collected by a health care professional or by the patient on-site or at home (in the United States, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization for a home-collection testing kit that can be mailed to the laboratory for testing [148])●Nasal or nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate, collected by a health care professionalExpectorated sputum should be collected from patients with productive cough; induction of sputum is not recommended. A lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage should be collected from patients who are intubated. Additional information on testing and handling of clinical specimens can be found on the CDC website. Infection control practices during specimen collection are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)Interpretation — A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, false-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been well documented. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, we suggest repeating the test. In such cases, the WHO also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if possible [149]. Infection control precautions for COVID-19 should continue while repeat evaluation is being performed. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing and concern for false-negative results, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk (residence in or travel to an area with widespread community transmission or known contact). In such cases, particularly for hospitalized patients who have negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, characteristic laboratory or imaging findings can further support the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and be reasons to maintain infection control precautions. Nevertheless, other potential causes of symptoms should also be considered in patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. The interpretation of an inconclusive or indeterminate result depends on the specific RT-PCR assay performed; the clinician should confer with the performing laboratory about additional testing.The accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 tests have not been systematically evaluated, and the sensitivity of testing likely depends on the precise RT-PCR assay, the type of specimen obtained, the quality of the specimen, and duration of illness at the time of testing. In a study of 51 patients who were hospitalized in China with fever or acute respiratory symptoms and ultimately had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test (mainly on throat swabs), 15 patients (29 percent) had a negative initial test and only were diagnosed by serial testing [150]. In a similar study of 70 patients in Singapore, initial nasopharyngeal testing was negative in 8 patients (11 percent) [151]. In both studies, rare patients were repeatedly negative and only tested positive after four or more tests.The likelihood of a positive upper respiratory RT-PCR may be higher early in the course of illness. One study using a combination of RT-PCR and an immunoglobulin (Ig)M serologic test to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 suggested that RT-PCR positivity rates were >90 percent on days 1 to 3 of illness, <80 percent at day 6, and <50 percent after day 14; however, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the serologic test used was not validated for detection of acute infection and IgM tests are generally prone to false positivity [152].Lower respiratory tract specimens may have higher viral loads and be more likely to yield positive tests than upper respiratory tract specimens [26,31]. In a study of 205 patients with COVID-19 who were sampled at various sites, the highest rates of positive viral RNA tests were reported from bronchoalveolar lavage (95 percent, 14 of 15 specimens) and sputum (72 percent, 72 of 104 specimens), compared with oropharyngeal swab (32 percent, 126 of 398 specimens) [26]. Data from this study suggested that viral RNA levels are higher and more frequently detected in nasal compared with oral specimens, although only eight nasal swabs were tested. Serology to identify prior infection — Serologic tests detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, and those that have been adequately validated can help identify patients who have had COVID-19. Serologic tests may also be able to identify some patients with current infection (particularly those who present late in the course of illness), but they are less likely to be reactive in the first several days to weeks of infection, and thus may have less utility for diagnosis in the acute setting [152-154]. In the United States, several serologic tests have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA for use by laboratories certified to perform moderate- and high-complexity tests [45]. The FDA highlights that serologic tests should not be used as the sole test to diagnose or exclude active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity and specificity of many of these serologic tests are uncertain; a catalog of these tests can be found at centerforhealthsecurity.org.Detectable antibodies generally take several days to weeks to develop. In a study of 173 patients with COVID-19, the median time from symptom onset to antibody detection (with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] that detects antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein) was 12 days for IgM and 14 days for IgG [153]. In the first week since symptom onset, fewer than 40 percent had detectable antibodies; by day 15, IgM and IgG were detectable in 94 and 80 percent, respectively. The accuracy and time to antibody detection vary with the particular test used. Studies evaluating the specificity of serologic tests in a broad population are lacking; in particular, the rate of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses is a potential concern, and IgM tests are prone to false-positive results.Large-scale serologic screening with validated tests may be able to provide a better sense of the scope of the burden of disease (by identifying people who were not diagnosed by PCR or who may have had asymptomatic or subclinical infection) and also identify individuals who may have immunity to infection; serologic correlates of protective immunity, however, have not been defined. (See 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' above and 'Immunity and risk of reinfection' above.)Other tests●Tests that identify SARS-CoV-2 antigen are under development, although rapid antigen tests for respiratory pathogens are typically less sensitive than PCR in detecting viral nucleic acid (see ""Diagnosis of seasonal influenza in adults"", section on 'Rapid antigen tests'). Several manufacturers are selling rapid, point-of-care tests based on antigen testing or antibody detection, but the WHO does not recommend these tests because of accuracy concerns in the absence of validation studies [155].●For safety reasons, specimens from a patient with suspected or documented COVID-19 should not be submitted for viral culture. Testing for other pathogens — If influenza is circulating in the community, it is reasonable to also test for influenza when testing for SARS-CoV-2, as this could have management implications. However, detection of another viral (or bacterial) pathogen does not necessarily rule out SARS-CoV-2 in locations where there is widespread transmission. Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, including influenza, has been described, but the reported frequency is variable [77,156-158].MANAGEMENT — Home management is appropriate for patients with mild infection (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea) or asymptomatic infection who can be adequately isolated in the outpatient setting. Management of such patients should focus on prevention of transmission to others and monitoring for clinical deterioration, which should prompt hospitalization. Management of patients who warrant hospitalization consists of ensuring appropriate infection control and supportive care (including oxygenation and potentially ventilatory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome). Investigational approaches are also being evaluated, and should be used in the setting of a clinical trial, whenever available. Management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)PREVENTIONInfection control in the health care setting — In locations where community transmission is widespread, preventive strategies for all individuals in a health care setting are warranted to reduce potential exposures. Additional measures are warranted for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Infection control in the health care setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Preventing exposure in the community — If community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is present, residents should be encouraged to practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave home. In particular, individuals should avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals. The following general measures are additionally recommended to reduce transmission of infection:●Diligent hand washing, particularly after touching surfaces in public. Use of hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol is a reasonable alternative if the hands are not visibly dirty. ●Respiratory hygiene (eg, covering the cough or sneeze).●Avoiding touching the face (in particular eyes, nose, and mouth). The American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests that people not wear contact lenses, because they make people touch their eyes more frequently [159].●Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that are frequently touched. The CDC has issued guidance on disinfection in the home setting; a list of EPA-registered products can be found here. These measures should be followed by all individuals, but should be emphasized for older adults and individuals with chronic medical conditions, in particular. For people without respiratory symptoms, the WHO does not recommend wearing a medical mask in the community, since it does not decrease the importance of other general measures to prevent infection and may result in unnecessary cost and supply problems; the WHO also emphasizes that medical masks should be prioritized for health care workers [160]. Recommendations on use of masks by healthy members of the community vary by country [161]. In the United States, the CDC updated its recommendations in early April to advise individuals to wear a cloth face covering (eg, homemade masks or bandanas) when in public settings where social distancing is difficult to achieve, especially in areas with substantial community transmission [162]. Individuals should be counseled to avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth when removing the covering, practice hand hygiene after handling it, and launder it routinely. Clinicians should emphasize that the face covering does not diminish the importance of other preventive measures, such as social distancing and hand hygiene. The rationale for the face covering is primarily to contain secretions of and prevent transmission from individuals who have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection. The CDC also reiterates that the face covering recommendation does not include medical masks, which should be reserved for health care workers.Individuals who are caring for patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 at home should also wear a face cover when in the same room as that patient (if the patient cannot wear a face cover). Individuals who develop an acute respiratory illness (eg, with fever and/or respiratory symptoms) should be encouraged to self-isolate at home for the duration of the illness and wear a face cover if they have to be around other people. Some may warrant evaluation for COVID-19. (See 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing' above.) The efficacy of masks in containing SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)The CDC has included recommended measures to prevent spread in the community on its website. Managing asymptomatic individuals with potential exposure — In areas where SARS-CoV-2 is prevalent, all residents should be encouraged to stay alert for symptoms and practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave the home. In the United States, the CDC suggests this approach for all residents [163]. For those returning from international travel (including cruise ship travel) and those who have had close contact with a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (including during the 48 hours prior to that patient developing symptoms), the CDC also suggests [163,164]:●Self-quarantine at home for 14 days following the last exposure, with maintenance of at least six feet (two meters) from others at all times.●Avoiding contact with individuals at high risk for severe illness (unless they are household members with the same exposure). (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.)●Twice-daily temperature checks with monitoring for fever, cough, or dyspnea. If they develop such clinical manifestations, they should continue to stay at home away from other household members and contact their medical providers. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients'.) For asymptomatic individuals who are critical infrastructure workers, the CDC has provided guidance on returning to work during the 14-day post-exposure period with symptom and temperature monitoring, mask use, social distancing, and workspace disinfection [165].Management of health care workers with a documented exposure is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Return to work for health care workers'.) Global public health measures — On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread. The WHO has indicated three priorities for countries: protecting health workers, engaging communities to protect those at highest risk of severe disease (eg, older adults and those with medical comorbidities), and supporting vulnerable countries in containing infection [10].The WHO does not recommend international travel restrictions but does acknowledge that movement restriction may be temporarily useful in some settings. The WHO advises exit screening for international travelers from areas with ongoing transmission of COVID-19 virus to identify individuals with fever, cough, or potential high-risk exposure [166,167]. Many countries also perform entry screening (eg, temperature, assessment for signs and symptoms). More detailed travel information is available on the WHO website. In the United States, the CDC currently recommends that individuals avoid all nonessential international travel and nonessential travel from some domestic locations [168]. Because risk of travel changes rapidly, travelers should check United States government websites for possible restrictions. Other public health measures that have been variably employed in different countries include social distancing and stay-at-home ordinances, aggressive contact tracing and quarantine, restricting traffic to or from areas of very high prevalence, and policies on face masks or coverings in public. In an epidemiologic study, a number of interventions (implementation of travel restrictions in and around Wuhan with home quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing in public, followed by centralized quarantine for all cases and contacts, followed by proactive symptom screening for all residents) were associated with progressive reductions in the incidence of confirmed cases in Wuhan and a decrease in the effective reproduction number (ie, the average number of secondary cases for each case in a population made up of both susceptible and nonsusceptible individuals) from >3 prior to the interventions to 0.3 after them [169]. Investigational approachesVaccines — Numerous vaccine candidates are being evaluated for prevention of COVID-19 [170]. The first vaccine to undergo preliminary study in humans in the United States uses a messenger RNA platform to result in expression of the viral spike protein in order to induce an immune response [171]. There is also interest in Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunization for prevention of COVID-19, and clinical trials are underway to evaluate its use among health care workers [172]. Studies have suggested that, although its primary purpose is prevention of tuberculosis, BCG immunization induces a nonspecific immune response that may have protective effects against non-mycobacterial, including viral, infections [173,174]. Any impact of BCG immunization on COVID-19 specifically is unknown. The WHO recommends BCG vaccination not be used for prevention or lessening the severity of COVID-19, pending further data [175]. Post-exposure prophylaxis — Clinical trials are also being conducted in the United States and elsewhere to evaluate the safety and efficacy of post-exposure drug prophylaxis against COVID-19 [176,177]. No agent is known to be effective in preventing infection; we suggest post-exposure prophylaxis not be attempted outside a clinical trial. SPECIAL SITUATIONSPregnant and breastfeeding women — The general approach to prevention, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 is largely similar to that in nonpregnant individuals. Issues specific to pregnant and breastfeeding women are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".) Children — Symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported [98-101]. Details of COVID-19 in children are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".) COVID-19 testing not readily available — In some cases, testing for COVID-19 may not be accessible, particularly for individuals who have a compatible but mild illness that does not warrant hospitalization and do not have a known COVID-19 exposure or high-risk travel history. In the United States, there is limited official guidance for this situation, and the approach may depend on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the area. If the clinician has sufficient concern for possible COVID-19 (eg, there is community transmission and there is no other apparent cause for the symptoms), it is reasonable to assume the patient had COVID-19 and advise the patient to self-isolate at home (if hospitalization is not warranted) and alert the clinician about worsening symptoms. Outpatient management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.) SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, now designated SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan, a city in China. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Since the first reports of COVID-19, infection has spread to include more than three million confirmed cases worldwide, prompting the WHO to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms who reside in or have traveled to areas with community transmission or who have had recent close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. Clinicians should also be aware of the possibility of COVID-19 in patients with severe respiratory illness when no other etiology can be identified. Other symptoms have also been associated with COVID-19 (table 3). Limitations in testing capacity may preclude testing all patients with suspected infection; suggested priorities include hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals who are health care workers or first responders, work or reside in congregate living settings, or have risk factors for severe disease (table 5). (See 'Clinical features' above and 'Diagnosis' above.)●The microbiologic diagnosis is made by a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. An upper respiratory tract specimen is the preferred test specimen. Because of limited testing capacity and concern for false-negative testing, the diagnosis is often presumptively made based on consistent clinical and epidemiologic features. Serologic tests can help identify individuals with prior infection but have less utility in the first weeks of infection. (See 'Microbiologic diagnosis' above.)●Upon suspicion of COVID-19, infection control measures should be implemented. Infection control in health care settings is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.) ●Management consists of supportive care, although investigational approaches are being evaluated. Home management is appropriate for patients with mild illness who can be adequately isolated in the outpatient setting. A minority of patients need critical care. Home, hospital, and intensive care unit management of patients with COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, individuals should be advised to wash hands diligently, practice respiratory hygiene (eg, cover their cough), and avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals, if possible. Social distancing is recommended in locations that have community transmission. In some locations, face coverings are advised in public settings. (See 'Preventing exposure in the community' above.)●Interim guidance has been issued by the WHO and by the CDC. These are updated on an ongoing basis.

ID:127429,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.This topic will discuss the management of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. Our approach to hospital management is based on limited data and evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management, which may differ from our approach. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and, in the United States, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3] and the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel [4]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)The management of patients with COVID-19 in the home and outpatient setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Issues related to COVID-19 in specific populations are discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EVALUATION — Our objective in the evaluation of hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 is to evaluate for features associated with severe illness (table 1) and identify organ dysfunction or other comorbidities that could complicate potential therapy. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Although we check several laboratory tests to evaluate patients with documented or suspected COVID-19, the prognostic value of many of them remains uncertain, and other institutions may not include all these tests. At least initially, we check the following laboratory studies daily:●Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, with a focus on the total lymphocyte count trend●Complete metabolic panel●Creatine kinase (CK)●C-reactive protein (CRP)●FerritinInitially, we check the following studies every other day (or daily if elevated or in the intensive care unit):●Prothrombin time (PT)/partial prothrombin time (PTT)/fibrinogen●D-dimerWe check the following studies at baseline and repeat them if abnormal or with clinical worsening:●Lactate dehydrogenase, repeated daily if elevated●Troponin, repeated every two to three days if elevated●Electrocardiogram (ECG), with at least one repeat test after starting any QTc-prolonging agent (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Monitoring for QT prolongation')We also check hepatitis B virus serologies, hepatitis C virus antibody, and HIV antigen/antibody testing if these have not been previously performed. Chronic viral hepatitis could affect interpretation of transaminase elevations and exacerbate hepatotoxicity of certain therapies; underlying HIV infection may change the assessment of the patient's risk for deterioration and would warrant initiation of antiretroviral therapy. We check a portable chest radiograph in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; for most patients, this is sufficient for initial evaluation of pulmonary complications and extent of lung involvement. Although chest computed tomography (CT) was frequently used in China for evaluation of patients with COVID-19, we reserve chest CT for circumstances that might change clinical management, in part to minimize infection control issues related to transport. This is consistent with recommendations from the American College of Radiology [5]. Although certain characteristic chest CT findings may be seen in COVID-19, they cannot reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other causes of viral pneumonia. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.)We do not routinely obtain echocardiograms on patients with COVID-19; developments that might warrant an echocardiogram include increasing troponin levels with hemodynamic compromise or other cardiovascular findings suggestive of cardiomyopathy. Acute myocardial injury has been a described complication of COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'When to suspect myocardial injury and key considerations'.) Secondary bacterial infection has not been a frequently reported feature of COVID-19; if this is suspected (eg, based on chest imaging or sudden deterioration), we check two sets of blood cultures and sputum Gram stain and culture. Procalcitonin can be checked to assess the risk of secondary bacterial infection; however, since elevated procalcitonin levels have been reported as COVID-19 progresses, they may be less specific for bacterial infection later in the disease course [6-9]. As above, the prognostic value of the results of some of the tests we use to evaluate patients with COVID-19 is uncertain, and the optimal use of these markers remains unknown. As an example, although some clinicians also note the potential utility of troponin levels to inform the risk of severe COVID-19 and provide a baseline for comparison in patients who develop manifestations of myocardial injury [10], others reserve troponin level testing for patients who have specific clinical suspicion for acute coronary syndrome [11]. One concern is that the results could lead to unnecessary use of medical resources (eg, serial troponins, electrocardiograms and cardiology consults for elevated troponin). If troponin is checked in a patient with COVID-19, clinicians should be aware that an elevated level does not necessarily indicate acute coronary syndrome. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'Troponin'.) GENERAL MANAGEMENT ISSUESEmpiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia in select patients — For patients with documented COVID-19, we do not routinely administer empiric therapy for bacterial pneumonia. Data are limited, but bacterial superinfection does not appear to be a prominent feature of COVID-19. However, since the clinical features of COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from bacterial pneumonia, empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia is reasonable when the diagnosis is uncertain. Empiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia may also be reasonable in patients with documented COVID-19 if there is clinical suspicion for it (eg, new fever after defervescence with new consolidation on chest imaging). If empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated, we attempt to make a microbial diagnosis (eg, through sputum Gram stain and culture, urinary antigen testing) and reevaluate the need to continue antibiotic therapy daily. In such settings, a low procalcitonin may be helpful to suggest against a bacterial pneumonia; however, elevated procalcitonin has been described in COVID-19, particularly late in the course of illness, and does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection [6-9]. (See ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"", section on 'Guiding antibiotic therapy'.)The diagnosis of and empiric antibiotic regimens for community-acquired and health care-associated pneumonia are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Overview of community-acquired pneumonia in adults"" and ""Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"" and ""Treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"".)Prevention of and evaluation for venous thromboembolism — We favor pharmacologic prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19, consistent with recommendations from several expert societies [12-14]. Dosing and selection of pharmacologic agents to prevent venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis'.)Several studies suggest a high rate of thromboembolic complications among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly those who are critically ill. The thromboembolic risk with COVID-19 as well as the evaluation for and management of these complications are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'VTE' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation'.)Uncertainty about NSAID use — There are minimal data informing the risks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the setting of COVID-19. We use acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose; this is consistent with the general approach to fever reduction in adults (see ""Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults"", section on 'Treating fever'). We do not discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions, unless there are other reasons to stop them (eg, renal injury, gastrointestinal bleeding). Concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young patients who received NSAIDs early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [15,16]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO, and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel do not recommend NSAIDs be avoided when clinically indicated [4,17,18]. Avoiding nebulized medications — Inhaled medications should be administered by metered dose inhaler, whenever possible, rather than through a nebulizer, to avoid the risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 through nebulization. If a nebulizer must be used, appropriate infection control precautions should be taken. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)'.)Limited role of glucocorticoids — We agree with recommendations by the WHO and CDC that systemic glucocorticoids not be used in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications (eg, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) [19,20].For those without pre-existing pulmonary disease, we also avoid inhaled glucocorticoids. The use of inhaled glucocorticoids in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the setting of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Acute exacerbations of asthma in adults: Emergency department and inpatient management"", section on 'Advice related to covid-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in management of SARS, there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm [21]. (See ""Treatment of seasonal influenza in adults"", section on 'Adjunctive therapies' and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Treatment and prevention"", section on 'Treatment'.)The approach to glucocorticoids among critically ill patients with COVID-19 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'.)Managing chronic medicationsACE inhibitors/ARBs — Patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents if there is no other reason for discontinuation (eg, hypotension, acute kidney injury). This approach is supported by multiple guidelines panels [22-26]. There has been speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes, but there is no clinical evidence that supports such an association. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)Conversely, ARBs have also been proposed to have potential protective effects based on their mechanism of action [27], but there is no empiric evidence to support this hypothesis. We do not use ACE inhibitors or ARBs as potential COVID-19 treatment.Statins — We make a point of continuing statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are already taking them. A high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 have underlying cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and other indications for use of statins. Moreover, acute cardiac injury is a reported complication of COVID-19. Although clinicians may be concerned about hepatotoxicity from statins, particularly since transaminase elevations are common in COVID-19, most evidence indicates that liver injury from statins is uncommon. (See ""Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration"", section on 'Hepatic dysfunction'.) Whether statins could impact the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clear. Statins are known inhibitors of the MYD88 pathway, which results in marked inflammation, and have been reported to stabilize MYD88 levels in the setting of external stress in vitro and in animal studies [28]. Dysregulation of MYD88 has been noted and associated with poor outcomes in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, but this has not been described with SARS-CoV-2. Although statins might be of benefit in patients with COVID-19, more data are needed.Immunomodulatory agents — Use of immunosuppressing agents has been associated with increased risk for severe disease with other respiratory viruses, and the decision to discontinue prednisone, biologics, or other immunosuppressive drugs in the setting of COVID-19 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"", section on 'Management of cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure'.) For individuals with underlying conditions who require treatment with these agents and do not have suspected or documented COVID-19, there is no evidence that routinely discontinuing treatment is of any benefit. In addition, discontinuing these medications may result in loss of response when the agent is reintroduced. The approach of continuing immunomodulatory therapy in patients without infection is supported by statements from dermatology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology societies [29-32].Infection control — Infection control is an essential component of management of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.) COVID-19-SPECIFIC THERAPYSpecific treatments — Several treatments are being evaluated for COVID-19. Although some of these treatments are clinically available for other indications, their use for COVID-19 remains investigational.Remdesivir — Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro [33]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for hospitalized children and adults with severe COVID-19 (SpO2 ≤94 percent on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) [34]. The suggested adult dose is 200 mg intravenously on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for 10 days total in patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO and 5 days total in other patients (with extension to 10 days if there is no clinical improvement). Remdesivir is not recommended in patients with an alanine aminotransferase ≥5 times the upper limit of normal (and should be discontinued if it rises above this level during treatment or if there are other signs of liver injury). The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in the setting of renal impairment are uncertain, and it is prepared in a cyclodextrin vehicle that accumulates in renal impairment and may be toxic; thus, remdesivir is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Data from comparative, randomized trials are needed to define the effect of remdesivir in COVID-19; these data are emerging but remain limited and mixed. Overall, if preliminary results are confirmed, there is likely some clinical benefit to remdesivir, although the patient population most likely to benefit remains uncertain.The United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced preliminary results of a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir among 1063 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and evidence of lung involvement [35]. On interim analysis, remdesivir resulted in a faster time to recovery, defined as being discharged from the hospital or no longer requiring supplemental oxygen (median 11 versus 15 days with placebo, p<0.001). There was also a trend towards lower mortality that was not statistically significant (8 versus 11.6 percent with placebo, p = 0.059). Final analysis and peer review of these data are pending. In contrast, in a double-blind randomized trial in China of 237 patients with severe COVID-19 (hypoxia and radiographically confirmed pneumonia), time to clinical improvement was not statistically different with remdesivir compared with placebo for 10 days (median 21 versus 23 days; hazard ratio for improvement 1.23 [95% CI 0.87-1.75]) [36]. Clinical improvement was defined as discharge from the hospital or a two-point improvement on a six-point clinical score that ranges from death to mechanical ventilation to lower levels of oxygen support to discharge. This study only included one patient who was on mechanical ventilation at baseline. Mortality at 28 days was also similar with remdesivir or placebo (14 versus 13 percent); there was also no difference in time to viral clearance. Among patients who had received treatment within 10 days of symptom onset, there were trends towards lower mortality and more rapid clinical improvement with remdesivir, but these differences were not statistically significant. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events (including gastrointestinal symptoms, aminotransferase or bilirubin elevations, and worsened cardiopulmonary status) in 12 percent, compared with 5 percent in the placebo group. Several limitations reduce confidence in the finding of no effect; concomitant therapies (lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon alpha-2b, and/or corticosteroids) were used by most study participants, patients in the remdesivir group had a higher proportion of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease), and the study was stopped early for poor enrollment (the target enrollment pre-determined to demonstrate effect was 435 patients). Early data suggest that 5 days of remdesivir result in similar outcomes as 10. In a preliminary report from the manufacturer of a randomized, open-label trial among nearly 400 patients with severe COVID-19 who were not on mechanical ventilation, the rates of clinical recovery and discharge by day 14 were not statistically different when remdesivir was given for 5 days (65 and 60 percent, respectively) versus 10 days (54 and 52 percent, respectively) [37]. Mortality rates at day 14 were 8 and 11 percent with 5 and 10 days of treatment, respectively, and varied by geographic location.Use of remdesivir has also been described in several case series [38-40]. In one multicenter, multinational series, 53 patients with severe COVID-19 and hypoxia received compassionate-use remdesivir for up to 10 days and had a median of 18 days of follow-up; 68 percent had clinical improvement (decreased requirement for oxygen support or hospital discharge), and 13 percent died [40]. Of the 30 patients who were mechanically ventilated at baseline, 17 (57 percent) were extubated, and three of four patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were taken off it. Reported side effects include nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations. In a preliminary report from a trial of remdesivir among patients with severe COVID-19, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations occurred in 7 percent and led to drug discontinuation in 3 percent [37]. Other adverse events described in patients who received remdesivir include worsening kidney injury, multiple organ failure, and worsened cardiopulmonary status [36,40]. Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine — There are insufficient data thus far to know whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has a role in treatment of COVID-19. For this reason, we strongly recommend that patients should be referred to a clinical trial whenever possible. In the United States, the FDA has issued an emergency use authorization to allow the use of these agents in adolescents or adults hospitalized for COVID-19 when participation in clinical trials is not feasible [41]. When a clinical trial is not available, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine may be a reasonable option in carefully selected hospitalized patients with or at risk for severe disease who have no access to clinical trials, have no underlying risk for QTc prolongation, and will be monitored closely for adverse events. If drugs are used for COVID-19 outside a clinical trial, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) encourages creation of a registry, when possible, to systematically evaluate their safety and efficacy [42]. Additionally, if hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is used outside of a clinical trial, the potential for adverse effects should be carefully assessed. In particular, these agents can prolong the QT interval and should be avoided in patients with prolonged baseline QTc interval or on other agents that affect cardiac conduction, and otherwise should be used with close monitoring. The American College of Cardiology has suggested QTc monitoring parameters in this setting [43]. QTc monitoring in this setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Monitoring for QT prolongation'.)Other risks (eg, retinopathy or cardiomyopathy) are primarily with longer-term use and higher cumulative doses, but should be a consideration when deciding to use these agents. Catastrophic outcomes have been reported with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine overdose; no individual should use these medications without medical supervision [44,45]. (See ""Antimalarial drugs in the treatment of rheumatic disease"", section on 'Adverse effects'.)When these agents are used, the optimal dose is uncertain. When we use hydroxychloroquine, we prescribe 400 mg twice daily orally for two doses, then 400 mg daily orally. We give the regimen for five days; however, if patients have improved enough to be discharged from the hospital prior to finishing the course, it is reasonable to stop the regimen at the time of discharge, because of its long half-life, in order to maintain availability of the agent for others. We do not routinely use azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 (see 'Others' below). For chloroquine, the FDA emergency use authorization has suggested a dose of 1 g on day 1, then 500 mg daily for four to seven days total, depending on clinical response [41]. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, although hydroxychloroquine appears to have more potent antiviral activity [46]. Published clinical data on either of these agents are limited and have methodologic problems. In an open-label study of 36 adults with COVID-19, use of hydroxychloroquine (200 mg three times per day for 10 days) was associated with a higher rate of undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal specimens at day 6 compared with no specific treatment (70 versus 12.5 percent) [47], but there were substantial methodologic problems with this study that cast doubt on the conclusions [48]. In a randomized trial of 30 adults with COVID-19 in Shanghai, the proportion of patients with nasopharyngeal viral clearance at day 7 was not different with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily for 5 days) compared with standard of care, and one patient in the hydroxychloroquine group progressed to severe disease; interferon and other antiviral agents were used in both arms, which could be confounding factors [49]. One trial comparing two doses of chloroquine for COVID-19 was stopped early because of a higher mortality rate in the high-dose group, highlighting the potential for toxicity [50].Much of the clinical data evaluating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have not yet been published in peer-reviewed journals; these data are mixed and do not suggest a clear benefit. In one unpublished randomized trial of patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia without hypoxia, adding hydroxychloroquine to standard of care resulted in a slightly faster time to improvement in fever, cough, and chest imaging findings and possibly a lower likelihood of progression to severe disease [51]. In another unpublished randomized trial of hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, adding hydroxychloroquine to standard of care did not improve the rate of SARS-CoV-2 clearance or symptomatic improvement by 28 days [52]. With both trials, there are methodologic concerns, including concomitant co-therapies, baseline differences between the groups, and lack of blinding or placebo control. The evidence on the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Others' below.)A number of clinical trials are underway in China and elsewhere to evaluate the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 [53]. Convalescent plasma — In the United States, the FDA is accepting investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 [54]; pathways for use through these applications include clinical trials, expanded access programs, and emergency individual use. Use of convalescent plasma has been described in case series [55-57]. One case series described administration of plasma from donors who had completely recovered from COVID-19 to five patients with severe COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation and persistently high viral titers despite investigational antiviral treatment [55]. The patients had decreased nasopharyngeal viral load, decreased disease severity score, and improved oxygenation by 12 days after transfusion. However, these findings do not establish a causal effect, and the efficacy of convalescent plasma remains unknown. In another case series of six patients who received convalescent plasma late in the course of illness, five died despite SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance within three days of treatment [57]. Finding appropriate donors and establishing testing to confirm neutralizing activity of plasma may be logistical challenges. In the United States, the American Red Cross is helping to collect and distribute convalescent plasma throughout the country [58]. (See ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)The FDA is also facilitating the evaluation of hyperimmune globulin for patients with COVID-19 [58]. IL-6 pathway inhibitors — Tocilizumab is an interleukin (IL)-6 receptor inhibitor used for rheumatic diseases and cytokine release syndrome. Elevated IL-6 levels have been described in patients with severe COVID-19, and case reports have described good outcomes with tocilizumab [59-63], but systematic evaluation of the clinical impact of tocilizumab on COVID-19 has not yet been published. Treatment guidelines from China's National Health Commission include the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab for patients with severe COVID-19 and elevated IL-6 levels. Tocilizumab, as well as sarilumab and siltuximab, which also target the IL-6 pathway, are being evaluated in clinical trials. Others●Favipiravir – Favipiravir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor that is available in some Asian countries for treatment of influenza, and it is being evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 in the United States. ●Interferon beta – There are no direct data evaluating the effect of interferon beta on SARS-CoV-2. However, interferon beta effectively reduces MERS-CoV in vitro and has resulted in good outcomes in an animal model of MERS-CoV infection [64-66].●Azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine – We do not use azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19. Although one study suggested the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine was associated with more rapid resolution of virus detection than hydroxychloroquine alone [47], this result should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size, substantial methodologic concerns [48], and unclear biologic plausibility. Another small observational study in patients with more severe illness did not suggest rapid viral RNA clearance with the combination [67]. Both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine are associated with QTc prolongation, and combined use may potentiate this adverse effect. ●Lopinavir-ritonavir – This combined protease inhibitor, which has primarily been used for HIV infection, has in vitro activity against the SARS-CoV [68] and appears to have some activity against MERS-CoV in animal studies [64]. However, lopinavir-ritonavir appears to have minimal to no role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of a clinical trial. The WHO has launched a multinational trial to further evaluate remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir with and without interferon beta [69]. Results from a randomized trial do not demonstrate a clear benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir. In a randomized trial of 199 patients with severe COVID-19, the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir (400/100 mg) twice daily for 14 days to standard care did not decrease the time to clinical improvement compared with standard care alone [70]. There was a trend towards decreased mortality with lopinavir-ritonavir (19 versus 25 percent), and the numerical difference in mortality was greater among those who were randomized within 12 days of symptom onset, but neither difference was statistically significant. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 decline was similar in the group that received lopinavir-ritonavir and the group that did not. Lopinavir-ritonavir was stopped early in 14 percent because of adverse effects. If lopinavir-ritonavir is used, the patient's HIV status should be known. If the patient has HIV, lopinavir-ritonavir should be used as a standard combination antiretroviral regimen. Many other agents with known or putative antiviral or immunomodulating effects have been proposed for use in patients with COVID-19 [71-75], and some are in preclinical or clinical evaluation. Use of these agents for COVID-19 should be limited to clinical trials; their efficacy has not been proven, and extensive off-label use may result in excess toxicity and critical shortages of drugs for proven indications. A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org, as well as on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. Approach — The optimal approach to treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Although some trial data suggest a benefit with remdesivir, these data are very preliminary and have not been formally peer reviewed or reported, and there are otherwise no therapies that have clearly proven effective; for most potential therapies, evidence for their use comes primarily from observational case series and anecdotal use based on in vitro or extrapolated indirect evidence.Thus, when available, we strongly recommend enrollment into a well-controlled clinical trial. Our approach is consistent with recommendations from expert groups in the United States. The IDSA recommends that COVID-19-specific therapy be given in the context of a clinical trial and additionally recommends certain therapies (including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and tocilizumab) only be administered in the context of a clinical trial because of a greater level of uncertainty or potential for toxicity [42]. Similarly, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel notes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any antiviral or immune-based therapy and specifically recommends against using certain therapies (including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, interferons, and Janus kinase inhibitors) outside the context of a clinical trial [4].A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org, as well as on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. We use a risk-based approach to try to enroll those patients who may be most likely to benefit. The approach is dependent on local availability of clinical trials and may not be universally applicable. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management.Defining disease severity — Mild disease is characterized by fever, malaise, cough, upper respiratory symptoms, and/or less common features of COVID-19, in the absence of dyspnea. Most of these patients do not need hospitalization. If patients develop dyspnea, that raises concern that they have at least moderate severity disease, and these patients often warrant hospitalization. Patients can have infiltrates on chest imaging and still be considered to have moderate disease, but the presence of any of the following features indicates severe disease: ●Hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤93 percent on room air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg)●Tachypnea (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute) or respiratory distress●More than 50 percent involvement of the lung parenchyma on chest imagingThese features were used in China to characterize severe disease in a large cohort of patients [76] and are consistent with the United States NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel definition of severe infection [4]. We also treat patients who have certain laboratory abnormalities (table 1) similar to patients who have severe disease, because these abnormalities have been associated with disease progression in several studies.Nonsevere disease — For most patients with nonsevere disease, we suggest supportive care only, with close monitoring for clinical worsening. If they develop features of severe disease (eg, hypoxia, tachypnea, or respiratory distress (see 'Defining disease severity' above)), or if they have any laboratory features associated with disease progression (table 1), we treat them as described below. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' below.)Some clinical trials may be available for patients with nonsevere disease. If so, we prioritize patients who have epidemiologic risk factors associated with development of severe illness (table 2). We generally do not treat patients with nonsevere disease with experimental agents outside the context of a clinical trial.Severe (including critical) disease — For hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 who have severe disease or have laboratory risk factors for disease progression (table 1), we recommend referral to a clinical trial of remdesivir, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, or other agents. (See 'Remdesivir' above and 'Convalescent plasma' above and 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above.)For patients with severe COVID-19 in the United States, remdesivir may be available through the FDA's emergency use authorization, and convalescent plasma may also be available through the FDA's investigational new drug application or expanded access program [54]. Additionally, features similar to cytokine release syndrome (eg, persistent fevers, elevated IL-6 and other cytokines, and elevated ferritin, D-dimer, and other inflammatory markers) have been associated with severe and fatal disease in patients with COVID-19 [59,60]. In patients with such features, the use of IL-6 pathway inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, siltuximab, and sarilumab, has been proposed to disrupt this proinflammatory response and improve outcomes, but published data are limited. Clinicians should explore the availability of clinical trials of IL-6 inhibitors for such patients at their location. (See 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors' above.) The optimal timing for implementation of these therapies is unknown. Until more data are available, it remains uncertain which patients would benefit most (if at all) from any of them and how best to allocate potentially limited clinical trial slots. There are insufficient data to know whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has a role in treatment of COVID-19; thus we strongly recommend that patients be referred to a clinical trial whenever possible. When a clinical trial is not available, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity. If drugs are used for COVID-19 outside a clinical trial, the IDSA encourages creation of a registry, when possible, to systematically evaluate their safety and efficacy [42]. (See 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above.)MANAGEMENT OF HYPOXIA, ARDS, AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS — Patients with severe disease often need oxygenation support. High-flow oxygen and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation have been used, but the safety of these measures is uncertain, and they should be considered aerosol-generating procedures that warrant specific isolation precautions. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Respiratory care of the nonintubated patient'.) Some patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and warrant intubation with mechanical ventilation. Management of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and other critical care issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".) In addition to ARDS, other complications of infection include arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, thromboembolic events, and shock. Management of these complications is discussed elsewhere. ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Acute kidney injury'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)INSTITUTIONAL PROTOCOLS — Several academic medical institutions in the United States have developed COVID-19 management protocols that are publicly available. Given the paucity of high-quality clinical evidence on the management of COVID-19, the safety and efficacy of these strategies are uncertain: ●Brigham and Women's Hospital●Massachusetts General Hospital●Michigan Medicine●Nebraska Medicine●Penn Medicine●University of Washington MedicinePartners in Health has also released resources for clinicians and organizations in resource-limited settings. SPECIAL SITUATIONSPregnant and breastfeeding women — The management of pregnant and breastfeeding women with COVID-19 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Pregnant and breastfeeding women'.)People with HIV — Data on the impact of HIV infection on the natural history of COVID-19 are limited [77]. However, many of the comorbid conditions associated with severe COVID-19 (eg, cardiovascular disease) occur frequently among patients with HIV, and these, in addition to CD4 cell count, should be considered in risk stratification. Additionally, drug interactions with antiretroviral agents are important to assess before starting any new therapies. Otherwise, the management of COVID-19 in patients with HIV is the same as in patients without HIV; HIV should not be a reason to exclude a patient from clinical trials or other interventions [78]. Lopinavir-ritonavir is being used in trials for patients with COVID-19, although data from one randomized trial do not suggest a benefit [70]. If a patient with HIV is not on a protease inhibitor-containing regimen, it should not be changed to include a protease inhibitor outside the context of a clinical trial and without consultation with an expert in the management of HIV [79].SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019; it has subsequently spread rapidly, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The optimal approach to treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Our approach is based on limited data and evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Many patients with known or suspected COVID-19 have mild disease that does not warrant hospital-level care. Having such patients recover at home is preferred, as it prevents additional potential exposures in the health care setting and reduces burden on the health care system. Identification of patients who can be managed in the outpatient setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●The evaluation of hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 should assess for features associated with severe illness and identify organ dysfunction or other comorbidities that could complicate potential therapy (table 2). (See 'Evaluation' above.)●Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. COVID-19 has been associated with thromboembolic complications. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●There are minimal data informing the risks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the setting of COVID-19. We suggest acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, if possible (Grade 2C). If NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose. We do not discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions if there are no other reasons to stop them. (See 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' above.)●Specific concern for COVID-19 should not impact the decision to start or stop angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). People who are on an ACE inhibitor or ARB for another indication should not stop their medication. There are minimal data informing the risks or benefits of these medications in the setting of COVID-19. (See 'ACE inhibitors/ARBs' above.)●We make a point of continuing statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are already taking them. (See 'Statins' above.)●The optimal use of COVID-19-specific therapy is uncertain; very preliminary, unpublished trial data suggest a benefit of remdesivir, but no other agent has clearly proven effective. For most potential therapies, evidence on their use is low quality. For this reason, patients should be referred to clinical trials whenever possible. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management. (See 'Approach' above.)•For patients with nonsevere disease who have no laboratory features associated with severe disease (table 1), care is primarily supportive, with close monitoring for disease progression. If a clinical trial is available for such patients, we prioritize those with advanced age (eg, >65 years) and other comorbidities associated with risk of progressive disease (table 2). (See 'Defining disease severity' above and 'Nonsevere disease' above.)•For patients with severe (including critical) disease or with laboratory features associated with severe disease (table 1), we strongly recommend referral to a clinical trial of remdesivir, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, or other agents (Grade 1C). (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' above and 'Remdesivir' above and 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above and 'Convalescent plasma' above.)When a clinical trial is not available, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity (Grade 2C). We do not use azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' above and 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above.)•For critically ill patients who have features similar to cytokine release syndrome, interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors have been proposed to disrupt the proinflammatory response. Clinical trials of IL-6 inhibitors are underway at some locations. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' above.) •We suggest not using lopinavir-ritonavir for COVID-19 therapy outside of a clinical trial (Grade 2B).●Patients with severe disease often need oxygenation support. Some patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and warrant intubation with mechanical ventilation. This is discussed in detail elsewhere.

ID:127488,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)This topic will discuss aspects of COVID-19 that are specific to children. More general aspects of the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management in adults, and prevention of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses are discussed separately.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronaviruses"".)●(See ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"".)●(See ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The epidemiology of COVID-19 is discussed in detail separately. This section focuses on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in children. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Epidemiology'.) Can children get COVID-19? — Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less commonly than adults [4-9]. In a systematic literature review (from January 1 through March 18, 2020), children accounted for 1 to 5 percent of diagnosed COVID-19 cases [10].Although surveillance definitions and criteria for testing have changed over time and geographically, the proportion of cases that have occurred in children from various countries (eg, China, South Korea, Italy, and the United States) are typically within this range [7,11-14].As of April 2, 2020, among the 149,760 laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 1.7 percent were in children <18 years; approximately 70 percent of these cases were from New York City, the rest of New York state, and New Jersey [7]. Approximately 90 percent of cases were associated with household or community exposure, and 10 percent were associated with travel. In retrospective studies of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from China, the household secondary attack rate among pediatric contacts has ranged from 4 to 7 percent [15,16]. Transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)The age distribution of cases in the United States was as follows [7]:●<1 year – 15 percent●1 to 4 years – 11 percent●5 to 9 years – 15 percent●10 to 14 years – 27 percent●15 to 17 years – 32 percentAlthough infants <1 year of age accounted for 15 percent of confirmed cases, the proportion of all cases that have occurred in infants (0.27 percent) is less than the proportion of the United States population that is <1 year of age [7].Among adult patients with COVID-19 in the United States, emerging data suggest that COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minority groups, perhaps related to underlying health conditions and economic and social conditions (eg, living in densely populated areas, multigenerational households, employment in essential industries, lack of paid sick leave, access to medical care) [17,18]. Race and ethnicity data among children with COVID-19 are lacking. Additional information related to COVID-19 activity in the United States (eg, outpatient visits, hospitalization) is available through the CDC's COVIDView.Can SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted through breast milk or during infant feeding? — It is unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk. The only report of testing found no virus in the maternal milk of six patients [19]. However, droplet transmission could occur through close contact during feeding (breastfeeding or bottle feeding). Strategies to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during infant feeding are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)Can SARS-CoV-2 be acquired in utero? — Issues related to COVID-19 in pregnancy, including in utero transmission, are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSAre the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than adults? — The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults, but fewer children than adults with documented infection report symptoms [7,8]. COVID-19 appears to be milder in children than in adults, although severe cases have been reported [9,20]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?' below.)Among 2572 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children <18 years reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by April 2, 2020, the median age was 11 years (range 0 to 17 years); 57 percent of cases were in boys [7]. In case series from China, the median age of affected children was approximately 7 years (range 1 day to 18 years); boys were affected slightly more often than girls (57 to 60 percent of cases) [4,5].Fever and cough are the most common reported symptoms in children [5,7]. In the case series from the United States, complete information about symptoms was available for 291 children; 56 percent had fever, 54 percent had cough, and 13 percent has shortness of breath; 73 percent of children had at least one of these symptoms [7]. In young infants, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause fever without any other manifestations, including respiratory symptoms and signs [9,21].In another series of 1391 children evaluated for COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital, 171 (12 percent) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (via identification of RNA) [5]. Approximately 16 percent of children with confirmed infection were asymptomatic, 19 percent had upper respiratory infection, and 65 percent had pneumonia. Fever was the most common symptom, occurring at some point of illness in approximately 42 percent. Other common symptoms in this case series included cough (49 percent) and pharyngeal erythema (46 percent). Less common symptoms included fatigue, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, diarrhea, and vomiting. Similar clinical manifestations have been reported in smaller case series from China [22]. Some children presented with only gastrointestinal symptoms [4]. Additional symptoms that have been reported in adults include chills or shaking chills, myalgia, headache, and new loss of taste or smell [23].Laboratory findings in children with confirmed infection from Wuhan were variable. Approximately one-quarter had white blood cell count <5.5 x 109/L (5500/microL) and 3.5 percent had lymphocyte count <1.2 x 109/L (1200/microL) [5]. Procalcitonin was elevated (>46 pg/mL) in 64 percent and C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated (>10 mg/L) in 20 percent.Chest radiographs may be unremarkable or demonstrate bilateral consolidation [24,25]. In a series of 171 children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, findings on chest computed tomography included ground glass opacity in 33 percent, local patchy shadowing in 19 percent, bilateral patchy shadowing in 12 percent, and interstitial abnormalities in 1 percent [5]. Radiographic findings may be present before symptoms [26,27]. In a study of eight Italian children hospitalized with documented COVID-19, findings on lung ultrasonography included subpleural consolidations and individual or confluent B lines [28]. These findings were concordant with radiographic findings in seven of the eight patients. They are similar to findings in adult patients with COVID-19. (See ""Bedside pleural ultrasonography: Equipment, technique, and the identification of pleural effusion and pneumothorax"", section on 'B lines and lung consolidation' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19? — Although severe cases of COVID-19 in children, including fatal cases, have been reported, most children appear to have mild or moderate disease and recover within one to two weeks of disease onset [4-7,22,29-35].Infants <1 year of age and children with certain serious underlying conditions appear to be at greater risk for severe disease, although robust evidence associating underlying conditions with severe illness in children is lacking [7,36,37]. Among 345 children from the United States with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and complete information about underlying conditions, 23 percent had an underlying condition. The most commonly reported underlying conditions were [7]:●Chronic pulmonary disease (including moderate to severe asthma)●Cardiovascular disease●Immunosuppression (eg, related to cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplant, high doses of glucocorticoids)Other medical conditions that may increase the risk of severe disease in children based on data from adults include [35,36,38,39]:●Chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis●Chronic liver disease (eg, chronic hepatitis)●Pregnancy●Endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus)●Severe obesity (body mass index ≥40 kg/m2) In a series of 2135 children from China that included 728 children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease, approximately 55 percent of all cases were mild or asymptomatic, 40 percent of cases were moderate (eg, clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia without hypoxemia), 5 percent of cases were severe (eg, dyspnea, central cyanosis, hypoxemia), and <1 percent were critical (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock) [4]. Among the 376 infants <1 year of age with available information, approximately 11 percent had severe or critical disease. These findings should be interpreted with caution; many of the severe and critical cases were not laboratory confirmed and may have been caused by other respiratory infections. In addition, they may not be generalizable to other settings with different testing criteria and/or capabilities.There have been rare reports of children with COVID-19 and clinical features that are similar to those of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease (eg, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, myocarditis) and laboratory findings associated with increased inflammation (eg, elevated CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and ferritin) [40,41]. (See ""Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Invasive group A streptococcal infection and toxic shock syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"", section on 'Toxic shock syndrome' and ""Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease"".)Why COVID-19 appears to be less common and severe in children than in adults is unclear. Some considerations are a less vigorous immune response to the virus in children versus adults; cytokine storm is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infections [42,43]. Another explanation is that viral interference in the respiratory tract of young children leads to a lower viral load in children. Finally, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, which may be expressed differently in the respiratory tract of children compared to adults [4,10,44].How often do children with COVID-19 require hospitalization? — A minority of children with COVID-19 require hospitalization, and very few require intensive care [5,7,45]. Hospitalization and intensive care admission were more common among infants <1 year of age and children with underlying conditions. (See 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?' above.)Among 2572 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children <18 years reported to the CDC by April 2, 2020, the estimated rate of hospitalization ranged from 6 to 20 percent, and the estimated rate of intensive care ranged from 0.58 to 2 percent [7]. In another series of 171 children from China with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, three children required intensive care and mechanical ventilation; all had coexisting conditions (one each with hydronephrosis, leukemia, and intussusception) [5]. By March 8, 2020, 87 percent of children had been discharged from the hospital, and one child died four weeks after admission (a 10-month old with concomitant intussusception who developed multiorgan failure). In a study from the Lombardy region of Italy, only 4 of 1591 patients (<1 percent) admitted to intensive care units with COVID-19 were younger than 20 years [45]. How should I evaluate a child with pharyngitis during the pandemic? — Given concerns SARS-CoV-2 may be spread from the upper airway of symptomatic or asymptomatic children [46], the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests avoidance of examination of the oropharynx unless it is essential [47]. When examination of the oropharynx is necessary (including obtaining oropharyngeal swabs), personal protective equipment should be worn, whether or not the child has symptoms compatible with COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)APPROACH TO DIAGNOSISWhat are the criteria for testing for COVID-19 in children? — Criteria for testing for COVID-19 vary geographically. In the United States, guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Infectious Diseases Society of America (table 1) may be adapted by state and local health departments depending upon test availability [48,49].Testing criteria suggested by the World Health Organization can be found in its technical guidance online. These are the same criteria used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Guidance for testing in other countries is discussed separately. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Although children with fever and no additional symptoms are not considered a high priority group for testing (table 1), testing young infants who require hospital admission for possible invasive bacterial infection may be warranted to prevent transmission in the hospital setting, given that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been detected in young infants with fever as the only manifestation [21]. (See ""Febrile infant (younger than 90 days of age): Management"", section on 'Management'.)Laboratory tests for COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Detection of other respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in nasopharyngeal specimens does not exclude COVID-19 [35,43,50-53]. In one study, 8 of 20 children positive for SARS-CoV-2 were also positive for other common respiratory pathogens [54].MANAGEMENTInvestigational therapies — Although several medications, such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir, are being investigated as treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), none is licensed for this indication or available without approval for compassionate use in children younger than 18 years [55]. These and other investigational agents should be used only under the supervision of a health care provider; misuse of nonpharmaceutical forms of the investigational agents (eg, chloroquine phosphate, which is used in home aquariums; ivermectin intended for animals) may lead to severe toxicity, including death [56-58]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)The effectiveness and safety of infusing plasma from individuals who have fully recovered from COVID-19 into patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 is being studied in patients >18 years of age [59]. Similar studies are being organized for infants and children. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)Should NSAIDs be avoided? — The uncertainty about the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Inpatient management of children with COVID-19 — Children with COVID-19 and severe or critical lower respiratory tract disease generally require hospital admission. Severe disease is defined by a new requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline without new or increased need for ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive) [37]. Critical disease is defined by new or increased need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, sepsis, multiorgan failure, or rapidly worsening clinical trajectory.Supportive care is the mainstay of therapy for children with severe or critical COVID-19. Most children with severe disease will improve with supportive care [37].The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society has endorsed multicenter initial guidance on the use of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 [37]. Additional guidelines for inpatient treatment, including guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, are provided separately. (See 'Society guideline links' below.) We agree with recommendations from the multicenter panel that antiviral therapy for COVID-19 should be reserved for children with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and occur in the context of a clinical trial [37]. Decisions to use antiviral therapy should be individualized according to disease severity, clinical trajectory, and underlying conditions that may increase the risk for progression.The multicenter guidance suggests remdesivir as the preferred agent [37]. Hydroxychloroquine (without azithromycin) is an alternative if remdesivir is not available or the patient is not a candidate for remdesivir.The panel was divided regarding the use of lopinavir-ritonavir and recommended against combination lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin. (See 'Investigational therapies' above.)Outpatient management of children with COVID-19Telephone triage for children — The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides guidance for telephone triage of children with possible COVID-19. How should children be managed at home? — Children with documented or suspected COVID-19 and mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, pharyngitis, other respiratory symptoms) generally should be managed at home unless they have a chronic condition that increases their risk of severe disease.Management is focused on prevention of transmission to others (ie, isolation), monitoring for clinical deterioration, and supportive care. Some evidence from a cluster of cases in France suggests that children may not transmit SARS-CoV-2 as well as other age groups, perhaps related to viral interference [60]. The CDC and World Health Organization provide additional guidance on what to do if you (or your child) is sick [61,62]. (See 'Prevention of transmission' below.)●Monitoring for clinical deterioration – Caregivers of children who are managed at home should be counseled about symptoms of clinical deterioration, which may occur suddenly after approximately one week of symptoms and should prompt urgent re-evaluation [63]. These include [61,62,64,65]:•Severe breathlessness, difficulty breathing (for infants: grunting, inability to breastfeed)•Chest pain or pressure•Blue lips or face•Findings associated with shock (eg, cold, clammy, mottled skin; new confusion; difficulty arousing; substantially reduced urine output)•For infants: grunting, central cyanosis, inability to feed●Symptomatic and supportive care – Symptomatic care for COVID-19 in the outpatient setting is similar to that for other upper respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical syndromes:•Upper respiratory tract infection (see ""The common cold in children: Management and prevention"", section on 'Symptomatic therapy') •Pharyngitis (see ""Acute pharyngitis in children and adolescents: Symptomatic treatment"", section on 'Symptomatic treatment')•Acute gastroenteritis (see ""Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Management and prevention"", section on 'Management')The management of fever in children, including indications for treatment, are discussed separately. (See ""Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management"", section on 'Management of fever'.)When can home isolation be discontinued? — The optimal duration of home isolation is uncertain. The CDC has issued recommendations on discontinuation of home isolation, which include both test-based and nontest-based strategies [66,67]. The choice of strategy depends upon the patient population (eg, immunocompromised versus nonimmunocompromised), the availability of testing supplies, and access to testing.PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSIONFrom infected mother to newborn — Prevention of transmission from infected mother to newborn after delivery is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Postpartum care'.)From children with documented or suspected COVID-19During cardiopulmonary resuscitation — Prevention of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires changes to algorithms for basic and standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including: ●Donning personal protective equipment before entering the room and scene ●Limiting personnel in the patient room to four people; video monitors (if available) can be used for some roles that can be performed outside the room (eg, the ""recorder"")●Engaging the intubator who is most likely to succeed on the first pass ●Consideration of using mechanical cardiopulmonary devices for adults and adolescents if they meet weight and height criteria●Prioritizing oxygenation and ventilation strategies with lower aerosolization risk (eg, using a high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filter, if available for all ventilation) (table 2)●Intubating early with a cuffed tube, if possible●Pausing chest compressions to intubateAdditional interim guidance and updated algorithms are available from the Guidelines-Resuscitation task force of the American Heart Association, in collaboration with other specialty societies [68], and other professional societies [69]. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Hygiene and social distancing — Prevention of transmission focuses on hygiene and social distancing. This includes [61,62,70]:●Having friends or family members bring necessary items to the home (to be retrieved outside)●Having the child (and other sick family members) wear a mask if leaving the home cannot be avoided●As much as possible, keeping ill family members ≥6 feet away from other people, especially family members who are ≥65 years of age or have serious medical conditionsIf such separation is not possible, have the ill family member wear a facemask when they are in the same room or vehicle as other people.●Keeping ill family members separated from pets in the household●Having family members who have fever or cough sleep in separate rooms and use separate bathrooms●Avoiding sharing items (eg, pillows, blankets, utensils, cups)Additional information about how to care for people with documented, suspected, or possible COVID-19 at home is available from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization [61,62].Disinfection — Disinfection of frequently touched surfaces is also important, as discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Environmental disinfection'.)For asymptomatic childrenShould routine health supervision appointments be rescheduled? — During the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefits of well-visits should be balanced with the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and other communicable illnesses, within the context of patient population and office environment [71-73]. When clinicians or practices are unable to provide well-child visits to all of the patients in their practice, the CDC and AAP encourage prioritization of newborn care and vaccination of children through 24 months of age [73,74]. Disruption of immunization services increases the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses [75]. Adherence to recommendations for infants born to women who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or whose HBsAg status is unknown is particularly important for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus, especially if the delivery occurs at an unplanned facility or is attended by staff who are not knowledgeable about managing infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive [76]. (See ""Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview"", section on 'Benefits of vaccines' and ""Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents"", section on 'Routine infant immunization'.)Scheduling, home visits, telemedicine, office space, and/or office locations can be used to keep well children and children who are ill or possibly ill separated (eg, scheduling well-visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon, seeing children for sick visits in a different part of the clinic, designated examination rooms, or at a different office site [or practice] than children for well-visits) [71,77-79].The AAP provides information and resources about telemedicine, including information about state-by-state payer policies.Use of cloth face masks — The CDC recommends that individuals ≥2 years of age wear a cloth face covering (eg, homemade masks or bandanas) when they are in public settings where social distancing may be difficult to achieve (eg, grocery stores, clinician offices), especially in areas with substantial community transmission [80]. Cloth masks are not recommended for children <2 years of age because of concerns about suffocation [81]. The AAP provides additional information about cloth masks for children, including tips for increasing proper wearing and use. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.)Should play dates and playgrounds be avoided? — Given the possibility of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from asymptomatic individuals (or presymptomatic individuals within the incubation period) [4,26,82-89], the CDC recommends that children not have play dates with children from other households and that when playing outside, they remain ≥6 feet from people from other households [90]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.)The CDC provides information about how to safely remain physically active at parks and recreational facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.Hand sanitizer safety — Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is safe for use in children when the sanitizer is used according to the information on the Drug Facts label; there is no cause for concern if children eat or lick their hands after the hand sanitizer has fully dried [91]. However, because ingestion of even a small amount of liquid hand sanitizer can cause alcohol poisoning in children (including hypoglycemia), children younger than six years should be supervised when using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be kept out of the reach and sight of children [92]. (See ""Ethanol intoxication in children: Epidemiology, estimation of toxicity, and toxic effects"" and ""Ethanol intoxication in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and management"".)SPECIAL POPULATIONSChildren with asthma — Considerations related to COVID-19 in children with asthma include the safety of glucocorticoid and nebulized medications. These considerations are discussed separately. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic'.)Children with special health care needs — The AAP provides information about how to keep children with special health care needs safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.OTHER ISSUES●What type of infant formula can be substituted if the usual formula is not available? – The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) provides advice for providers and families if infant formula is not available.●What are the effects of prolonged home confinement? – Although prolonged home confinement may provide an opportunity to enhance parent-child relationships, it may adversely affect children's physical and mental health [93-101]. They may be less physically active, spend more time with electronic devices, and eat a poorer quality diet. Mental health stressors include fear of infection, boredom, and social isolation. In a survey of primary school students from Hubei province in China after being restricted to home for a mean of 35 days, the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety (approximately 20 percent for each) was greater than that in other surveys [100]. School closures associated with health emergencies have been associated with increased risk of violence and vulnerability [96,102]. Vulnerable children and adolescents (eg, those who are homeless or in foster care, have a history of maltreatment, are sexual or gender minorities) are at particular risk for violence and adverse mental health effects [101]. Adverse mental and physical health effects can be mitigated and parent-child relations enhanced through parental role-modeling of healthy behaviors, involving children in family activities, promotion of self-discipline and self-sufficiency skills, and having direct, developmentally appropriate conversations with children about the pandemic [93,98,103-105].Clinicians should consider the potential for violence and look for signs of parental stress, irritability, depression, and/or harsh responses to child behaviors during each clinical encounter [102]. They should ask about parent stress levels, methods to manage stress, social supports, and substance use. Clinicians can offer coping strategies (eg, deep breathing, calling a friend or family member), resources, and/or referrals to mental health providers to families who may benefit from these interventions. •Resources related to child care and prevention of violence during the COVID-19 pandemic include:-AAP tips for parents experiencing stress over COVID-19-Child Care Aware of America-Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children-The National Child Traumatic Stress Network•Resources for talking with children about COVID-19 are available from multiple professional groups and others, including:-The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry-The AAP: Talking to children about COVID-19-Coronavirus: A book for children.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or email these topics to your patients.

Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (See 'Introduction' above.)●Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less frequently than adults. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●COVID-19 in children is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported, including cases with clinical features similar to toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease. In case series, the most common symptoms in children are fever and cough. Other symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, diarrhea, and vomiting. Additional symptoms that have been reported in adults include chills or shaking chills, myalgia, headache, and new loss of taste or smell. Laboratory findings are often normal but may include leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and elevated procalcitonin or C-reactive protein. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)●Criteria for testing for COVID-19 vary geographically.

ID:127828,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Psychiatric issues,"INTRODUCTION — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have reached pandemic scale worldwide in 2020 [1]. The disease is associated with multiple psychiatric problems in clinicians who care for patients with COVID-19 and suspected cases [2,3]. In addition, COVID-19 may precipitate anxiety, depression, and sleep problems in patients with COVID-19 and may adversely affect patients with established psychiatric disorders. This topic addresses the epidemiology and management of psychiatric issues that are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Other topics discuss COVID-19 per se and related issues arising in different specialties.EPIDEMIOLOGY — A limited number of studies describe the prevalence of mental health sequelae associated with COVID-19. Clinicians — Mental health symptoms and disorders can occur and persist in clinicians exposed to COVID-19 [3]. As an example, one cross-sectional study used self-report instruments to assess hospital-based physicians and nurses (total n >1200) in China from January 29 to February 3, 2020 [2]. The prevalence of moderate to severe psychiatric symptoms was as follows:●Anxiety – 12 percent●Depression – 15 percent●Insomnia – 8 percent●Distress – 35 percentIn addition, roughly one-quarter to one-third of clinicians had mild symptoms. Another cross-sectional study assessed nearly 300 hospital-based physicians and nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in Singapore from February 19 to March 13, 2020, using self-report screening instruments [4]. Relatively few clinicians screened positive for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (approximately 5 to 10), which the authors attributed to better preparedness of the clinicians based upon their previous experience with the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic.Risk factors for psychiatric problems in clinicians who care for patients with COVID-19 include increased proximity to affected patients and infection hotspots. One study found that symptoms of any severity were most likely to occur in health care workers having the greatest direct contact with patients (eg, nurses, most of whom were women) [2]. Based upon studies of the 2003 SARS epidemic, COVID-19 related psychiatric problems arising in clinicians may persist beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. In a follow-up study of hospital employees (n = 549) who were exposed to the SARS epidemic in Beijing, self-report assessments three years later indicated that moderate to severe depressive symptoms were present in 23 percent [5]. In addition, perceived risk related to SARS during the epidemic and quarantining during the epidemic were each associated with higher levels of depression at follow-up.Patients with COVID-19 — Few data are available regarding psychiatric problems in patients with COVID-19. However, based upon studies conducted during and after prior epidemics, we anticipate that many patients with COVID-19 will develop anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, PTSD, and substance use disorders [6,7]. As an example, small studies of the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong identified multiple acute problems which persisted:●At the peak of the epidemic, a prospective study enrolled 79 patients with SARS, including 30 infected health care workers (primarily nurses), and 145 healthy controls [8]. Self-reported stress was greater among the infected patients than controls, as were negative psychological effects such as dysphoria, impaired sleep, poor concentration, and impaired judgement. However, most patients and controls also reported positive psychological effects such as awareness of hygiene, physical state, and current affairs. ●One year after the SARS epidemic, a study enrolled 96 individuals who survived SARS infection (including 33 health care workers) and 112 healthy controls [9]. Self-reported stress was greater among the SARS survivors than controls, and greater among health care worker SARS survivors than non-health care worker survivors. In addition, moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were present in approximately 33 percent of all survivors; anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were greater in females than males, and greater in health care worker SARS survivors than non-health care worker survivors.In addition, COVID-19 appears to affect central nervous system function, which may indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are likely to occur in some patients. A retrospective chart review of patients with COVID-19 (n = 214) found that central nervous system manifestations (eg, dizziness, headache, or impaired consciousness) occurred in 25 percent [10].Patients with existing psychiatric illnesses — We anticipate that many patients with existing mental disorders (prior to COVID-19) will be adversely impacted by the psychological effects of COVID-19, due in part to loneliness and economic hardships arising from physical distancing [3,6,11,12]. Patients with anxiety disorders and depressive disorders may be susceptible to the continuous media reporting about the pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding its eventual outcome. In addition, the psychological effects of quarantine can be negative, including anger, confusion, and PTSD symptoms, and these effects may be long-lasting [13]. Patients with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and homelessness are especially likely to suffer from the pandemic, being at risk not only for COVID-19 based upon their social circumstances, but also more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses that put them at risk for poorer health outcomes once infected [14,15].ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS — Assessment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and insomnia are discussed separately: ●(See ""Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia in adults"".)MANAGEMENT — Psychiatric issues related to COVID-19 can occur in multiple populations, including clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 or suspected cases, patients with COVID-19, and patients with established psychiatric disorders prior to COVID-19. In addition, family members of clinicians and patients may develop psychiatric symptoms or disorders. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder that are associated with COVID-19 should follow recommendations for treating the general population of patients with these disorders and are discussed separately. ●(See ""Approach to treating generalized anxiety disorder in adults"".)●(See ""Approach to treating panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults"".)●(See ""Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"".)●(See ""Approach to treating posttraumatic stress disorder in adults"".)●(See ""Overview of the treatment of insomnia in adults"".)General approach — For individuals who experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder, stepped care may be an efficacious and cost-effective approach to providing care [16]. According to this approach, monitoring mental health problems is paramount. Surveillance for domestic violence and child abuse, both of which are predicted to increase during mandated stay-at-home orders, is also critical [16]. Individuals with low levels of symptoms are provided with self-help materials pertinent to their symptoms and concerns and are eligible to speak with a mental health professional if they have additional or persistent concerns. Health care workers in particular are likely to benefit from private, on-demand access to mental health professionals who can address sources of anxiety, distress, and other emotions related to caring for patients [17,18]. Individuals with moderate to severe symptoms can be treated by their primary care provider or referred to a mental health specialist.If feasible, psychiatric care should be administered by computer or telephone rather than face-to-face [14]. Patient contact through voice or voice plus video may be superior to text messages and emails [6]. When face-to-face visits are necessary, personal protective equipment (eg, masks) should be used and care should ideally be administered to individuals rather than groups.Psychiatrists may be asked to consult on patients receiving pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 and should therefore be familiar with some of the medications currently being used. As an example, hydroxychloroquine, which is an antimalarial drug that is frequently used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients (and undergoing clinical trials), is associated with psychiatric side-effects such as mood and anxiety disturbances, insomnia, and more rarely, psychosis. Specific interactions of psychiatric medications with other medications may be determined using the Lexicomp drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. Specific medications that are being evaluated for COVID-19 are described separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Specific treatments'.)Physical distancing, which is widely encouraged to decelerate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within the general public and “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 cases, will result in loneliness for some individuals, particularly those living alone, including the elderly. For those individuals who can avail themselves of digital technology, this may serve as a bridge for social connectedness and should be encouraged [6,19]. In the context of physical distancing, most inpatient facilities have restricted or suspended visits by families and friends [20].Addressing stressors — Potential sources of anxiety and distress that should be addressed include [17,18]:  ●Access to personal protective equipment●Risk of self-exposure and infection●Risk of exposing others to infection●Access to testing●Access to up-to-date, accurate information about COVID-19●Access to childcare during school closures●Increased and taxing workloads●Moral dilemmas and moral injury arising from situations such as deciding how to allocate insufficient resources, inadvertently placing others in danger, and implementing clinical decisions by others that one thinks are contrary to best practices●Loss of control/vulnerability ●Availability and use of support from colleagues and managers●Patient deathsBased upon a study of clinicians in public hospital emergency departments (n = 466) in Hong Kong during the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic [21], the most frequent coping strategies included accepting the reality of the stressor, taking action to circumvent the stressor, and viewing the situation in a more positive light and attempting to grow from the situation.A follow-up study of hospital employees who were exposed to the 2003 SARS epidemic in Beijing (n = 549) found that higher levels of altruistic acceptance of risk during the outbreak (eg, “I want to help the patients and accept the risk”) were associated with lower levels of self-reported depressive symptoms three years later [5]. Quarantine — A review of 24 studies that examined the adverse psychological impact of quarantine suggested the following steps to mitigate the negative effects [13]: ●Explain the purpose of quarantine and how to implement it.●Voluntary quarantine is associated with less distress than mandatory quarantine.●Emphasize the altruistic benefit of quarantine in keeping others safe.●Facilitate acquisition of general (eg, food and housing) and medical supplies (eg, prescriptions, thermometers, and face masks).Addressing suicidality — The hardships imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including economic privation, social isolation, and reduced access to general medical and mental health care may give rise to suicidal ideation and behavior [11,12]. Suicide has been reported as an adverse effect of quarantine during previous viral epidemics [22].Individuals with moderate to severe distress, anxiety, or depression should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behavior; one can use a screening tool or simply ask. Patients with COVID-19 and patients with established psychiatric disorders should be encouraged to maintain social contact through telephone or computer, as well as face-to-face encounters that maintain physical distancing. In addition, patients should be encouraged to access treatment through telehealth or in-person.Additional risk factors for suicidality, as well as assessment and management, are discussed separately. (See ""Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"".)Schizophrenia and clozapine bloodwork — Patients receiving clozapine for schizophrenia or other serious mental illness typically require blood tests every one to four weeks to monitor absolute neutrophil counts. However, patients and clinicians need to decide whether the risks of COVID-19 outweigh the benefits of obtaining blood work. (See ""Guidelines for prescribing clozapine in schizophrenia"", section on 'Required bloodwork and coronavirus disease 2019'.)SOCIETY GUIDELINES — Select society and government-sponsored guidelines from several countries and regions around the world can be found in the following topics:General guidance from public health authorities (eg, World Health Organization or United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention): (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)More detailed guidance for specialty care, including psychiatry: (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Psychiatry'.) Resources for psychiatric patients: (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".) INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, “The Basics” and “Beyond the Basics.” The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on “patient info” and the keyword(s) of interest.) ●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")Patient education material is also available through the United States National Institute of Mental Health and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.SUMMARY●In one study from China, clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 developed moderate to severe psychiatric symptoms, including:•Anxiety – 12 percent•Depression – 15 percent•Insomnia – 8 percent•Distress – 35 percentIn addition, COVID-19 related psychiatric problems arising in clinicians may persist beyond the pandemic. (See 'Clinicians' above.)●For individuals who experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder, stepped care may be an efficacious and cost-effective approach; surveillance of mental health problems is paramount. Those with low levels of symptoms are provided with self-help materials and are eligible to speak with a mental health professional if they have additional or persistent concerns. Individuals with moderate to severe symptoms can be treated by their primary care provider or a mental health specialist. (See 'General approach' above.)●Mental health professionals working with individuals who develop psychiatric issues related to COVID-19 should address potential sources of anxiety and distress, including risk of self-exposure and infection, risk of exposing others to infection, increased and taxing workloads, moral dilemmas, and patient deaths. (See 'Addressing stressors' above.)●The adverse psychological impact of quarantine may be mitigated by taking steps such as explaining the purpose of quarantine and how to implement it, as well as emphasizing the altruistic benefit of quarantine in keeping others safe. (See 'Quarantine' above.)●The hardships imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic may give rise to suicidal ideation and behavior. Individuals with moderate to severe distress, anxiety, or depression should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients with COVID-19 and patients with established psychiatric disorders should be encouraged to maintain social contact and to access treatment through telehealth or in-person.

ID:127759,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the infection rapidly spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. The coronavirus is now designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness it causes is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to mild respiratory tract symptoms to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction. Our understanding of the spectrum of disease as well as optimal management strategies continues to evolve.This topic will address the management of patients with COVID-19 (presumed and confirmed) in the outpatient setting, including self-care advice, telehealth, outpatient clinic management, and emergency department (ED) referral. It is important to note that there are limited data informing outpatient management strategies, and the approach described here is based upon our clinical experience; clinicians should take into the account the individual patient's clinical and social circumstances as well as the available resources.General management strategies, including infection control measures, care for hospitalized patients, and specific COVID-19 complications, are discussed in detail elsewhere, as are considerations for special populations:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Psychiatric issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)GENERAL PRINCIPLESContinuum of care — When possible, we favor managing all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 within an outpatient continuum of care management program that includes:●Self-assessment tools. (See 'Patient self-assessment tools' below.)●Initial telephone triage. (See 'Initial telephone triage' below.)●Coordinated outreach and management approach based upon individual patient risk, severity of symptoms, and time course of disease. (See 'Risk stratification' below and 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below and 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)●Clinician telehealth (telephone call or video platform-based) visits (initial evaluation and follow-up visits) [1]. (See 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)●COVID-19 testing. (See 'Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing' below.)●A separate outpatient respiratory clinic or dedicated space within an ambulatory clinic appropriated for the care of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory problems. Strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by staff and other patients should be employed [2]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)In addition, the outpatient clinic should have a close, coordinated relationship with the local emergency department (ED) and function in partnership within the continuum of care program. (See 'Rationale for outpatient management and remote care' below.)●A close working relationship with local public health officials and community leaders.In such a system, patients could enter the ambulatory COVID-19 care program by contacting their primary health care provider or following discharge from the ED or an inpatient hospital stay.In addition, during the course of illness and recovery, patients would be able to transition to different sites of care for follow-up as dictated by clinical need (eg, from home self-care management, to outpatient clinic or ED evaluation, to telehealth follow-up, and back to self-care management).Rationale for outpatient management and remote care — Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients with COVID-19; in approximately 80 percent of patients, illness is mild and does not warrant medical intervention or hospitalization [3]. In addition, remote (telehealth) management is preferred for the majority of patients for the following reasons:●Remote management can prevent unnecessary in-person medical visits, including visits to urgent care facilities and EDs. It thus avoids additional, unnecessary strain on an already overburdened and overwhelmed health care system (including utilization of limited resources, especially personal protective equipment [PPE]).●In-person health care provider visits require the patient to leave their home, traveling via public, private, or emergency transport and potentially exposing others to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, upon arrival at a health care facility, patients may expose other patients and health care workers to the virus.Creating a comprehensive, coordinated outpatient care program that incorporates these components may allow more patients to receive supportive care at home and, if necessary, in the ambulatory clinic setting, further reducing ED and hospital resource utilization.Telehealth has been used for patient management during previous disease outbreaks, including SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza A H1N1 [4]. However, remote evaluation has not been studied in the setting of a global pandemic nor in caring for patients with COVID-19; thus, evidence that demonstrates improved outcomes with home management of COVID-19 is lacking.Telehealth evaluation for COVID-19 during the pandemic can be performed by telephone call, video-based telemedicine platform, or commercial video chat platform; the format chosen should be compliant with applicable patient privacy regulations [5].Flexibility in approach to care — High-quality data supporting the superiority of any single outpatient management strategy are lacking, and treatment protocols are being developed and modified as understanding of the disease evolves.Our approach is based upon our clinical experience of treating patients with COVID-19 and places additional emphasis on avoiding infection transmission, preserving limited resources (including tests and PPE), and reducing the burden on overwhelmed health care systems.The intensity (frequency and duration) of outpatient follow-up will vary according to a patient's risk for developing severe disease (table 1), will vary by institution, region, and resource availability, and will likely change with the burden of disease in a given location. As an example, some institutions have been able to establish dedicated respiratory clinics devoted to managing COVID-19 patients, with available in-person and remote management options; in many other locations, these patients are being managed by primary care clinicians, often in consultation with a team of specially trained clinicians.Additionally, institutions may need to revise protocols, even over a several-week period, in response to surges in the number of patients with suspected infection they are managing [6].INITIAL EVALUATION — Most patients who have concerns about COVID-19, even those with mild symptoms, will likely initiate contact with the health care system. For those patients, self-assessment tools, or remote (telehealth) evaluation are the preferred initial management approaches [7-9].Patient self-assessment tools — Patient education materials, including self-assessment tools, can help patients determine if medical evaluation is necessary, and proactive dissemination of these materials may increase awareness and encourage their use. Various online self-assessment tools published by medical institutions and governmental health agencies can guide patients through questions and suggest when to seek medical care; by following the guidance, many patients with mild illness may be able to recover at home on their own without needing to come in direct contact with a health care provider. Before recommending a specific assessment tool, however, clinicians should vet the options carefully, as they may exceed the abilities of patients with limited health literacy or can become quickly out-of-date based upon rapidly changing guidelines.In one study, use of a self-assessment tool embedded into the electronic health record allowed 40 percent of symptomatic patients to be appropriately triaged to self-care [9]. This study, however, was conducted in the setting of relatively low community prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and might not be representative of settings with widespread community transmission.Initial telephone triage — In addition to self-assessment tools, an initial triage call by clinic staff can often determine which patients are appropriate for self-care at home, which patients warrant a timely clinician telehealth visit (televisit), and which patients warrant an outpatient clinic visit or urgent emergency department (ED) evaluation [10]. (See 'Risk stratification' below.)Any patient with symptoms suggestive of respiratory compromise or hypoxia (eg, significant dyspnea at rest or mental confusion) should be referred for urgent in-person evaluation; the appropriate site of care depends upon the severity of symptoms and is discussed elsewhere. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing — During a pandemic, patients who live in regions with widespread community transmission and have compatible symptoms are generally managed presumptively as having COVID-19, even if they have not been tested or have an initial negative test result.Patients with COVID-19 typically first experience a viral-type illness with symptoms ranging from a mild upper respiratory tract infection (eg, pharyngitis, rhinorrhea) to a lower respiratory tract infection (eg, cough, fever), influenza-like symptoms (eg, fever, chills, headache, myalgias), or gastroenteritis (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) (table 2) [11,12]. Loss of smell and taste may also occur, with olfactory loss typically reported early in the course of illness [13]. Dyspnea, if it develops, tends to occur in most patients between four to eight days after the onset of symptoms, although it can occur after 10 days [11]. In patients with less typical symptoms such as isolated rhinorrhea or headache, the likelihood of illness due to COVID-19 should take into account the local prevalence of disease. However, during a pandemic, COVID-19 cannot be ruled out based upon clinical history. Further, even in locations with a high prevalence of COVID-19, the possibility of other etiologies of symptoms should be considered. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Initial presentation' and 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' below.)Availability of testing for SARS-CoV-2 varies widely across regions. If testing capacity and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies allow, we favor widespread use of testing, including drive-through testing, which is important for epidemiologic purposes. However, when resources are limited, SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatients with mild disease may be neither readily available nor appropriate; in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have proposed priorities for testing (table 3). Specific criteria for testing vary by location, institution, and will change over time. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'COVID-19 testing not readily available'.)In patients who are able to undergo testing, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirms COVID-19. However, given sampling variability, viral load variation, and potential false-negative results, a single negative test does not exclude infection and should not guide management [14,15]. Antibody detection has less utility for diagnosis in the acute outpatient setting and should not be used as the sole test to exclude or diagnose COVID-19. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Risk stratification — Our patient-centered continuum of care management approach is based on stratification by risk for developing severe disease and close monitoring for respiratory decompensation. Patients without severe initial symptoms, who are deemed stable enough to not require immediate in-person evaluation, are risk stratified to determine the intensity (frequency and duration) of follow-up.Assess risk for severe disease — Older age and certain chronic medical conditions have been associated with more severe illness and higher mortality with COVID-19 (table 1). We categorize patients as being high, moderate, and low risk for severe disease:●High risk•Age ≥65 years •Residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility•Immunocompromising condition•Chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma•Cardiovascular disease (including hypertension)•Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40 kg/m2)•Diabetes mellitus•Chronic kidney disease (undergoing dialysis)•Cerebrovascular disease•Chronic liver disease•Tobacco use disorder●Moderate risk•Age 20 to 64 years, without any of the specific comorbidities listed above•Age <20 years, with underlying medical conditions other than those listed above●Low risk•Age <20 years, without underlying medical conditionsThese categories are based upon CDC guidance as well as data from published cohort studies, in which older age and many of these underlying conditions were associated with severe disease and death [16-19].Additionally, in the United States, black and Hispanic patients have represented a disproportionately high percentage of hospitalizations and deaths [17,18,20]. The reasons for this finding are unclear but may be related to inequalities in the social determinants of health (eg, access to health care, economic stability, living environment, community experience, education) that predispose to disease. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)It is important to note that although patients who are ≥65 years of age or have poorly controlled chronic medical conditions have a higher risk for hospitalization and death, infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause catastrophic illness in any patient, even among moderate-risk or, less frequently, low-risk patients. In addition, although the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild disease [21,22], infants and children with underlying medical conditions warrant close monitoring; severe disease is most likely to occur in children with underlying medical conditions [23]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?'.)Assess symptom duration and severityTime course and development of dyspnea — For any patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, we establish the illness timeline: the first day symptoms began, the presence of dyspnea, and the day of dyspnea onset. While mild dyspnea is common, worsening dyspnea, particularly dyspnea at rest, and more severe chest discomfort/tightness, are concerning symptoms and suggest the development or progression of pulmonary involvement. The trajectory of dyspnea over the days following its onset is particularly important, as significant worsening and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can manifest soon after the onset of dyspnea; in studies among patients who develop ARDS, progression to ARDS occurred a median of 2.5 days after onset of dyspnea [24-28]. In patients at moderate and high risk for severe illness (table 1), outreach efforts should be focused particularly on the days following the onset of dyspnea to assess for any worsening of respiratory status.It is unclear what percentage of patients with COVID-19 develop dyspnea, as available reports are likely not representative of all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, of patients with symptomatic infection, dyspnea likely develops in only a subgroup of patients. As examples, dyspnea developed in 19 percent of approximately 1000 COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China [29]. However, in a CDC study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the United States, 43 percent of symptomatic adults and 13 percent of symptomatic children developed dyspnea [23]. Among patients who develop dyspnea, it typically begins at least several days after the onset of illness. In one study of 41 hospitalized patients in China, dyspnea developed, on average, eight days after the onset of symptoms [30]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)Dyspnea assessment — Remote assessment of dyspnea should focus on the patient's subjective symptoms, as well as an objective assessment of breathing, including deterioration in respiratory function [31]. We begin by asking if patients have developed any difficulty with their breathing, other than that associated with coughing. If yes, we ask the patient to describe the difficulty in their own words and assess the ease and comfort of their speech (eg, if they can speak comfortably in complete sentences).In addition, we ask questions that provide a more objective assessment of changes in respiratory status, including [31]:●“What activities that you could previously do without difficulty are now causing you to be out of breath?”●""Has this gotten worse over the last one, two, or three days?""●“Are you breathing harder or faster than usual when sitting still?”●“Can you no longer do your usual household activities due to shortness of breath?”●“Does walking cause you to feel dizzy?”We use this assessment to categorize dyspnea by severity:●Mild dyspnea – Dyspnea that does not interfere with daily activities (eg, mild shortness of breath with activities such as climbing one to two flights of stairs or walking briskly).●Moderate dyspnea – Dyspnea that creates limitations to activities of daily living (eg, shortness of breath that limits the ability to walk up one flight of stairs without needing to rest, or interferes with meal preparation and light housekeeping tasks).●Severe dyspnea – Dyspnea that causes shortness of breath at rest, renders the patient unable to speak in complete sentences, and interferes with basic activities such as toileting and dressing.If available, telemedicine consultation with video capability may allow an even better evaluation of respiratory status, by allowing the clinician to observe the patient's respiratory pattern, including the use of accessory muscles of respiration [7].The presence of dyspnea, along with risk factors for developing severe disease (table 1), can be used to guide clinicians in determining whether a patient requires in-person evaluation. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below.)Oxygenation assessment — If a patient with COVID-19 has access to a reliable pulse oximeter at home, and can adequately measure and report the results to the clinician, measurement of oxygen saturation can be used as an additional piece of information to assess their clinical status. Patients are advised to use their pulse oximeter on warm fingers, as readings obtained on cold digits may not be as accurate [32]. In the outpatient setting, we instruct patients to check their oximetry twice daily and inform us if the value drops below 95 percent.●For any patient with an oxygen saturation of ≤94 percent on room air, in-person evaluation is warranted. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)●For patients who have an oxygen saturation of ≥95 percent on room air, the decision on in-person evaluation depends on other clinical features such as severity of dyspnea, risk for severe disease, and assessment of overall acuity. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below.)Oximetry should only be considered within the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation; a normal oxygen saturation level cannot be used to exclude clinically significant respiratory involvement in a patient with concerning symptoms such as progressive or severe dyspnea or high overall acuity level (see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' below). In addition, although normal oximetry can be reassuring, there is no guarantee that respiratory status will not deteriorate as illness progresses.Of note, we do not consider oxygen saturation readings obtained through an application (""app"") on a mobile telephone accurate enough to depend upon for clinical use [33].As with dyspnea, the availability of telemedicine with video capability may allow the indirect assessment of hypoxia by the observation of cyanosis, if present [7].Assessment of overall acuity level — In addition to evaluation of respiratory status, we assess the patient's overall acuity level by asking questions regarding orthostasis, dizziness, falls, hypotension (if home blood pressure measurement is available), mental status change (eg, lethargy, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing), observed cyanosis, and urine output. While mild orthostasis symptoms may be addressed with instruction to increase fluids, mental status changes, falls, cyanosis, hypotension, anuria, and chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are concerning and warrant in-person evaluation. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)Assess home setting and social factors — We assess the ability of patients to monitor their symptoms and to understand the importance of seeking medical guidance should symptoms progress. Patients who lack the ability to self-monitor and self-report may need more intensive staff outreach in order to be adequately managed at home.In addition, in accordance with interim CDC guidelines on home management, we assess if the patient's residential setting is appropriate for home management and recovery [34]; patients managed at home should be capable of adhering to appropriate infection control and isolation precautions for the duration of illness and recovery (including using a separate bedroom if not living alone). Other important home resources include an available caregiver, adequate access to food, and assistance with activities of daily living if necessary. Whether the patient has any household members who are at high risk for severe disease is another consideration (table 1). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.)DETERMINE IF IN-PERSON EVALUATION WARRANTED — Based upon the above assessment, in particular the risk for developing severe disease, dyspnea and oxygenation, and overall acuity level, we determine the urgency and appropriate setting (in-person evaluation versus scheduled telehealth follow-up or self-care) for further management. For those patients who warrant in-person evaluation, we decide if outpatient clinic or emergency department (ED) evaluation is appropriate.While we use the following general criteria to determine the most appropriate clinical setting for in-person evaluation, these criteria are not fixed and will vary by institution, region, and even over time with changing resource availability.In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level — All patients with moderate or severe dyspnea, an initial oxygen saturation <95 percent on room air, or symptoms consistent with higher acuity level warrant in-person evaluation, either in the ED or in an outpatient clinic, depending upon the severity of findings.Criteria for evaluation in ED — We typically refer patients with one or more of the following features to the ED for further management:●Severe dyspnea (dyspnea at rest, and interfering with the inability to speak in complete sentences) (see 'Dyspnea assessment' above)●Oxygen saturation on room air of ≤90 percent, regardless of severity of dyspnea (see 'Oxygenation assessment' above)●Concerning alterations in mentation (eg, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing) or other signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion or hypoxia (eg, falls, hypotension, cyanosis, anuria, chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome)(see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above)Patients meeting the above criteria will typically be admitted to the hospital for inpatient evaluation and management. However, there are no fixed criteria for inpatient hospital admission with COVID-19; criteria vary by country and region. Further, in areas of high infection prevalence, the criteria may also vary with the availability of hospital resources. A lower threshold for hospitalization may be feasible in settings where the burden of disease does not exceed resource availability; in the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel suggests hospitalization for most patients with moderate to severe disease (eg, evidence of lower respiratory tract infection with or without hypoxia) [35]. As our inpatient hospital resources are outpaced by patient volume in the setting of a surge of COVID-19 cases, we have established an outpatient system to closely follow-up and monitor such patients who do not get admitted. However, this approach may not be appropriate in settings with more limited outpatient resources. (See 'Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic' below.)Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic — Patients with one of more of the following features are typically appropriate for evaluation in an outpatient clinic (ideally a dedicated respiratory/COVID-19 clinic if available), provided they do not meet any of the above criteria for evaluation in the ED:●Mild dyspnea in a patient with an oxygen saturation on room air between 91 to 94 percent (see 'Dyspnea assessment' above) ●Mild dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease (table 1) (see 'Assess risk for severe disease' above and 'Dyspnea assessment' above)●Moderate dyspnea in any patient●Symptoms concerning enough to warrant in-person evaluation (eg, mild orthostasis) but not severe enough to require ED referral (see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above)Clinic evaluation — For patients evaluated in an outpatient clinic (if feasible, a respiratory/COVID-19 clinic), we assess the patient's respiratory and circulatory status, and we evaluate for other potentially treatable causes of symptoms [11]. (See 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' below.)Based upon a careful clinical history and physical exam, including vital signs as well as measurements of oxygen saturation at rest and with ambulation, we then determine if the patient is appropriate for self-care, home management with telehealth follow-up, or transfer to the ED. The capability to manage patients in an ambulatory setting (eg, the ability to administer intravenous fluids and medications and to arrange for outpatient follow-up) will vary between institutions and by region and thus influence this decision. In addition, we also consider the patient's home setting and social factors in determining the appropriateness of continued outpatient (clinic and teleheath) management.Home oxygen therapy with oximetry for some patients — For some patients with COVID-19, stable dyspnea, and mild hypoxia, we consider providing home oxygen therapy with home oximetry monitoring if such services are available.In order to consider patients for home oxygen therapy with home oximetry for management of COVID-19, we use the following criteria:●The patient has nonsevere (mild or moderate) dyspnea, with stable, nonprogressive symptoms over several days.●Oxygen saturation is 90 to 93 percent and increases to ≥95 percent with administration of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 liters/minute; we do not titrate to a saturation above 96 percent.●The patient is likely to be adherent with therapy and recommended follow-up.Initiation of home oxygen therapy is not appropriate for patients with new onset of dyspnea and hypoxia early in the onset of illness. Severe pulmonary involvement may develop even among patients at low risk for severe disease, and the need for supplemental oxygen early in the course of illness suggests the need for hospital admission and close monitoring. In addition, in any patient with an increasing oxygen requirement at any point during the course of illness, hospitalization is often indicated.Patients sent home on oxygen therapy require close follow-up; daily clinician telehealth visits are scheduled, and patients are instructed to check oximetry three times daily. Patients receiving home oxygen should contact a clinician if:●Oxygen saturation levels are declining on the established flow rate. In such cases, remote clinician evaluation is performed to determine if in-person reevaluation is warranted. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' above.)●The oxygen saturation level drops below 90 percent, in which case ED evaluation is indicated. (See 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above.)●Worsening dyspnea develops, in which case in-person reevaluation is warranted independent of oximetry results. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' above.)Guidelines on managing critically ill patients with COVID-19 suggest initiating supplemental oxygen when the oxygenation saturation is <90 percent [36]. However, there are no data that inform outcomes using home oxygen and oximetry monitoring in outpatients with COVID-19 or that address optimal oxygen titration in such patients. Additionally, some guidelines suggest that COVID-19 patients with an oxygen saturation of ≤93 percent on room air be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management [35]. Nevertheless, our approach is based upon our clinical experience managing patients with COVID-19 in a setting where inpatient hospital resources are limited due to surging patient volume, and we have established a system to closely follow-up and monitor these patients in the outpatient setting. This approach may not be appropriate in settings with more limited outpatient resources. Ideally, home oxygen therapy and monitoring should be evaluated in the setting of a clinical trial or a rapid-cycle quality improvement project to determine if such an intervention can decrease the use of health care facilities (eg, clinic visits, hospitalizations) without negatively impacting health outcomes.In addition, health insurance coverage restrictions may limit the use of home oxygen therapy for these patients, and out-of-pocket costs may be prohibitive for some patients without health insurance.Some patients warrant transfer from clinic to ED — After initial evaluation in the outpatient clinic, some patients may require more intensive management in the ED. In particular, some patients may require ED management if they have an increased work of breathing or a history of a rapid decline in respiratory function. Additional criteria for ED evaluation are reviewed elsewhere. (See 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above.)Home management without in-person evaluation for others — The majority of patients without moderate or severe dyspnea or hypoxia can remain at home for management without in-person evaluation, if they can reliably report worsened symptoms and can self-isolate for the anticipated duration of illness.The components of home management and counseling for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are discussed elsewhere. (See 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients' below.)Whether such patients warrant telehealth follow-up depends upon their risk for severe disease and the extent of dyspnea (table 1):●Patients who are not at high risk for severe disease, and have no dyspnea are discharged to self-care at home; they do not need in-person evaluation or scheduled follow-up telehealth visits. They receive instructions to contact their clinician with any worsening symptoms.●Patients who are not at high risk for severe disease, and who have mild dyspnea, do not need in-person evaluation but are scheduled for telehealth follow-up visits.●Patients who are high risk for severe disease, and with no dyspnea, are scheduled for telehealth follow-up visits.The frequency and content of follow-up telehealth evaluation is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)Supervised residential care to facilitate isolation — Patients who would be appropriate for home care (with or without telehealth follow-up) but are unable to be adequately managed in their usual residential setting are candidates for temporary shelter in supervised residential care facilities, if available [37].In particular, patients who may be unable to adequately self-isolate (eg, patients living in multigenerational households, patients living with other high-risk individuals (table 1), patients experiencing homelessness) should be provided resources such as dedicated housing units, where available. Disruption of families should be minimized as much as possible. Every attempt should be made to avoid hospitalization simply for the purpose of facilitating self-isolation, as this option is typically not realistically available in regions with widespread disease.Unfortunately, dedicated residential care facilities for COVID-19 patients are not widely available in many countries and regions, and community-based solutions to self-isolation should be explored.OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT AND COUNSELING FOR ALL PATIENTS — When clinically appropriate, it is generally preferable to manage patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 remotely via telehealth visits. (See 'Rationale for outpatient management and remote care' above.)Interim recommendations on the outpatient management of patients with COVID-19 are provided by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, and several academic medical centers [38-41]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)Symptom management — Symptomatic treatment includes antipyretics and analgesics for myalgias and headaches and maintenance of oral fluid intake. We generally prefer acetaminophen; however, we inform patients that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use is acceptable if symptoms do not respond to acetaminophen. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Managing other potential causes of symptoms — Since symptoms of COVID-19 can overlap with those of many common conditions, it is important to consider other possible etiologies of symptoms including other respiratory infections (eg, influenza, streptococcal pharyngitis, community-acquired pneumonia [CAP]), congestive heart failure, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and even anxiety (table 2) [11].For conditions that can be treated remotely, such as possible streptococcal pharyngitis, mild asthma exacerbations, or mild exacerbations of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), we will often treat without an in-person evaluation but with scheduled daily follow-up telehealth visits. Management of specific medical conditions is discussed in the relevant UpToDate topic reviews.The prevalence of other diseases should also be considered. As an example, in regions where COVID-19 is prevalent and seasonal influenza activity remains high, patients who have symptoms consistent with both conditions should be treated empirically for influenza.We also consider the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community in our determination whether to evaluate the patient in-person; clinical judgement, however, remains the most important consideration in this decision. As an example, in regions where COVID-19 prevalence is high, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize in-person evaluations if possible; remote evaluation and management of mild dyspnea, if clinically appropriate, is preferred. (See 'Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea' below and 'Consider additional causes of worsening dyspnea' below.)Infection control — With all patients, we reinforce the importance of infection control and self-isolation and provide instructions on the anticipated duration of isolation. These are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.)Limited role for COVID-19 specific therapy — A number of therapies are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, but none have proven efficacy. Some of these, such as hydroxychloroquine, are available for other indications but remain investigational for COVID-19. Medications for COVID-19 specific therapy should not be prescribed in the ambulatory setting outside of a clinical trial [42]; data are extremely limited, and there are concerns for potential toxicity in an unmonitored setting [43].Therapies under evaluation for treatment COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Chronic medication management — In general, the patient’s usual home medication regimen is not routinely adjusted. One exception is that we advise patients who use nebulized medications to avoid their use in the presence of others and to use a metered dose inhaler preparation instead, if possible, to avoid potential aerosolization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Avoiding nebulized medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)'.)If patients already use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) device for management of obstructive sleep apnea, they may continue to use their machine; as with nebulizers, they are advised to use the device only when isolated from others.For patients taking an immunomodulating medication, we consult with the prescribing clinician about the relative risks and benefits of temporarily discontinuing it, which depend upon its indication and the severity of the underlying condition.Management of medications is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Managing chronic medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Avoiding nebulized medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Immunomodulatory agents' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis'.)Counseling on warning symptoms — We counsel all patients on the warning symptoms that should prompt reevaluation by telehealth visit and in-person, including emergency department (ED) evaluations. These include new onset of dyspnea, worsening dyspnea, dizziness, and mental status changes such as confusion. Patients are educated about the time course of symptoms and the possible development of respiratory decline that may occur, on average, one week after the onset of illness. In addition, we assess the availability of support at home, ensure that they know who to call should they need assistance, and reinforce when and how to access emergency medical services.Patients with obstructive lung disease (eg, COPD or asthma) are specifically advised to closely monitor their respiratory status, and are cautioned not to presume that any worsening shortness of breath is due to an exacerbation of their underlying lung disease.Addressing goals of care — Given the potential severity of COVID-19, all patients should have updated health care proxy and advance directive information in their electronic health record.For patients with significant underlying medical comorbidities and poor health status, COVID-19 may cause catastrophic illness including respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among such patients, those who develop life-threatening complications are likely to have a poor outcome despite the use of aggressive measures such as mechanical ventilation. For patients who are at highest risk of complications and who have the lowest likelihood of survival, the appropriateness of hospitalization and ventilator assistance should be discussed in advance of significant deterioration in clinical condition. For these patients, it may be appropriate to address home palliative care strategies in anticipation of need. Many institutions have palliative care and hospice programs to provide skilled nursing and social work support for patients and families. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Surge capacity and scarce resource allocation' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'End of life issues' and ""Advance care planning and advance directives"", section on 'COVID-19 resources'.)TELEHEALTH FOLLOW-UPFrequency of follow-up — For patients with COVID-19 determined to be appropriate for home management with telehealth follow-up, the frequency of telehealth visits is determined by their risk for severe disease (table 1), severity of respiratory symptoms, and our comfort level with their ability to self-report worsening symptoms. (See 'Home management without in-person evaluation for others' above.)●For most patients, telehealth visits are scheduled on days 4, 7, and 10 (following the onset of clinical illness).●However, for patients in whom we have the highest level of concern, we generally schedule the first follow-up telehealth visit within 24 hours. These include:•Patients aged ≥65 years who have one or more additional risk factors for severe disease (table 1)•Any patient with moderate dyspnea at the time of initial evaluation•Patients who we feel may not reliably report a deterioration in symptomsFor these patients, the frequency of subsequent telehealth visits can be reduced to every other day if the patient remains clinically stable.Repeat assessment of dyspnea and hypoxia — At each telehealth visit, we evaluate a patient's respiratory status, focusing on assessing for new or worsening dyspnea and hypoxia, as these are the most likely indications requiring in-person clinical reevaluation and potential hospitalization. In addition, we assess overall acuity level, ensuring that the patient remains clinically stable enough for remote management. (See 'Dyspnea assessment' above and 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above.)Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea — All patients who develop worsening or more severe dyspnea require further evaluation and management. We use the same criteria for determining whether a patient needs to be evaluated in-person as in our initial evaluation. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' above.)For patients who do not meet criteria for in-person evaluation, and who have potentially treatable causes of dyspnea by clinical history (eg, anxiety, mild exacerbation of congestive heart failure, mild asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations), we typically treat these conditions remotely. However, these patients are closely followed with daily telehealth visits for at least the next several days or until they are improving. The frequency and duration of subsequent follow-up is determined by their clinical course.Dyspnea severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living or cause difficulty with speaking requires an in-person evaluation. Further, new dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease should prompt an in-person evaluation (table 1). The in-person evaluation should occur in the most appropriate clinical setting, depending upon the severity of dyspnea, and may vary by health care system. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' above.)Consider additional causes of worsening dyspnea — In addition, even though some patients with worsening symptoms may be managed remotely, we perform an in-person evaluation if they have complaints suggestive of serious conditions or complications that are not amenable to telehealth management, such as severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; eg, new productive cough, pleuritic chest discomfort), asthma or COPD exacerbation (eg, cough, increasing wheezing), pulmonary embolism (eg, worsening dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis), heart failure (increasing dyspnea, edema, orthopnea) or acute pericarditis (eg, chest pain). This evaluation can take place in a respiratory (COVID-19) clinic or appropriate clinical care setting. Discussion of the evaluation and management of these conditions can be found in the relevant UpToDate topics.In particular, patients with suspected COVID-19 and dyspnea who have underlying obstructive lung disease (including COPD and asthma) present unique management challenges. For such patients, dyspnea may be simply due to an exacerbation of obstruction, and it is not possible to differentiate clinically between an isolated exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease and an exacerbation related to COVID-19. In such cases, a presumptive asthma or COPD exacerbation should be treated with a short course of oral corticosteroids and increased use of short-acting beta agonists. Patients on home oxygen at baseline should be evaluated for increased oxygen requirements. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"".)OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT FOLLOWING INPATIENT OR ED DISCHARGE — After discharge from the inpatient hospital setting or the emergency department (ED), clinician follow-up is warranted, either in outpatient clinic or via telehealth visit. At each encounter after hospital or ED discharge, we reinforce the importance of infection control and provide counseling on the warning symptoms which should prompt reevaluation. (See 'Infection control' above and 'Counseling on warning symptoms' above.)In some cases, patients are discharged home or to supervised residential care from the inpatient hospital setting on low flow oxygen therapy, with oximetry monitoring by telehealth (preferred if available) or visiting nurse. The practice of sending patients home on supplemental oxygen is widely variable, however, and if done warrants close patient monitoring. (See 'Home oxygen therapy with oximetry for some patients' above.)Patients discharged home●Most patients discharged from the inpatient setting require a follow-up clinician visit within one to two days following discharge; depending on their unique clinical and social situation, telehealth visit or in-person outpatient visit may be appropriate.●For those patients evaluated and discharged from the ED and who are felt to need follow-up care, telehealth visits may also be appropriate. The timing of such visits, however, would vary depending upon patient acuity and indication.Patients discharged to supervised residential care for recovery — As part of the continuum of care of patients with COVID-19, temporary housing in supervised residential care facilities may also be appropriate for managing patients discharged from the inpatient hospital setting, as well as those evaluated and discharged from the ED. (See 'Supervised residential care to facilitate isolation' above.)Depending upon the type of facility, the patient's medical acuity, and available resources, telehealth follow-up may be appropriate; the intensity of telehealth follow-up will vary depending upon the indication for housing (eg, solely the need for isolation versus isolation with more acute medical need).SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Our understanding of the spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as optimal management strategies continues to evolve. There are limited data informing outpatient management strategies, and the approach described here is based upon our clinical experience; clinicians should take into account the individual patient's clinical and social circumstances as well as the available resources. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. When possible, we favor a coordinated care management program that includes initial risk stratification, clinician telehealth visits (telephone call or video platform-based), a dedicated outpatient respiratory clinic, and a close relationship with a local emergency department (ED). (See 'General principles' above.)●Patients who live in regions with widespread community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have compatible symptoms are generally managed presumptively as having COVID-19, even if they have not been tested or have an initial negative test result (table 2). (See 'Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing' above.)●On initial evaluation, we assess risk factors for severe disease (table 1), dyspnea severity and duration (and oxygenation status of those with dyspnea), overall level of acuity, and the patient’s home setting to determine who warrants an in-person evaluation at an outpatient clinic or in the ED. The additional criteria we use to make this determination are not fixed and will vary by institution, region, and over time as resource availability evolves. (See 'Risk stratification' above.)We typically refer patients with one or more of the following features to the ED for further management (see 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above):•Severe dyspnea (dyspnea at rest, and interfering with the inability to speak in complete sentences)•Oxygen saturation on room air of ≤90 percent, regardless of severity of dyspnea•Concerning alterations in mentation (eg, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing) or other signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion or hypoxia (eg, falls, hypotension, cyanosis, anuria, chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome)We refer patients for evaluation in an outpatient clinic if they have one or more of the following features without any of the preceding features (see 'Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic' above):•Mild dyspnea in a patient with an oxygen saturation on room air between 91 to 94 percent•Mild dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease (table 1)•Moderate dyspnea in any patient•Symptoms concerning enough to warrant in-person evaluation (eg, mild orthostasis) but not severe enough to require ED referralOther patients can generally remain at home for management without in-person evaluation if they can reliably report worsened symptoms and can self-isolate for the anticipated duration of illness. Whether such patients warrant telehealth follow-up depends upon their risk for severe disease and the extent of dyspnea. (See 'Home management without in-person evaluation for others' above.)●When managing outpatients with COVID-19 (see 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients' above):•Symptoms of COVID-19 can overlap with those of many common conditions, so it is important to consider other possible etiologies of symptoms including other respiratory infections, congestive heart failure, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and even anxiety. For conditions that can be treated remotely, we will often treat without an in-person evaluation but with scheduled daily follow-up telehealth visits. (See 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' above.)•We reinforce the importance of infection control and self-isolation.

None of these treatments should be prescribed in the ambulatory setting outside of a clinical trial; data are extremely limited, and there are concerns for potential toxicity in an unmonitored setting.

ID:127533,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues,"INTRODUCTION — Patients infected with the virus SARS-CoV-2 and its clinical disease COVID-19 are often minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic. More severe presentations include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.In some patients, the heart may be affected, and this can occur in individuals with or without a prior cardiovascular diagnosis. Evidence of myocardial injury, as defined as an elevated troponin level, is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with putative causes including stress cardiomyopathy, hypoxic injury, ischemic injury (caused by cardiac microvascular damage or epicardial coronary artery disease), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (cytokine storm). A minority of patients with an elevated troponin level present with symptoms and signs suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiogenic shock in acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Clinical presentation' and ""Approach to diagnosis and evaluation of acute decompensated heart failure in adults"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.) Patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are at increased risk of a poor prognosis. In addition, patients with myocardial injury, irrespective of cause, have a poorer prognosis.This topic will address our approach to the diagnosis and management of patients with either an acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary artery disease (CAD) who are suspected of or who have confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our approach and recommendations only apply during the pandemic and are superseded by routine care thereafter.The potential impact of the virus on the myocardium and conduction system is discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)Other relevant topics include:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronaviruses"".)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The prevalence of CAD in particular, and cardiovascular disease in general, varies from population to population. Thus, among patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19, there is a broad range for prevalent CAD. Rates between 4.2 and 25 percent have been reported, with most series from China [1-5]. Among patients admitted to intensive care units or those who died [5], the percent is higher. Myocardial injury (increased cardiac troponin or electrocardiographic [ECG] abnormalities) was present in 7.2 percent in one study [1], while other studies have shown elevated cardiac biomarkers in as many as 20 percent [6].IMPACT ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM — It is likely that COVID-19 directly and indirectly affects the cardiovascular system and the heart in particular. Potential mechanisms of cardiovascular injury have been identified and include direct myocardial injury from hemodynamic derangement or hypoxemia, inflammatory myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, microvascular dysfunction or thrombosis due to hypercoagulability, or systemic inflammation (cytokine storm), which may also destabilize coronary artery plaques [7]. Pneumonia and influenza infections have been associated with sixfold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) [8-10]. Patients with severe COVID-19 disease, such as those with high fever or hypoxia due to lung disease, may need a significant increase in cardiac output. Type II myocardial ischemia, therefore, may result in patients with obstructive CAD. (See ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Definitions'.) The clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection will, across a population, be greater in those with prior disease and increasing age. In one study, patients with prior cardiovascular disease made up 22.7 percent of all fatal cases, and the case fatality rate was 10.5 percent [11]. ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BASELINE CVD AND COVID-19 — Aside from acute cardiac injury attributable to COVID-19 infection (see 'Impact on the cardiovascular system' above), there is substantial evidence of an association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors of hypertension and diabetes, as well as prior CAD and the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection. Although the risks associated with advanced age, history of heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, or active myocardial injury due to COVID-19 are not surprising, the available evidence suggests that even the presence of these risk factors or history of stable CAD contributes to the severity of disease and outcome [2,3,12-15]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 72,314 cases (44,672 confirmed) reported by February 11, 2020 were reviewed [16]. The crude mortality rate was 2.3 percent. For age over 80, the case fatality rate was 14.8 percent. History of coronary heart disease (CHD) was present in 4.2 percent of all cases, but in 22.7 percent of fatal cases. Case fatality rates were 10.5 percent for CHD, 7.3 percent for diabetes, and 6 percent for hypertension. Another report evaluated 1099 cases from 30 provinces within mainland China [15]. Of these, 15.7 percent were classified as severe, and 6.1 percent had a primary endpoint, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. The presence of diabetes (severe versus nonsevere disease, 16.2 versus 5.7 percent; primary endpoint versus no primary endpoint, 26.9 versus 6.1 percent), hypertension (23.7 versus 13.4 percent; 35.8 versus 13.7 percent), or CHD (5.8 versus 1.8 percent; 9 versus 2 percent) was significantly more frequent among patients with severe disease versus nonsevere disease and with a primary endpoint versus no primary endpoint. In a report of 191 patients from Wuhan province who were diagnosed before January 31, 2020, there were significant univariate associations with death outcome for diabetes (31 versus 14 percent, p = 0.005), hypertension (48 versus 23 percent, p = 0.0008), and CHD (24 versus 1 percent, p<0.0001) [3]. In a multivariable analysis, only advancing age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and D-Dimer were associated with mortality. Another study found that the presence of acute injury determined by troponin elevation was a significant factor in the association of CVD and mortality [17] (see 'Troponin' below). Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, a history of CVD (defined as CHD, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy) was present in 66 (35 percent), and troponin was elevated in 52 (28 percent). Troponin elevation was more frequent in patients with CVD (55 percent, 36 of 66). Among patients with CVD and elevated troponin, the mortality rate was 69 percent (25 of 36). The mortality rate was 7.6 percent among patients without CVD and normal troponin, 13.3 percent among those with CVD and normal troponin, 37.5 percent among those without CVD and elevated troponin, and 69.4 percent among those with CVD and elevated troponin. Furthermore, troponin elevation correlated with elevations in C-reactive protein, and higher troponin elevations predicted higher mortality. Although the number of patients included limits interpretation, there is a suggestion that patients with underlying CVD (including hypertension) are both at increased risk for acute injury and worsened survival in the setting of injury. The cause of this association and whether injury indicates increased risk for MI or myocarditis will require additional investigation. Until more data with larger numbers of patients are available, it seems reasonable to consider all patients with history of CVD, hypertension, or diabetes at higher risk. We consider this risk likely to be highest for patients with these risk factors, older age, known history of heart failure, or clinically significant valvular disease. For now, there are no specific measures based on this risk stratification, but we advise all of our patients with these risk factors to be especially cautious regarding public health measures of social distancing, including with close family members. Furthermore, given the association with more severe disease and increased risk for acute myocardial injury, we advise early clinical evaluation for any suspect symptoms.ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME PATIENTSDefinitions — The term acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is applied to patients in whom there is a suspicion or confirmation of myocardial injury. ACS patients may have either ST-elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST elevation ACS, which includes non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) or unstable angina. According to the Fourth Universal Definition of MI (see ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Definitions'), the term acute MI should be used when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia and with detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin values with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit and at least one of the following [18]:●Symptoms of myocardial ischemia.●New ischemic ECG changes. (See 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis' below.)●Development of pathological Q waves.●Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology.●Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for type 2 or 3 MI).The Fourth Universal Definition of MI includes a clinical classification according to the assumed proximate cause of the myocardial ischemia:●Type 1: MI caused by acute atherothrombotic CAD and usually precipitated by atherosclerotic plaque disruption (rupture or erosion).●Type 2: MI consequent to a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand.With COVID-19 infection, the majority of MIs are type 2 and related to the primary infection, hemodynamic, and respiratory derangement. As such, the primary disorders should be treated, and in most cases the patient can be treated conservatively with regard to coronary disease. If a type 1 infarction is thought to be the primary etiology of the MI, standard therapies can be considered. (See ""Overview of the acute management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes"" and ""Overview of the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction"".)Clinical manifestations — The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of CAD. Patients may be tachycardic (with or without palpitations) in the setting of other illness-related symptoms. In patients with COVID-19 disease, the clinical manifestations of acute CAD are likely similar to those without the virus. (See ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)Few patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have complained of chest pain on admission, but the true prevalence and characteristics of chest pain among COVID-19 patients are unknown [1,19].Physicians report that there are fewer ACS patients presenting to the hospital during the pandemic. There is concern that patients with ACS are presenting later to emergency departments or not coming at all due to fear of exposure to patients with COVID-19. These patients will suffer unnecessary morbidity and mortality without proper ACS management. Health care providers should make every effort to persuade patients with complaints suggestive of ACS to seek proper evaluation while ensuring that appropriate screening and protection are available to avoid patient and provider concern regarding nosocomial spread of the infection. If admitted, it is prudent to screen all patients for symptoms of COVID-19 (eg, fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbance) regardless of primary complaint. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)The pandemic varies in terms of intensity between regions. There are epicenters with extreme COVID-19-associated disease burden, whereas other areas continue to see more regular ACS and only rarely COVID-19 patients. Assessment of COVID-19 status — ACS patients with unknown COVID-19 status are treated as potential COVID-19 patients since aerosolization during intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the catheterization laboratory is possible. Testing for COVID-19 is recommended for NSTEMI patients who are stable prior to transfer or catheterization. ST-elevation myocardial infarction — Irrespective of COVID-19 status, urgent or emergent diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve outcomes in patients with STEMI. Patients calling the health care system with ischemic-type chest pain or anginal equivalent should be urged to present to an emergency department. (See 'Acute coronary syndrome patients' above.)Our approach to ST-elevation myocardial infarction — Our approach, which is summarized below, is generally in agreement with a provided algorithm (algorithm 1). The only way in which we differ slightly from the algorithm is that if we think STEMI with an occluded vessel is more likely than not, and that the benefit of a confirmed open artery is likely to impact overall recovery, we favor primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The following bullets summarize information contained in the next two sections. (See 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis' below and 'Management' below.)For COVID-19 patients or those under investigation [20]:●If the patient is not critically ill, we perform primary PCI (with masking of the patient) in most cases. We consider fibrinolytic therapy in lower-risk patients (eg, nonanterior MI, hemodynamic stability, not at high bleeding risk), particularly if there are personal protective equipment (PPE) limitations or a crisis surge in patients. (See ""Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: The use of fibrinolytic therapy"".)●In patients who are critically ill due to COVID-19 infection (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome multiorgan failure), the decision to reperfuse or not should be managed on a case-by-case basis. ●We perform primary PCI when the benefits appear more likely than not to have a positive impact on overall outcome. This requires weighing several factors on a case-by-case basis such as size of myocardial territory at risk, hemodynamic consequences of ongoing ischemia, and severity of nonischemic complications related to infection. Available local resources and the ability to protect the staff from infection also need to be taken into account.Diagnosis and differential diagnosis — The diagnosis of STEMI is normally not difficult. However, during the pandemic, alternative causes of myocardial injury (such as stress [takotsubo] cardiomyopathy or myocarditis) are important to consider (table 1). STEMI usually requires that the patient have chest pain or anginal equivalent symptomatology and ECG characteristics that include ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads (see ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"", section on 'ST-elevation'):●New ST-segment elevation at the J-point in two contiguous leads with the cut-points: ≥0.1 mV in all leads other than leads V2 to V3. ●For leads V2 to V3: ≥2 mm in men ≥40 years of age, ≥2.5 mm in men <40 years of age, or ≥1.5 mm in women regardless of age.●In the absence of ST elevation on ECG, new left bundle branch block with anginal symptoms is considered to be a STEMI equivalent.However, ECG criteria are not specific for coronary artery thrombosis, particularly in COVID-19 patients in whom ST elevation may occur with stress cardiomyopathy or possibly myocarditis. Thus noncoronary artery COVID-19-associated myocardial injury needs to be carefully considered as a diagnostic possibility before reperfusion therapy is considered. In most patients with ST elevation, the diagnosis will be thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".) For patients with an elevated troponin and suspected STEMI, echocardiography is not generally used to identify which patients need emergent angiography since we believe the vast majority of patients require angiography regardless of echocardiographic findings. (See 'Echocardiography' below.)Management — For STEMI patients who are known to not be infected with the virus, we manage them with usual approach of primary PCI except that we mask all patients. If myocarditis seems more likely than STEMI (see 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis' above), we suggest a conservative approach with aspirin and heparin administration until the diagnosis becomes clearer. For confirmed cases or COVID-19 status under investigation in patients with STEMI, there are two important early management questions: ●Does the patient have a life-threatening (critical) illness, such as respiratory failure from COVID-19, that makes them a less-than-ideal candidate for reperfusion? Practitioners typically asked this question before revascularization in all patients prior to the pandemic. During the pandemic, it is an essential question.●During the pandemic, should fibrinolytic therapy be used more liberally as the choice for early reperfusion? With regard to the first issue, the harm associated with pursuing reperfusion therapy may exceed the anticipated gain in some COVID-19 patients, particularly if the primary competing illness portends a poor outcome. As is true for all patients with STEMI, comorbidities, size of infarction, delay to presentation, and hemodynamic status must be considered when determining if reperfusion therapy will be employed.Regarding the second issue, and with the understanding that PCI is generally preferred to fibrinolytic therapy, some experts have raised the possibility that a more liberal use of fibrinolytic therapy (than what is normally recommended) may be necessary in some settings due to resource utilization and risk of viral exposure for health care providers (see ""Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Selecting a reperfusion strategy"", section on 'Summary and recommendations'). The argument, in part, is that there will be less viral exposure to the catheterization laboratory staff. It should be recognized, however, that fibrinolysis may not reduce resource utilization during the pandemic since the majority of patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy will still require coronary angiography at some point during hospitalization, usually within 3 to 24 hours as part of a pharmacoinvasive or rescue strategy for fibrinolysis failure. These patients will require monitoring in an ICU, thereby utilizing a scarce resource and prolonging length of stay. Furthermore, there are some patients who may be exposed to the risk of bleeding from fibrinolysis, specifically intracranial hemorrhage, in the setting of myocarditis, and some may not realize the benefit of myocardial salvage in the context of a competing life-threatening illness or small territory at risk. As such, we continue to prefer PCI as the reperfusion strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the decision must be considered in the larger context of the availability of resources within the system, as well as important patient factors including age, infarct location, and duration of symptoms that influence fibrinolysis efficacy, bleeding risk, and the chances of substantial myocardial salvage.When deciding between primary PCI and fibrinolytic therapy, factors such as significant associated comorbidities and hospital resource limitations should be taken into account. For example, a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory failure may not be an optimal candidate to reap the benefit of myocardial reperfusion, while a patient with suspected COVID-19 and mild or moderate infection is likely to benefit from myocardial salvage, and if the resources are available, then reperfusion should be performed despite the risk to providers and the resources required.Irrespective of the initial reperfusion strategy, we treat all STEMI patients with early aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, and anticoagulation. High-dose statin is started as soon as possible after the diagnosis.Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction — NSTEMI patients require urgent management but generally do not require a catheterization laboratory emergently (see ""Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes: Revascularization"", section on 'Timing'). In the face of resource limitation during the COVID-19 pandemic, any decision to proceed with an invasive strategy should take into account current health care resources. In some geographies, cardiac catheterization laboratories have been converted to ICUs.For patients in whom medical therapy is likely to lead to a worse outcome (ie, higher-risk patients) (see ""Risk stratification after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome"", section on 'Very high-risk patients' and ""Risk stratification after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome"", section on 'Early risk stratification tools'), we attempt to utilize the catheterization laboratory. We perform urgent catheterization on NSTEMI patients for reasons such as ongoing evidence of myocardial ischemia (eg, repetitive episodes of angina or dynamic ECG changes, ventricular arrhythmias, or heart failure). Other complications have included arrhythmias and shock. In one study, these were reported in 17, 7, and 9 percent of patients, respectively [1]. In a series of 21 severely ill patients admitted to the ICU in the United States, one-third developed cardiomyopathy [21]. Diagnosis uncertain — Where there is uncertainty as to whether the individual has an ACS due to plaque rupture, combined use of clinical evaluation and ECG are usually sufficient to make a decision. (See ""Evaluation of emergency department patients with chest pain at low or intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome"" and ""Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department"".) Consultation with a cardiologist is suggested for cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain.Echocardiography — Among patients with COVID-19 with suspected ACS, the role of echocardiography in altering the pretest probability of CAD is limited to low- or intermediate-risk patients. In patients with COVID-19, an echocardiogram may be performed if requested by a consulting cardiologist and is expected to have a significant impact on management or is likely to change the patient's prognosis. (See ""Noninvasive testing and imaging for diagnosis in patients at low to intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome"" and ""Evaluation of emergency department patients with chest pain at low or intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome"".)Findings on an echocardiogram that favor a condition other than ACS (eg, stress cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, pericarditis, or noncardiac cause of chest pain) include:●No wall motion abnormalities during chest pain.●Wall motion abnormalities not supportive of regional injury suggested by the ECG.●Wall motion abnormalities in a noncoronary distribution.●Less specific findings, such as small pericardial effusion.It is recognized that focal wall motion abnormalities may be present in patients with noncoronary myocardial injury and conversely that global dysfunction may accompany ACS, and so the echocardiography cannot be the sole determinant of whether reperfusion therapy is pursued. The role of echocardiography in patients with COVID-19 without suspected ACS is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)Cardiogenic shock — The primary disorder in the majority of patients with severe COVID-19 infection is hypoxia-related respiratory failure. A proportion develop systemic hyperinflammatory response and vasodilatory shock as the viremia clears. This phase of illness may be accompanied by concomitant myocardial suppression and cardiogenic shock. This mixed etiology of shock can be difficult to manage, particularly if the patient has preexisting cardiovascular dysfunction. It has been observed infrequently that more severe cardiovascular dysfunction occurs with mild respiratory compromise and inflammation. It is possible that these patients are suffering from myocardial injury as a manifestation of or response to the infection [22]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults"", section on 'Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)'.)There are anecdotal reports of patients recovering from the respiratory illness with subsequent abrupt cardiovascular collapse. Whether this is related to an inflammatory or some other process remains uncertain. It remains to be described whether an unchecked inflammatory response results in this late hemodynamic sequelae. Other issuesIssues facing catheterization laboratory personnel — We generally agree with approaches outlined in a report from the American College of Cardiology's Interventional Council and the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention [23]. Similar protocols have been created, including one from the Interventional Cardiology Association and Heart Rhythm Association of the Spanish Society of Cardiology [24]. Efforts should be made to avoid the patient remaining in waiting areas and halls, particularly in which staff will be directly interacting with the patient. Equipment for PCI (eg, sheath, guiding catheter, and possibly a workhorse wire and balloon) should be placed in the room prior to patient arrival to avoid repeated entry and exit of the staff.We encourage training and simulation in donning and doffing PPE, observing to monitor adherence to best practices, and reading the proper sequences (figure 1 and figure 2) [25] (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Precautions' and 'Donning and doffing personal protective equipment' below). We recommend daily checks to ensure adequate PPE is available and standard checks of the ""code"" or ""crash"" cart. There is no consensus as to whether positive-pressure catheterization rooms should be converted to no-pressure or negative-pressure rooms. If resources allow, it appears prudent to designate one room for suspected/confirmed COVID-19-positive patients, recognizing this may not be possible in some situations. Equipment in closed cabinets is not thought to require disinfectant after a procedure that involves a patient with established or suspected COVID-19, but only a minimal amount of supplies and equipment should be kept in this room. Unused equipment that is not covered, especially if the procedure involved aerosolization (eg, intubation, transesophageal echocardiography, cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]), should be discarded or the packaging should be disinfected before additional use. The minimal number of personnel should enter the room, with at least the operator or a nurse in the room and a technologist in the control booth. Donning and doffing personal protective equipment — A reasonable sequence for donning and doffing PPE is as follows (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings""):●Remove any personal items.●Put on the lead apron.●Put on a disposable gown.●Gather the necessary PPE and check for their integrity.●Perform hand hygiene with alcohol hand gel/rub.●Put on the proper disposable respirator (N95 or FFP2 standard; FFP3 is available for anesthesiologists and nurses helping with airways maneuvers).●Put on hair cover.●Put on shoe covers.●Put on goggles and/or face shield, avoiding any interference with the respirator.●Perform hand hygiene. ●Put on the first pair of gloves.●Put on a second gown (sterile or not, according to your role in catheterization laboratory) not using the inside tie. ●Put on a second pair of gloves (over cuff), sterile if needed.A safe doffing area should be identified in each catheterization laboratory, in particular if no anteroom or exists. If no anteroom is available, doffing of PPE could be done inside the laboratory, at the end of procedure, and when the patient has been transferred away. Only the facial respirator must be removed outside the contaminated area. The following are sequential steps:●Avoid any contact with your face, hair, and eyes before completing the entire doffing process.●Place any disposable PPE in the clinical waste bin.●Do not fill the clinical waste bin more than three-fourths full in order to be able to close it safely without squeezing contaminated materials to avoid aerosolization.●Reprocess the non-disposable PPE.Inside the catheterization laboratory:●Wait until the patient is out of the room; close the door.●Perform hand hygiene over the gloves.●Peel off gown and gloves together and roll inside, slowly and carefully, avoiding aerosolization.●If gloves are removed separately, touch only the external part (use glove-in-glove or beak technique).●Perform hand hygiene (over the internal gloves).●Remove face shield and/or goggles, avoiding contact with face and eyes, and dispose them safely or put into a separate container for reprocessing.●Perform hand hygiene (over the internal gloves).●Remove hair cover and dispone it safely.●Remove shoe covers and dispone them safely.●Perform hand hygiene (over the internal gloves).●Remove internal gloves and dispose them safely.●Perform hand hygiene.●Step out of the catheterization laboratory and immediately close the door.Outside the operating room:●Put on another pair of gloves●Remove facial respirator without touching the front side of the respirator●Remove the gloves●Remove lead apron●Perform hand hygiene with soap, water, and alcohol gel/rubNo guidelines have been issued that address whether health care workers exposed to blood of COVID-19 patients should be managed any differently than usual. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation — A discussion of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in COVID-19 patients is presented separately. (See ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"", section on 'Resuscitation of patients with COVID-19'.) Prognosis — Prognosis for patients with COVID-19 is worse with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. In an early report from China, mortality was 10.5 percent in patients with cardiovascular disease [26].Mortality rates appear to increase significantly with increasing age; case fatality rates <1 percent have been reported for those under 50 years of age, with rates approaching 15 percent for patients 80 years of age or older [12]. Similarly, mortality increases with disease severity, as there were no deaths reported among the mild or severe cases in the Chinese cohort, but mortality approached 50 percent among critically-ill patients [12]. Underlying medical comorbidities appear to significantly impact COVID-19 severity and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and hypertension have been reported to have significantly high-case fatality rates compared with patients without these underlying comorbidities (10.5 and 6 percent mortality, respectively, compared with 0.9 percent mortality without underlying comorbidities) [12,27].In addition, reports have found that the higher the troponin level, the worse the prognosis. This has been generally found in other situations. (See ""Troponin testing: Clinical use"", section on 'Prognosis' and ""Troponin testing: Clinical use"", section on 'General population'.)STABLE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS — We do not change our usual management of CAD in patients with COVID-19 infection, with one exception: We attempt to delay elective revascularization procedures in patients for whom the indication is relief of symptoms. Such an approach protects the patient and health care workers from potential viral exposure. For patients who must have revascularization for reasons such as extremely poor quality of life or prolongation of life, as with significant left main CAD, we test the patient for COVID-19 infection.Decisions regarding the type of revascularization (eg, coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) in these patients may be altered during the pandemic, favoring PCI as a method to shorten the duration of exposure of the patient to the hospital environment. We encourage heart team discussion with inclusion of the patient regarding these issues. We do not routinely test the patient for COVID-19 infection in this setting. None of the usual medications for the management of CAD, such as aspirin, beta blockers, statins, and nitrates, have been associated with worse outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 infection. We continue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'ACE inhibitors/ARBs'.)Patients admitted for management of COVID-19 — Many patients admitted for management of COVID-19 will have stable CAD (see 'Epidemiology' above). Electrocardiogram — All patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected should have a baseline ECG performed at the time of entry into the hospital. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single-lead or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient. This will allow for documenting baseline QRS-T morphology should the patient develop signs/symptoms suggestive of myocarditis or an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the baseline ECG allows for documentation of the QT (and corrected QTc) interval. Importantly, QTc will need to be monitored if QT-prolonging therapies are initiated (eg, azithromycin, chloroquine, etc) to reduce the risk of acquired long QT syndrome. (See ""Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)'.)Troponin — Cardiac troponin elevation is seen in about 20 to 30 percent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is associated with a higher mortality [3,17,27]. Most patients with troponin elevation and COVID-19 do not have a clinical presentation suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). (See 'Association between baseline CVD and COVID-19' above.)The optimal use of troponin testing in hospitalized COVID-19 patients without suspected ACS is not known. Many centers obtain a troponin soon after admission in all patients, as it may have prognostic value and may serve as a useful baseline for comparison in patients who subsequently develop manifestations of possible myocardial injury (such as heart failure or arrhythmia) [28]. Other centers limit troponin testing in this setting to patients with a specific indication (such as suspected ACS based on clinical presentation or new onset heart failure), as the clinical value of troponin levels has not been established, and results may lead to unnecessary use of medical resources (eg, serial troponins, ECGs, and cardiology consultations for elevated troponin) [29]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●A relatively high percent of patients admitted with COVID-19 will have underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). For most, symptoms of CAD will not be present on admission. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●It is likely that COVID-19 directly and indirectly affects the cardiovascular system, causing or contributing to acute coronary syndromes (ACS), myocarditis, and electrical heart disease. (See 'Impact on the cardiovascular system' above.)●Health care providers should make every effort to persuade patients to seek proper evaluation if the diagnosis of ACS is considered. (See 'Acute coronary syndrome patients' above.)●In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, we approach the diagnosis and management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) similar to those without. On occasion, it is reasonable to liberalize the use of fibrinolytic therapy relative to primary percutaneous coronary intervention. (See 'ST-elevation myocardial infarction' above.)●In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, we approach the diagnosis and management of non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) similar to those without. (See 'Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction' above.)●We do not change our usual management of CAD in patients with COVID-19 infection with one exception: We attempt to delay elective revascularization procedures in patients for whom the indication is relief of symptoms. (See 'Stable coronary artery disease patients' above.)●For hospitalized COVID-19 patients with stable CAD, some centers routinely obtain a baseline cardiac troponin while others do not.

ID:127537,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury,"INTRODUCTION — The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously referred to as 2019-nCoV). Patients with COVID-19 commonly present with signs of myocardial injury. This topic will discuss evaluation and management of these patients.Other cardiac issues in patients with COVID-19 are discussed separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)Other clinical aspects of COVID-19 are discussed separately: ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".) ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)DEFINITION AND ETIOLOGY — The term ""myocardial injury"" encompasses all conditions causing cardiomyocyte death. Myocardial injury is commonly clinically identified by the presence of at least one cardiac troponin value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), in accordance with the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction [1]. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels are sensitive markers of myocardial injury; however, some patients with disease processes causing cardiomyocyte death may have troponin levels below the 99th percentile URL. Cardiac troponin elevation does not distinguish among the causes of myocardial injury. Putative causes of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 include myocarditis (which may have a pseudo-infarct presentation with normal coronary arteries) [2,3], hypoxic injury, stress cardiomyopathy, ischemic injury caused by cardiac microvascular damage or epicardial coronary artery disease (with plaque rupture or demand ischemia), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (cytokine storm) [4,5]. However, the contribution of each of these putative causes to myocardial injury in this setting has not been determined. It is also unknown whether angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2-related signaling pathways have a role in COVID-19-related cardiac injury. (See ""Troponin testing: Clinical use"" and ""Elevated cardiac troponin concentration in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome"" and ""Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"".)Although some COVID-19 case reports have described findings consistent with a diagnosis of ""clinically suspected myocarditis"" [3] or possible stress cardiomyopathy [6-11], no case of biopsy- or autopsy-proven viral myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been reported thus far. A case report described a patient with COVID-19 with regional wall motion abnormalities and endomyocardial biopsy findings consistent with lymphocytic myocarditis, but molecular analysis showed absence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the myocardium [12]. A separate case report described a patient with COVID-19 who developed cardiogenic shock; light and electron microscopy of endomyocardial biopsy specimens revealed low-grade interstitial and endocardial inflammation, with viral particles identified in cytopathic macrophages but not in cardiomyocytes, which showed nonspecific features (eg, focal myofibrillar lysis and lipid droplets) [10]. These cases illustrate that identification of SARS-CoV-2 in specimens from the upper or lower respiratory tract is not sufficient to prove that myocardial injury was caused by SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis [6-8]. SARS-CoV-2 is not a known cardiotropic virus, and cardiotropic viruses that are known to be associated with myocarditis (eg, enterovirus, which is associated with diarrhea and parvovirus B19, which is associated with a pseudoinfarct presentation) were not searched for in most of the reported cases and might be involved. Proof that COVID-19 may be a new cause of viral myocarditis requires the presence of histological findings of active myocarditis (ie, inflammatory lymphomonocytic infiltrates plus myocyte necrosis not typical of ischemic injury) plus the identification of the COVID-19 genome in heart tissue and/or identification of viral particles in cardiomyocytes in the absence of known cardiotropic viruses [3]. Limited data are available on autopsy findings in patients dying from COVID-19. In case reports describing autopsy results for six patients who died from COVID-19 (one patient in Beijing [13], two in Oklahoma [14], three in New Orleans [15]), histologic examination of cardiac tissue did not show myocarditic changes. Troponin levels were not reported for three of these patients; two of the three New Orleans cases had elevated antemortem troponin levels (up to twice the upper reference limit), and one case had troponin levels within the reference range. In the New Orleans case series, all of the patients had cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, obesity, and gross examination revealed cardiomegaly and right ventricular dilation with no significant coronary artery stenosis or acute thrombus [15]. Histologic examination revealed scattered individual cardiomyocyte cell necrosis with no confluent areas of myocyte necrosis and rare areas with lymphocytes adjacent to but not surrounding degenerating myocytes. No viral cytopathic effect was identified by light microscopy, but studies for viral genome were not performed in this case series. Further investigation, including histologic examination of cardiac tissue in COVID-19 patients, is required to characterize the relationship between COVID-19 and myocardial injury. Since biopsy-proven myocarditis may occur in the absence of troponin release, autopsy studies of COVID-19 victims, regardless of troponin levels, would be helpful in clarifying whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is a new cause of viral myocarditis. PREVALENCE — Evidence of myocardial injury is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but the causes of myocardial injury have not been elucidated, and its contribution to incident heart failure has not been well characterized. Myocardial injury — The frequency of myocardial injury (as reflected by elevation in cardiac troponin levels) is variable among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with reported frequencies of 7 to 28 percent [2,16-18]. Some studies have identified greater frequency and magnitude of troponin elevations in hospitalized patients with more severe disease and worse outcomes [2,16,19-21]. Data are lacking on the frequency of troponin elevations in asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.In a series of 416 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, 19.7 percent had high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit on admission [2]. Patients with this marker of myocardial injury were older and had more comorbidities (including chronic heart failure in 14.6 versus 1.5 percent), greater laboratory abnormalities (including higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and aspartate aminotransferase), more lung radiographic abnormalities, and more complications compared with those without myocardial injury. The mortality rate was also higher in those with myocardial injury (51.2 versus 4.5 percent). The risk of death starting from the time of symptom onset was more than four times higher in patients with evidence of myocardial injury on admission (hazard ratio 4.26; 95% CI 1.92-9.49). In another study from Wuhan, elevation in hs-TnI above the 99th percentile upper reference limit was identified on admission in 46 percent of nonsurvivors versus 1 percent of survivors [20]. In contrast, a study of 24 critically ill COVID-19 patients in Seattle, with a 50 percent mortality rate, found elevated troponin levels early after intensive care unit admission in only 2 of 13 (15 percent) tested patients [18]. Some of the differences in frequency of troponin elevation may be due to use of differing troponin assays and differences in patient populations. Of note, only one study assessed and found considerably greater prevalence of preexisting cardiovascular disease and cardiac risk factors in patients with evidence of myocardial injury compared with those without elevated biomarkers [2]. Thus, it is not yet possible to determine whether myocardial injury is an independent risk marker in COVID-19 or if the risk associated with it is related to the burden of preexisting cardiovascular disease. Heart failure — Limited data are available on the incidence of heart failure in patients with COVID-19. In a retrospective study of 799 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, heart failure was identified as a complication in 49 percent of patients who died and in 3 percent of patients who recovered, despite a less than one percent baseline prevalence of chronic heart failure in the combined groups [22]. In a study of 191 patients hospitalized in two other medical centers in Wuhan, heart failure was identified in 52 percent of patients who died and in 12 percent of patients who recovered [20].Although the acute heart failure incidence was not documented in some series of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, elevated natriuretic peptides (such as brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] and N-terminal proBNP [NT-proBNP]) have been identified, particularly in patients with evidence of cardiac injury. In the above described series of 416 hospitalized patients, NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in patients with elevated troponin levels than in patients without troponin elevation (1689 versus 139 pg/mL) [2]. (See 'Myocardial injury' above.)Heart failure in patients with COVID-19 may be precipitated by acute illness in patients with pre-existing known or undiagnosed heart disease (eg, coronary artery disease or hypertensive heart disease) or incident acute myocardial injury (eg, acute myocardial infarction, stress cardiomyopathy, cytokine storm, and other possible etiologies described above). Cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For example, in a report of 191 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, comorbidities included hypertension in 30 percent, diabetes mellitus in 19 percent, and coronary heart disease in 8 percent [20]. Patients with a known history of heart failure may suffer an acute decompensation due to the development of COVID-19 disease [9].CLINICAL FEATURESClinical presentation — Most patients with COVID-19 with evidence of myocardial injury present with the typical symptoms and signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, as described separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)A minority of patients with COVID-19 with evidence of myocardial injury present with cardiac symptoms (such as chest pain or palpitations [23]) or more nonspecific symptoms (fatigue); these symptoms may or may not be accompanied by prior or concurrent symptoms of respiratory infection [4,24]. Initial testsLaboratory tests — Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count with differential, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and blood glucose. (See ""Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure"", section on 'Initial panels'.)ECG — A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is generally performed in patients presenting for acute care with suspected symptomatic COVID-19. This enables documentation of baseline QRS-T morphology should the patient develop symptoms or signs of a type of myocardial injury such as an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the baseline ECG allows for documentation of the QT (and corrected QTc) interval. Importantly, QTc will need to be monitored if QT-prolonging therapies are initiated (eg, azithromycin, chloroquine) to reduce the risk of acquired long QT syndrome. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'ECG' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' and ""Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"".)ECG abnormalities that have been reported in patients with COVID-19 and troponin elevation include T-wave depression and inversion, ST-segment depression, and Q waves [2]. ST-segment elevation has been reported in patients with findings consistent with clinically suspected myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy [6,8]. The most common arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 is sinus tachycardia but atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ventricular tachycardia may occur. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)Troponin — Troponin testing is commonly performed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as it may have prognostic value and may serve as a useful baseline for comparison in patients who develop manifestations of possible myocardial injury (such as heart failure or arrhythmia). Some experts also perform troponin testing in selected outpatients with uncertain level of risk. As mentioned above, among patients with COVID-19, troponin levels are most prevalent and most elevated with more severe disease [17,25]. An elevated troponin is likely not indicative of an acute coronary syndrome in the absence of suggestive symptoms, signs, or ECG findings.In patients with COVID-19, troponin elevation may be initially detected prior to, at the time of, or following hospital admission [6-9,17,20,21,26]. A variety of time courses for troponin elevation have been observed:●Mild – Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 commonly have mild troponin elevation (typically <99th percentile upper reference limit), with modest rise or fall on subsequent days, typically remaining well below the 99th percentile upper reference limit [17]. This appears to be the most common pattern of troponin elevation in patients with COVID-19 and is often associated with no cardiac symptoms. This pattern has been described in patients with COVID-19 who survived after hospitalization [20]. ●Moderate time-limited – Early moderate troponin elevation (which may approach or exceed the 99th percentile upper reference limit), which may fall on subsequent days. This pattern was seen in anecdotal reports of patients with clinically suspected myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy [6-9].●Progressive – Some patients with moderate troponin elevation at hospital admission suffer clinical deterioration with respiratory failure accompanied by progressive troponin elevation, along with elevations in other biomarkers (eg, D-dimer, interleukin-6, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase) with accelerated rise after the second week of hospitalization [20,21]. This progression to cytokine storm has been described in nonsurvivors, with death occurring at a median of 18.5 days after symptom onset [20]. Natriuretic peptide — A natriuretic peptide level (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal proBNP) is obtained in patients with suspected heart failure if the diagnosis of heart failure is uncertain. (See ""Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure"", section on 'BNP and NT-proBNP'.)As described above, natriuretic peptide levels are commonly elevated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in patients with elevated cardiac troponin levels. (See 'Heart failure' above.)DIAGNOSISWhen to suspect myocardial injury and key considerations — Myocardial injury should be suspected in patients with COVID-19 with one or more of the following new findings: troponin elevation, global or regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, unexplained cardiac arrhythmias, or ECG changes (particularly diffuse ST elevation).Diagnostic evaluationKey considerations — The approach to evaluation of myocardial injury in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 may differ from the standard approach to evaluation of myocarditis, as it is based upon weighing the following considerations [25]: ●The likelihood that evaluation will change management. Thus, it is important to identify a treatable cause of myocardial injury that requires timely intervention, such as acute myocardial infarction. ●Considerations of nosocomial infection control to limit the spread of disease.●Optimal management of limited available medical staff and resources to provide for the health care needs of the community.Diagnostic approach — The diagnostic evaluation includes the following components (see ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Approach to diagnosis of myocarditis'):●Clinical evaluation includes history, physical examination, ECG, serum cardiac troponin levels, and initial laboratory tests to assess for symptoms and signs of heart failure and possible causes (including conditions unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection). Natriuretic peptide (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal proBNP) measurement is indicated if the diagnosis of heart failure is uncertain. (See 'Initial tests' above.)●Decisions regarding the need for further evaluation are based upon whether test results will alter clinical management. •If the clinical presentation is suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), timely evaluation is required to determine if urgent intervention is indicated. There is an elevated risk of ACS among patients with COVID-19 given the high prevalence of comorbidities in this patient population. Evaluation of coronary disease in patients with COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"".)•For patients with COVID-19 without suspected ACS: -Most patients with mild troponin elevation without symptoms and signs of acute heart failure can be clinically monitored without cardiac imaging.-For patients who develop new onset heart failure, echocardiogram may be performed to evaluate regional and global ventricular and valvular function if this is requested by a consulting cardiologist and is expected to have a significant impact on management or is likely to change the patient's prognosis. Echocardiography findings that have been described in case reports of patients with COVID-19 include focal and global left ventricular wall motion abnormalities and pericardial effusion. ●For patients with a ventricular motion abnormality, elevated troponin, and no ACS, possible diagnoses include stress cardiomyopathy and clinically suspected myocarditis (along with other causes of myocardial injury described above). (See 'Myocardial injury' above.)•A diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy is based on identification of the following four features: transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction (typically not in a single coronary distribution; patterns include apical, mid-ventricular, and basal), absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary disease or acute plaque rupture; presence of new ECG abnormalities (either ST-segment elevation and/or T-wave inversion); or modest elevation in cardiac troponin and absence of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis. The diagnostic evaluation of stress cardiomyopathy is discussed separately. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy"".)•In patients with COVID-19 with suspected myocarditis, the decision on whether to proceed with further evaluation for myocarditis (with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [CMR] and possible endomyocardial biopsy) is based on the likelihood of a diagnosis that would alter therapy. Care must be taken to balance the risk of potential nosocomial spread of the disease and benefit of this additional information to modifying treatment. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)-Since there is no established therapy for clinically suspected myocarditis, we do not recommend routine evaluation for myocarditis in patients with COVID-19. Although case reports have described empiric immunotherapy in a few patients with COVID-19 with clinically suspected myocarditis (with or without CMR confirmation), the safety and efficacy of such therapy are uncertain. -Evaluation for myocarditis by endomyocardial biopsy (with or without prior CMR, depending on the patient's condition and available resources) may be appropriate in selected cases when a treatable type of myocarditis is suspected (eg, giant cell myocarditis), or in the presence of severe unexplained biventricular dysfunction, unexplained cardiogenic shock, or unexplained life-threatening arrhythmia with normal coronary arteries (with or without troponin increase) to confirm a definitive diagnosis of myocarditis and identify its cause to enable possible etiology-directed therapy [3]. Since biopsy-proven myocarditis is highly prevalent in young patients and very rare in the elderly, the clinical suspicion of myocarditis should be higher, and the threshold to perform an endomyocardial biopsy should be lower in young patients without cardiovascular comorbidities. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Approach to diagnosis of myocarditis' and ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Management of specific disorders'.)MANAGEMENTGeneral approachSupportive cardiac care — The optimal management for myocardial injury associated with COVID-19 has not been determined. Thus, the management of patients with myocardial injury, including clinically suspected myocarditis, involves supportive care (including management of heart failure, therapy for arrhythmias, and avoidance of cardiotoxins), as discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Management' and ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'General management' and ""Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"" and ""Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy"" and ""Overview of the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adults"" and ""Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"" and ""Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction"".)Patients with COVID-19 and heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction should receive standard therapy for these conditions including pharmacologic therapy, careful management of fluid balance, and advanced therapies as needed. (See ""Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"" and ""Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy"" and ""Overview of the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adults"" and ""Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"" and ""Management of refractory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction"" and ""Management and prognosis of asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction"".) General management including thromboprophylaxis — General management of COVID-19 and critical care issues are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)Hypercoagulability and the role of thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)Investigational — While laboratory evidence of a marked inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome, is associated with critical and fatal illness in patients with COVID-19, no treatment has been identified for this syndrome. Investigational protocols using the interleukin-6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab are ongoing. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in adults"", section on 'Management of specific disorders' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)ACE inhibitors and ARBs — Of note, standard indications for an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (and for the latter two drugs in treatment of hypertension) apply to patients with COVID-19. Although there has been speculation that elevated ACE2 levels caused by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors might impact susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 because ACE2 is a receptor for this virus, there is no evidence that treatment with these drugs worsens the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)Issues for ventricular assist devices and cardiac transplantation — Patients supported by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) may present with low-flow alarms due to the vasodilation coupled with diarrhea and dehydration, which can occur with COVID-19 infection. However, vigorous fluid resuscitation can result in right heart failure in these LVAD patients. (See ""Practical management of long-term mechanical circulatory support devices"", section on 'Right heart failure' and ""Right heart failure: Causes and management"".)Whether maintenance immunosuppression for cardiac transplant recipients should be altered and whether these patients have more or less severe COVID-19 is unknown. There has been some suggestion that the late stage of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome may be alleviated by the presence of immunosuppression, as it may reduce the cytokine response. Many heart transplant centers have reduced antiproliferative agents (eg, mycophenolate mofetil) in patients with COVID-19 infection [9,17]; generally, calcineurin inhibitors and prednisone doses have been maintained in this setting. (See ""Heart transplantation in adults: Induction and maintenance of immunosuppressive therapy"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●The term ""myocardial injury"" encompasses all conditions causing cardiomyocyte death. Myocardial injury is commonly clinically identified by the presence of at least one cardiac troponin value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL). High-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels are sensitive markers of myocardial injury; however, some patients with disease processes causing cardiomyocyte death may have troponin levels below the 99th percentile URL. (See 'Definition and etiology' above.)●Putative causes of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 include myocarditis, hypoxic injury, stress cardiomyopathy, ischemic injury caused by cardiac microvascular damage or epicardial coronary artery disease (with plaque rupture or demand ischemia), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (cytokine storm). However, the contribution of each of these putative causes to myocardial injury in this setting has not been determined. Thus far, no case of biopsy- or autopsy-proven viral myocarditis caused by COVID-19 has been reported; further investigation, including histologic examination of cardiac tissue from COVID-19 patients with the identification of findings of active myocarditis plus COVID-19 genome in heart tissue and/or identification of viral particles in cardiomyocytes in the absence of known cardiotropic viruses, is required to prove that COVID-19 is a novel cause of viral myocarditis. (See 'Definition and etiology' above.)●Myocardial injury (as reflected in elevated cardiac troponin levels) is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but the causes of myocardial injury have not been elucidated, and its contribution to incident heart failure has not been well characterized. Greater frequency and magnitude of troponin elevations are associated with more severe disease and worse outcomes. (See 'Myocardial injury' above.)●Incident heart failure may be common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Heart failure in patients with COVID-19 may be precipitated by acute illness in patients with preexisting known or undiagnosed heart disease (eg, coronary artery disease or hypertensive heart disease) or incident acute myocardial injury (eg, acute myocardial infarction, stress cardiomyopathy, and other possible etiologies described above). (See 'Heart failure' above.)●Most patients with COVID-19 with evidence of myocardial injury present with the typical symptoms and signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. A minority of patients with COVID-19 with evidence of myocardial injury present with cardiac symptoms (such as chest pain or palpitations). (See 'Clinical presentation' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●Patterns of troponin elevation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 include mild limited elevation (the most common pattern), a moderate time-limited elevation (which may approach or exceed the 99th percentile upper reference limit), and a progressive pattern with moderate elevation followed by a progressive elevation along with rise of other biomarkers consistent with cytokine storm. (See 'Troponin' above.)●If the clinical presentation is suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), timely evaluation is required to determine if urgent intervention is indicated. Evaluation of coronary disease in patients with COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See 'Diagnosis' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"".)●Most patients with COVID-19 without suspected ACS, with mild troponin elevation, and without acute heart failure can be clinically monitored without cardiac imaging. For patients who develop new onset heart failure, echocardiogram may be performed to evaluate regional and global ventricular and valvular function if this is requested by a consulting cardiologist and is expected to have a significant impact on management or is likely to change the patient's prognosis.

ID:127501,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the WHO and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [1,2]. (See 'Society guideline links' below.) This topic will provide an overview of infection control issues when caring for patients with COVID-19. The use of specific infection control precautions as they pertain to select specialties is presented elsewhere.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)OVERVIEW OF TRANSMISSION — Person-to-person spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, resembling the spread of influenza [3]. However, given the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, recommendations on airborne precautions in the health care setting vary by location. However, airborne precautions are universally recommended when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. (See 'Approach for most patients' below and 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' below.)There is also a risk of transmission when infectious droplets cause environmental contamination that in turn serves as a source of indirect (secondary) transmission when susceptible individuals touch these surfaces and then transfer virus to their mouths or other mucous membranes, such as the nose and conjunctiva, via their contaminated hands. Although the frequency and relative importance of environmental contamination in secondary transmission are unknown, environmental disinfection is an integral component of preventing spread of infection in the hospital and home setting. (See 'Environmental disinfection' below and 'Disinfection' below.) A more detailed discussion of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including the risk of asymptomatic transmission, is discussed in greater detail in a separate topic review. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)INFECTION CONTROL IN THE HEALTH CARE SETTING — Infection control interventions to reduce transmission of COVID-19 include universal source control (eg, covering the nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions), early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with COVID-19, and environmental disinfection. Limiting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. In an early report of COVID-19 in 138 patients from China, it was estimated that 43 percent acquired infection in the hospital setting [4]. In Washington State, suboptimal use of infection control procedures contributed to the spread of infection to 81 residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors in one long-term care facility [5]. Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnelScreening prior to and upon entry into the health care facility●Patients – Patients should be screened for clinical manifestations consistent with COVID-19 (eg, fever, cough, myalgias, sore throat, dyspnea, anosmia/hyposmia) prior to entry into a health care facility. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are presented in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.) Ideally, initial screening should be done over the phone before the patient actually presents to a facility. •Many patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 can be managed from home through telemedicine and will not need to enter the health care setting. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and 'Infection control in the home setting' below.) •For those who require additional evaluation, referral to a respiratory clinic dedicated to the evaluation and management of patients with presumptive COVID-19 is preferable. •However, if a dedicated clinic is not available or the patient requires a higher level of care (for COVID-19 or non-COVID-19-related symptoms), referral to an urgent care or emergency room may be needed. All patients should also be screened for respiratory symptoms upon entry into a health care setting. Separate waiting areas for patients with respiratory symptoms should be designated, with seating spaced such that patients are at least six feet (two meters) apart. Screening upon entry will also identify those who warrant additional infection control precautions. (See 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19' below.)●Visitors – During the COVID-19 pandemic, most hospitals have restricted visitors in the health care setting. Exempted visitors should also be screened for exposure to and symptoms of COVID-19; those with evidence of infection or a known exposure in the last fourteen days should not be allowed to enter the health care setting. ●Health care workers – The approach to screening health care workers entering the health care setting depends upon the institution's policies. In general, health care workers should monitor themselves for fever and symptoms of COVID-19 and stay home if they are ill. In one report of 48 health care workers with confirmed COVID-19 in King County, Washington, 65 percent reported working for a median of two days while exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 [6]. In addition, symptom screening alone did not identify all cases. Thus, additional measures, such as universal use of masks, are recommended. (See 'Universal use of masks' below.)Universal use of masks — All patients and any exempted visitors should be given face coverings upon entry into the health care setting (medical or cloth masks) for universal source control [7]. They should be asked to wear the mask throughout their visit. For patients who are admitted, the mask can usually be removed once the patient is in an appropriate room (eg, single room with the door closed for patients with suspected COVID-19). Additional considerations on the use of masks for patients with COVID-19 in the health care setting are discussed below. (See 'Approach for most patients' below.) Health care workers should also wear a face covering while in the hospital setting. ●A medical mask or respirator must be used when caring for patients. Additional information on the use of masks and other infection control measures when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 is discussed below. (See 'Approach for most patients' below.)●When supplies are limited, cloth face coverings may be reasonable for workers who do not engage in patient care and for providers when they are not involved in direct patient care activities [7]. Hand hygiene should be performed immediately before and after any contact with the face covering, including cloth coverings. Cloth masks should be changed if they become soiled, damp, or difficult to breathe through, and they should be laundered regularly (eg, daily and when soiled). The goal of universal masks is to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from unsuspected virus carriers [8,9]. Although there are no clinical data to support this approach, transmission of COVID-19 from health care workers has been reported [10], and in areas with widespread community transmission, symptom screening alone may not be sufficient, since presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can occur [11,12]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Person-to-person'.)Use of PPE for all patients with respiratory symptoms — All health care workers should use standard, contact, and droplet precautions (ie, gown, gloves, and medical mask), with eye or face protection when evaluating any patient with an undiagnosed respiratory infection, even those who are not under consideration for COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing'.)Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19Approach for most patients — The following infection control precautions should be used for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19:●Type of room – Patients should be placed in a single-occupancy room with a closed door and dedicated bathroom. When this is not possible, patients with confirmed COVID-19 can be housed together [7]. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 should not be in a positive-pressure room.An airborne infection isolation room (AII; ie, a single-patient, negative-pressure room) should be prioritized for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. Additional information on AII rooms, and what to do when these are not available, is found below. (See 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' below.) ●PPE for providers – All providers should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of exposure:•The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that standard, contact, and droplet precautions (ie, gown, gloves, and medical mask) with eye or face protection be used for all personnel entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 [13]. The addition of airborne precautions (ie, respirator) is warranted during aerosol-generating procedures. (See 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' below.) •The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines are similar, but recommend that an appropriate respirator (eg, an N95 respirator) be used instead of a medical mask. However, if the supply of respirators is limited, the CDC acknowledges medical masks are an acceptable alternative (in addition to contact precautions and eye protection) for most encounters, but respirators should be worn during aerosol-generating procedures [7]. (See 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' below.)Goggles or a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face should be used for eye protection; glasses are not sufficient. In addition, cloth face coverings are not considered PPE and should not be worn for the care of patients. Some institutions also require shoe covers for providers caring for patients on a dedicated COVID-19 ward or intensive care unit. In one report, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was widely distributed on floors, and contamination was greater in intensive care units than general wards, although whether this reflected infectious virus and its role in transmitting infection are unknown [14]. Hair covers may be used as well, but are usually not mandatory. Health care workers should pay special attention to the appropriate sequence of putting on (figure 1) and taking off (figure 2) PPE to avoid contamination. The CDC has created video demonstrations of the proper donning and doffing of PPE. Errors in removal of PPE are common, even in trained clinicians, and are associated with contamination of health care workers with pathogens [15]. In a Cochrane review that evaluated methods to increase compliance with donning and doffing of PPE, several interventions appeared to have some benefit in preventing contamination, including the use of CDC protocols and face-to-face training [16].As noted above, when supplies are available, the United States CDC recommends the use of N95 rather than medical masks when caring for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, since there remains uncertainty about the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 has been associated with severe infection, and there are no established treatments or vaccines. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)However, airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not clearly been documented, and several studies support the use of standard, contact, and droplet precautions with eye protection for most patients, with use of N95 respirators for those undergoing aerosol-generating procedures [17-20]. As an example, in a report from Hong Kong in which hospitals implemented empiric isolation, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and use of respirators for all aerosol-generating procedures (regardless of apparent patient risk factors), only 11 of 413 health care workers (2.7 percent) who cared for patients with COVID-19 had unprotected exposure and required quarantine, and none developed infection [17]. ●When patients should wear a mask – Patients should wear a medical mask if being transported out of the room (eg, for studies that cannot be performed in the room). In some institutions, when N95 respirators are not available for routine use, patients with COVID-19 are asked to wear a medical mask during face-to-face contact with health care workers, even when they are in their room, to lower their risk of transmitting infection. When this is done, health care workers must still use appropriate PPE, as described above. Approach in select settingsAerosol-generating procedures/treatments — In patients with COVID-19, aerosol-generating procedures should be avoided when possible to reduce the potential risk of transmission to health care workers. Although there is no consensus as to what constitutes an aerosol-generating procedure, in patients with COVID-19, these procedures typically include (listed alphabetically):●Bronchoscopy (including mini bronchoalveolar lavage)●Cardiopulmonary resuscitation●Colonoscopy●Filter changes on the ventilator●High-flow oxygen●Manual ventilation before intubation●Nasal endoscopy●Noninvasive ventilation ●Open suctioning of airways ●Tracheal intubation and extubation●Tracheotomy●Upper endoscopy (including transesophageal echocardiogram)●Swallowing evaluationSimilarly, inhaled medications should be administered by metered-dose inhaler when feasible, rather than through a nebulizer, to avoid the risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 through nebulization. If avoiding aerosol-generating procedures or use of a nebulizer is not possible, appropriate PPE for health care workers includes use of N95 or other respirators (eg, a powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) that offer a higher level of protection [7,13,21]. Other precautions include eye protection (eg, goggles or a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), gloves, and a gown.Aerosol-generating procedures should take place in an airborne infection isolation room (AII). These are single-patient rooms at negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas, and with a minimum of six air changes per hour (12 air changes per hour are recommended for new construction or renovation). When an AII room is not available, a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) unit can be placed in the room, although it does not compensate for the absence of negative air flow. In one institution, a negative-pressure canopy was used for patients receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), high-flow nasal cannula, and noninvasive ventilation [22].Health care workers and other personnel (eg, environmental services, maintenance) should not enter the room until sufficient time has passed since an aerosol-generating procedure to allow for removal of infectious particles. The rate of removal depends upon the number of air exchanges per hour, as described on the CDC website [23].Specimen collection for respiratory viral pathogens — In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, respiratory specimens for viral pathogens should be obtained in a single-occupancy room with the door closed, and visitors should not be present during specimen collection. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen collection is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure that warrants an airborne infection isolation room.When collecting a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen in a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the United States CDC recommends that health care workers in the room wear an N95 or higher level respirator (or medical mask if a respirator is not available), eye protection (eg, face shield or goggles), gloves, and a gown [24]. The CDC prefers a respirator, rather than a medical mask, as this is a novel virus and there is some uncertainty about airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Route of person-to-person transmission'.)However, when supplies are limited, respirators should be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures, as described above. (See 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' above.) When PPE is limited — Limited availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) has complicated medical care of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 (and other transmissible conditions) worldwide. The CDC has made a spreadsheet available that facilities can use to calculate their ""burn rate,"" or average daily usage rate for PPE, using the change in inventory.Optimizing the supply of PPE — In the United States, the CDC offers guidance on optimizing the supply of PPE when sudden increases in patient volume threaten a facility's PPE capacity [25]. Strategies include:●Canceling non-urgent procedures or visits that would warrant use of PPE and favoring home care rather than hospitalization when appropriate. ●Limiting movement outside the patient's room, prioritizing the use of certain PPE for the highest risk situations (eg, aerosol-generating procedures), and designating entire units within a facility to care for known or suspected patients with COVID-19 (ie, cohorting).●Minimizing face-to-face encounters with the patient, which can be done by excluding nonessential personnel and visitors, limiting the number of people who examine the patient, using medications with extended intervals to reduce nursing encounters, and allowing some providers to perform telephone interviews with hospitalized patients. In some facilities, patients can convey needs to providers using tablets or other electronic interfaces, further reducing some in-person interactions. ●Utilizing alternatives to N95s, such as elastomeric half-mask and full-facepiece air-purifying respirators, as well as PAPRs [26-28].In a crisis situation, cautious extended or limited reuse of PPE may be reasonable. As an example, the same medical mask can be used for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients (assuming it is not visibly damaged or soiled) [29]. When this strategy is used, the provider should not touch or remove the mask between patient encounters, since the outside surface is presumably contaminated. If the provider does touch the mask, they must immediately perform hand hygiene. The CDC suggests that masks can be used for 8 to 12 hours [29], whereas the WHO states medical masks can be used for up to six hours when caring for a cohort of patients with COVID-19 [30]. More detailed information on extended use and reuse of medical masks and N95 respirators can be found on the CDC and WHO websites [25,29-31].Decontamination of PPE for reuse — There has been interest in decontamination of personal protective equipment (PPE) for reuse, in particular for N95 respirators. In some centers, decontamination of face shields is also being performed.The CDC and WHO have highlighted several methods for decontamination of respirators when supplies are critically low (crisis standards) [30,32]. These include:●Ultraviolet light – Decontamination with ultraviolet (UV) light was evaluated in the context of the H1N1 influenza pandemic; in experimental models, UV irradiation was observed to reduce H1N1 influenza viability on N95 respirator surfaces at doses below the threshold observed to impair the integrity of the respirator [33-35]. Coronaviruses can also be inactivated by UV irradiation, but comparable studies have not been performed with SARS-CoV-2, and the dose needed to inactivate the virus on a respirator surface is unknown. Nebraska Medicine has implemented a protocol for UV irradiation of N95 respirators in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic based on the dose generally needed to inactivate other single-stranded RNA viruses on surfaces [36]. ●Hydrogen peroxide vapor – Duke University Health System is using hydrogen peroxide vapor for N95 decontamination [37]. Hydrogen peroxide vapor has been observed to inactivate other non-coronavirus single-stranded RNA viruses on environmental surfaces [38,39]. In the United States, The US Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for use of low-temperature vaporous hydrogen peroxide sterilizers, used for medical instruments, to decontaminate N95 respirators [40].●Moist heat – Moist heat has been observed to reduce the concentration of H1N1 influenza virus on N95 respirator surfaces [34]. In this study, moist heat was applied by preparing a container with 1 L of tap water in the bottom and a dry horizontal rack above the water; the container was sealed and warmed in an oven to 65°C/150°F for at least three hours; it was then opened, the respirator placed on the rack, and the container resealed and placed back in the oven for an additional 30 minutes. No residual H1N1 infectivity was found. The optimal time and temperature to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 are uncertain; several studies observed inactivation of SARS-CoV after 30 to 60 minutes at 60°C/140°F [41-43]. Ethylene oxide is also used for decontaminating PPE in some institutions. The CDC cautions that off-gassing from ethylene oxide-treated PPE could be harmful to the wearer [32], but some facilities have taken steps to verify safe concentrations prior to deploying this method. If decontamination of PPE is done, staff should be cautioned to not wear makeup, use lotions or beard oils, or write on masks, as they make decontamination difficult or impossible. Environmental disinfection — To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, environmental infection control procedures should be implemented [7,13,44-46]. In United States health care settings, the CDC states routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 [7]. Products approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for emerging viral pathogens should be used; a list of EPA-registered products can be found here. Specific guidance on environmental measures, including those used in the home setting, is available on the CDC and WHO websites. Many hospitals have implemented enhanced environmental cleaning and disinfection protocols for rooms used by patients with known or suspected COVID-19, and for areas used by health care workers caring for such patients, to prevent secondary transmission from fomites. As an example, adjunctive disinfection methods, such as UV light and hydrogen peroxide vapor, are used in some facilities to disinfect the rooms that have housed or been used for aerosol-generating procedures on patients with COVID-19. Environmental services workers who are cleaning areas potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 should be trained to conduct the cleaning in appropriate PPE [7]. Workers should be fit tested and trained to wear N95 respirators and face shields (or PAPRs) when cleaning patient rooms that are or have been occupied by persons with known or suspected COVID-19 or have been used for aerosol-generating procedures on patients with COVID-19. Environmental services workers can use droplet and contact precautions, plus eye protection (surgical mask, face shield or goggles, gown, and gloves) when cleaning areas used by health care workers who are caring for COVID-19 patients.The importance of environmental disinfection was illustrated in a study from Singapore, in which viral RNA was detected on nearly all surfaces tested (handles, light switches, bed and handrails, interior doors and windows, toilet bowl, sink basin) in the airborne infection isolation room of a patient with symptomatic mild COVID-19 prior to routine cleaning [47]. Viral RNA was not detected on similar surfaces in the rooms of two other symptomatic patients following routine cleaning (with sodium dichloroisocyanurate). Of note, viral RNA detection does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus. The role of environmental contamination in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Environmental contamination'.) Patients who have had an exposure to COVID-19 — Some patients who require hospitalization for a reason unrelated to COVID-19 may have had close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, including during the 48 hours prior to that patient developing symptoms. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)In this setting, clinicians should use infection control precautions similar to those used for patients with suspected disease, as described above; however, such patients should not be cohorted or share a room with patients who have COVID-19. (See 'Approach for most patients' above.) Patients should continue infection control precautions specific for COVID-19 for the duration of their quarantine (14 days after their last contact with the patient).Some institutions are testing asymptomatic patients after an exposure. However, a negative test does not rule out subsequent development of infection with SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, infection control precautions should be continued for the duration of the incubation period, despite a negative result. INFECTION CONTROL IN THE HOME SETTING — Home management is appropriate for patients with mild infection who can be adequately isolated in the outpatient setting [44,48,49]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)Management of such patients should include instructions on how to prevent transmission to others. Isolation at home — Outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (including those awaiting test results) should stay at home and try to separate themselves from other people and animals in the household [50]. They should also avoid having visitors enter the home. Patients should wear a face cover if they must be in the same room (or vehicle) as other people. Some authorities recommend a medical mask [51]; however, when supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) are limited, a cloth face cover should be used. Detailed information on the use of cloth face covers can be found on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. A caregiver can also wear a face cover when around the patient, but if a cloth face cover is used, it is unclear how much protection it provides to the wearer. Other steps to reduce transmission in the home include [51-54]:●Limiting the number of caregivers and, if possible, using caregivers who do not have risk factors for developing severe disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)●Having patients use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available. ●Minimizing patients' exposure to shared spaces and ensuring shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as an air conditioner or an opened window. When sharing spaces cannot be avoided, patients and caregivers should try to remain six feet (two meters) apart, if possible, and face covers should be used.●Ensuring caregivers perform hand hygiene after any type of contact with patients or their immediate environment. In addition, caregivers should wear gloves when touching the patient's blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, and urine. ●Educating caregivers on how to carefully put on and take off PPE. As an example, caregivers should first remove and dispose of gloves, and then immediately clean their hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. After that, the face cover (if used) should be removed, and the caregiver should again perform hand hygiene. ●Instructing family members to avoid sharing dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with the patient. After the patient uses these items, they should be washed thoroughly; disposable gloves should be worn when handling these items. In addition, thermometers should not be shared, or should be thoroughly disinfected before use by other household members.More detailed recommendations on home management of patients with COVID-19 can be found on the World Health Organization and CDC websites [44,45,55]. Disinfection — Disinfection of frequently touched surfaces is also important. In the home, high-touch surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected daily. These include tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remote controls, handles, desks, toilets, and sinks. For disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and most common Environmental Protection Agency-registered household disinfectants are thought to be effective. More detailed information on how to clean and disinfect, including guidance for patients, is found on the CDC and World Health Organization websites [52,56].DISCONTINUATION OF PRECAUTIONS — The decision to discontinue infection control precautions for patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 should be made in consultation with experts in infection prevention and control and public health officials. If patients are ready to be discharged home prior to meeting criteria for discontinuation of precautions, they can be sent home with instructions to self-isolate until they meet either test-based or non-test-based criteria. Special considerations for health care workers are discussed below. (See 'After infection' below.)Patients with confirmed infectionSymptomatic patients — Test-based and symptom-based strategies can be used to inform when infection control precautions should be discontinued in patients with COVID-19 [57-59]. Symptom-based strategies allow for discontinuation of precautions after symptom resolution and specific time intervals, whereas a test-based strategy requires resolution of symptoms and two negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on sequential nasopharyngeal specimens collected ≥24 hours apart [60]. For patients in a health care setting, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests the following test- or symptom-based strategies [59]. A discussion about which strategy to use is found below. (See 'Deciding whether to use a test- or non-test-based strategy' below.)●When a test-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue isolation when there is:•Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications AND•Improvement in respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) AND•Negative results of a US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens)There is no clear guidance as to when repeat testing should be performed. We obtain the first test once the patient has met the criteria for the symptom-based strategy. If the first test is positive, a second test should be obtained after 72 hours. If negative, the second test is obtained 24 hours later. ●When a symptom-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue isolation when the following criteria are met:•At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared AND•At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms [eg, cough, shortness of breath])When a symptom-based strategy is used, it may be reasonable to continue precautions or extend the period of isolation beyond the 10 days in patients who are likely to remain infectious for longer periods of time, such as immunocompromised patients. This should be determined on a case-by-case basis. For patients who are being cared for outside of a health care setting, the CDC uses similar criteria, but when a symptom-based strategy is used, they state only seven days must have passed since symptoms first appeared (rather than 10) [57]. The seven-day duration was previously used for patients in health care settings as well and was updated based on evidence on duration of viral shedding; the duration for home-based isolation has not yet been updated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.)Protocols in other countries and at specific institutions may differ; as an example, when a non-test-based strategy is used, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests home isolation for patients with documented COVID-19 be continued for at least two weeks after symptom resolution [52]. Information on other institutional protocols is found elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)Asymptomatic patients — Some patients may have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without any symptoms when they were tested. ●In health care settings, a test-based or time-based strategy can be used [59]. If a time-based strategy is used, infection control precautions can be discontinued when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 test as long as there was no evidence of subsequent illness. A discussion about which strategy to use is found below. (See 'Deciding whether to use a test- or non-test-based strategy' below.)●In patients who are being cared for at home, the CDC states home isolation can be discontinued when at least seven days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 test (assuming no symptoms developed), but patients should continue to limit contact with other individuals and wear a face cover when around others for another three days after isolation is discontinued. In community settings, this may be a cloth face cover [57]. Additional considerations for health care workers are found on the CDC website.Deciding whether to use a test- or non-test-based strategy — The decision to use a test- or non-test-based strategy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, since each strategy has potential limitations.As an example, the use of non-test-based strategies may not prevent all instances of secondary spread. These strategies that use time since diagnosis or time since illness onset and recovery are based upon findings that transmission is most likely to occur in the early stage of infection. However, data are limited, particularly in immunocompromised patients [57,58]. By contrast, a test-based strategy may unnecessarily prolong the need for infection control precautions and isolation, since there have been reports of prolonged detection of RNA without direct correlation to viral culture. In a German study of nine patients with mild infection, no infectious virus was found in respiratory specimens after day 8 of symptoms despite the detection of high titers of viral RNA through the third week, suggesting prolonged shedding of viral RNA is not necessarily reflective of transmissibility [61].A more detailed discussion of viral shedding and the period of infectivity is found in a separate topic review. (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity')Suspected cases with negative initial testing — In some patients, initial testing is negative, but there is still suspicion for COVID-19. In this setting, a second test should be performed, and infection control precautions should be continued pending the result. When two tests are negative, precautions can often be discontinued; however, if concern for COVID-19 remains high, such as in a patient with consistent clinical symptoms and an exposure to a person with known or suspected COVID-19, infection control precautions should be continued at least until criteria for discontinuation of precautions using a symptom-based strategy are met. (See 'Symptomatic patients' above.)The accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 testing have not been systematically evaluated, and a single negative test may not sufficiently exclude the diagnosis. In addition, the quality of nasopharyngeal swab collection may vary. Additional information on diagnostic testing is presented elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Suspected cases when testing was not performed — In some cases, testing for COVID-19 may not be accessible, particularly for individuals who have a compatible but mild illness that does not warrant hospitalization. In areas where community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is widespread, these patients are often treated presumptively for COVID-19 (eg, home isolation, supportive care) and the decision to discontinue transmission-based precautions should be made using the symptom-based strategy described above. (See 'Symptomatic patients' above.)ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONSReturn to work for health care workersAfter potential or known exposure — For health care workers who have had a potential exposure to COVID-19, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided guidelines for work restriction and monitoring. The approach depends upon the duration of exposure, the patient's symptoms, whether the patient was wearing a medical mask, the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) used by the provider, and whether an aerosol-generating procedure was performed. Some local health departments allow asymptomatic health care workers to return to work following an exposure if they adhere to cough and hand hygiene, wear a medical mask while at the health care facility until 14 days after the exposure, and monitor daily for fever or respiratory symptoms, the presence of which would prompt immediate self-isolation [62]. After infection — For health care workers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, decisions about return to work should be made in the context of the provider's local circumstances (eg, availability of testing, staffing shortages) [63]. Test- or non-test-based strategies can be used. More detailed information regarding criteria for return to work, as well as return to work practices and work restrictions, is found on the CDC website.Long-term care facilities — Similar to other health care settings, certain measures should be used for all patients, visitors, and providers entering the facility. These include symptom screening and use of face covers for everyone entering the facility, regardless of symptoms. In addition, standard, contact, and droplet precautions, as well as eye protection, should be used for any patient with an undiagnosed respiratory infection [64]. A more detailed discussion of infection control precautions can be found above. (See 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel' above and 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19' above.)Additional strategies to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection in long-term care facilities include limiting visitors except in rare circumstances (eg, compassionate care situations), screening staff daily for symptoms before entering the facility, discontinuing use of common dining rooms and canceling all group activities, and monitoring the clinical status and vital signs of all residents at least three times per 24-hour period, including daily temperature measurements [65-67]. Since older adults with COVID-19 may not show typical symptoms (eg, fever or respiratory symptoms), the CDC recommends that a temperature >100.0°F, as well as the presence of atypical symptoms, such as worsening malaise, new dizziness, or diarrhea, prompt isolation and further evaluation for COVID-19 [64].Once an outbreak has occurred, the facility should identify an area to care for residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and dedicated staff should be assigned to work only in that area of the facility. Roommates who have been exposed but are asymptomatic should not be placed with another roommate until 14 days after their exposure, assuming they have not developed symptoms or had a positive test. If the facility has airborne infection isolation rooms (ie, single-patient, negative-pressure rooms), they should be prioritized for patients who require aerosol-generating procedures (eg, patients with tracheostomies requiring nebulizer treatments). When this is not possible, a private room should be used, with a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available.Additional information on infection control in long-term care facilities can be found on the CDC website. Dialysis — Similar to other health care settings, dialysis centers should identify patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection (eg, fever, cough) before they enter the treatment area. If a patient has suspected infection when they arrive, they should be placed in a private room. If that is not possible, they should wear a mask and be separated by at least six feet (two meters) from the nearest patient. Staff should wear PPE as described above. A more detailed discussion of infection control in dialysis centers is presented in a separate topic review. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis'.)Role of serologic testing — Serologic tests, as soon as generally available and adequately evaluated, should be able to identify patients who have a prolonged illness (eg, greater than 14 days) and a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, as well as those who had previous infection. However, these tests are not useful for assessing the presence of infection in an exposed patient and, until their sensitivity and specificity are further assessed, they should not be used for determining the use of infection control precautions. Additional information on serologic testing is presented elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Serology to identify prior infection'.) Preventing infection in the community — To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, individuals should be advised to practice diligent hand hygiene, as well as respiratory hygiene (eg, covering their cough), and to avoid close contact with ill individuals, if possible. In addition, residents should greet each other without contact, refrain from shaking hands, and avoid gathering in groups. If community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is present, residents should be encouraged to practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave home. In some locations, face coverings are advised in public settings. Additional measures are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.) SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). (See 'Introduction' above.)●Limiting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This includes universal source control (eg, covering the nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions), early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with COVID-19, and environmental disinfection. (See 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel' above and 'Infection control in the health care setting' above and 'Infection control in the home setting' above.)●Person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, resembling the spread of influenza. However, given the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, airborne precautions are recommended in certain settings. Thus, in hospitalized patients, the following types of infection control precautions should be used for those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (see 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19' above):•Patients should ideally be placed in a single-occupancy room with a closed door and dedicated bathroom; however, when this is not possible, patients with confirmed COVID-19 can be housed together. An airborne infection isolation room (ie, a single-patient negative-pressure room) should be prioritized for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. (See 'Approach for most patients' above and 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' above.)•Standard, contact, and droplet precautions (ie, gown, gloves, and medical mask), with eye or face protection (eg, face shield or goggles) should be used for all personnel entering the room. An N95 respirator should be used for all aerosol-generating procedures. In the United States, an N95 respirator is preferred for all settings, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that medical masks are an acceptable alternative when PPE is limited. (See 'Approach for most patients' above and 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments' above and 'When PPE is limited' above.)•Health care workers should pay special attention to the appropriate sequence of putting on (figure 1) and taking off (figure 2) PPE to avoid contamination. (See 'Approach for most patients' above.)•When availability of PPE is limited, strategies to preserve the supply include canceling non-urgent procedures or visits that would warrant use of PPE and prioritizing the use of certain PPE for the highest risk situations. Cautious extended or limited reuse of PPE and decontamination of PPE for reuse can also be considered in select situations. (See 'When PPE is limited' above.)●In some hospitalized patients, initial testing is negative, but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains high. In this setting, additional testing should be performed to help inform the decision to continue transmission-based precautions. (See 'Suspected cases with negative initial testing' above.)●To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, environmental infection control procedures should be implemented in both health care and home settings. Products approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for emerging viral pathogens should be used; a list of EPA-registered products can be found here. (See 'Environmental disinfection' above and 'Disinfection' above.)●Outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (including those awaiting test results) who do not require hospitalization should stay at home and separate themselves from other people and animals in the household. Other strategies to help prevent transmission within the household include use of face covers, not sharing items such as dishes, towels, and bedding, and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces. (See 'Infection control in the home setting' above.)●In symptomatic patients with confirmed COVID-19, test-based or symptom-based strategies can be used to inform when transmission-based precautions should be discontinued. If patients are ready to be discharged home prior to meeting criteria for discontinuation of precautions, they can be sent home with instructions to self-isolate until the criteria are met. (See 'Discontinuation of precautions' above.)●In patients who were presumptively diagnosed with COVID-19 based upon a compatible illness but were not tested, the decision to discontinue transmission-based precautions should be made using the symptom-based strategy. (See 'Suspected cases when testing was not performed' above.)●Some patients may have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without any symptoms when they were tested. For such patients, a test- or time-based strategy can be used to discontinue infection control precautions, as long as there was no evidence of subsequent illness.

ID:127552,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (ie, SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. By 2020, it led to a pandemic that has spread throughout most countries of the world. SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) primarily manifests as a lung infection with symptoms ranging from those of a mild upper respiratory infection to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. COVID-19 disproportionately affects patients with pre-existing comorbidities, such as patients with various types of kidney disease. All medical professionals, including nephrology clinicians, are tasked with rapidly adjusting their practice to curtail the spread of the virus, while providing life-sustaining care to their patients.This topic will discuss issues related to COVID-19 and delivery of nephrology care in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypertension. Other important aspects of COVID-19 that may affect this population are discussed at length elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".) ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Fluid and electrolytes management'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)END-STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE — Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 due to the older age and high frequency of comorbidity, such as diabetes and hypertension, in this population [1]. Management of patients with ESKD varies based upon whether they are hospitalized or are in the outpatient setting. Outpatients with ESKD — A majority of patients with ESKD are treated with some form of dialysis. These include in-center hemodialysis, home hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis — Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis typically present to an outpatient facility three times per week to undergo dialysis. This limits their ability to observe physical isolation for infection control. Thus, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Society of Nephrology (ASN), and International Society of Nephrology (ISN) have issued interim guidelines and a list of resources to guide nephrology clinicians providing life-sustaining dialysis care [2,3]. These resources continue to evolve and are frequently updated. At a minimum, all dialysis organizations are urged to follow the recommendations from these guidelines. Some dialysis organizations may choose to follow additional measures to protect the health care staff and patients, depending upon their access to personal protective equipment and other resources.Early recognition/isolation of individuals with respiratory symptoms — Outpatient dialysis facilities should, at minimum, heed the following guidance [4]: ●Implement non-punitive and flexible sick leave policies that permit ill health care personnel to stay home. Health care personnel should be reminded to not report to work when they are ill. ●Identify patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection (eg, fever, cough) before they enter the treatment area.•Instruct patients to call ahead to report fever or respiratory symptoms so the facility can be prepared for their arrival or triage them to a more appropriate setting (eg, an acute care hospital).•Patients should inform staff of fever or respiratory symptoms immediately upon arrival at the facility (eg, when they check in at the registration desk).•Patients with symptoms of a respiratory infection should put on a facemask at check-in and should wear it until they leave the facility.●Provide patients and health care personnel with instructions (in appropriate languages) regarding hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette.•Instructions should include how to use facemasks, how to use tissues to cover the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, how to dispose of tissues and contaminated items in waste receptacles, and how and when to perform hand hygiene.•Signs should be posted at clinic entrances with instructions for patients to alert staff so appropriate precautions can be implemented for patients who have a fever or symptoms of a respiratory infection.●Position hygiene-related supplies in close proximity to dialysis chairs and nursing stations to enable adherence to hand and respiratory hygiene. These supplies include tissues and no-touch receptacles for disposal of tissues as well as hand hygiene supplies (eg, alcohol-based hand sanitizer).Patient placement — Outpatient dialysis facilities should, at minimum, heed the following guidance: ●Provide sufficient space in waiting areas for patients to sit separated from other patients by at least six feet. Medically stable patients might opt to wait in a personal vehicle or outside the health care facility where they can be contacted by mobile phone when it is their turn to be seen.•Patients with respiratory symptoms should be brought back to an appropriate treatment area as soon as possible in order to minimize time in waiting areas.•If possible, facilities should maintain at least six feet of separation between patients. If not possible, then six feet of separation should be maintained between masked, symptomatic patients and other patients during dialysis treatments. Ideally, symptomatic patients would be dialyzed in a separate room (if available) with the door closed.-Hepatitis B isolation rooms should be used for dialysis patients with symptoms of respiratory infection only if the room is not needed to dialyze a hepatitis B infected patient. -If a separate room is not available, masked patients should be dialyzed in corner or end-of-row stations and be separated from other patients in all directions by at least six feet.Personal protective equipment — In general, health care personnel caring for patients with undiagnosed respiratory infections should follow standard, contact, and droplet precautions with eye protection unless the suspected diagnosis requires airborne precautions (eg, tuberculosis). This includes the use of:•Gloves•Facemask•Eye protection (eg, goggles, a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face). Personal glasses and contact lenses are not considered adequate eye protection.•Isolation gown-The isolation gown should be worn over or instead of the cover gown (ie, laboratory coat, gown, or apron with incorporate sleeves) that is normally worn by health care personnel. If the supply of such gowns is low, then they should be prioritized for the initiation and termination of the hemodialysis treatment, manipulation of access needles or catheters, and for aiding the patient into and out of the station. They should also be used for cleaning and disinfection of patient care equipment and the dialysis station.-When gowns are removed, place the gown in a dedicated container for waste or linen before leaving the dialysis station. Disposable gowns should be discarded after use. Cloth gowns should be laundered after each use.Additional measures for COVID-19 — When COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed in a patient receiving hemodialysis at the facility, the following additional measures apply:●If a hemodialysis facility is dialyzing more than one patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, an attempt should be made to cohort these patients, as well as the health care personnel caring for them, together in the same section of the unit and/or on the same shift (eg, schedule all such patients for the last shift of the day). If the etiology of respiratory symptoms is known, patients with different etiologies should not be cohorted together; as an example, patients with confirmed influenza and COVID-19 should not be cohorted together.●The health department should be notified about the patient.●Health care personnel should follow the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings. This includes recommendations on personal protective equipment. Routine cleaning and disinfection are appropriate for COVID-19 in dialysis settings. Any surface, supplies, or equipment (eg, dialysis machine) located within six feet of symptomatic patients should be disinfected or discarded.•Products with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are recommended for use against SARS-CoV-2. Refer to List N on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA's emerging viral pathogens program from use against SARS-CoV-2.•When using products from List N, facilities should ensure the products also have a bloodborne pathogen claim (eg, hepatitis B, HIV).Patients receiving home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis — Our approach to patients receiving home dialysis is as follows:●In general, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients receiving dialysis at home (ie, home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) should have their regular follow-up visits performed via telemedicine rather than via in-person, in-clinic visits. In addition, home visits by health care professionals should be minimized or stopped.Patients should have at least two weeks of dialysis supplies and sufficient medications in case they have to self-isolate, or in case there is a break in the supply chain (eg, due to delivery staff sickness).Staff nurses should communicate with patients frequently to distinguish and handle the most dangerous and severe cases in a timely manner and by referring patients to the emergency department, when appropriate. Unexpected or emergency visits to the clinic should be avoided as much as possible.●However, patients occasionally may need to be seen in-person for various issues (eg, home hemodialysis training, suspected exit-site infection, suspected peritonitis). If an in-person visit is clinically indicated:•Attempt to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This includes early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, as well as the use of appropriate personal protective equipment. A detailed discussion of infection control practices for the health care setting is presented separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)•Attempt to limit the number of patients seen in-person during a given day in order to avoid crowded waiting areas and to minimize contact. •Avoid non-essential procedures in order to minimize unnecessary patient contact. In the peritoneal dialysis unit, for example, procedures such as peritoneal equilibration test (PET) testing and clearance measurements should be deferred. However, procedures that are necessary for placement and maintenance of adequate dialysis access (eg, arteriovenous fistula procedures, placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter) are considered essential and should not be deferred. (See 'Dialysis access planning in advanced CKD' below.)Hospitalized patients with ESKD — The American Society of Nephrology has issued guidelines for nephrology clinicians caring for hospitalized patients requiring dialysis for ESKD. In addition, the CDC has issued interim guidance for care of hospitalized patients, which are applicable for those hospitalized with kidney disease. These guidelines continue to evolve and are frequently updated. Understandably, the execution of some of these guidelines will be limited by policies enforced at the level of any institution. However, when possible, adherence to these guidelines is encouraged.●Patients with COVID-19 should be co-localized on a floor or intensive care unit, when possible. Co-localization within adjacent rooms can enable one dialysis nurse to simultaneously deliver dialysis for more than one patient.●When possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are not critically ill should be dialyzed in their own isolation room rather than being transported to the inpatient dialysis unit.●Where available, telemedicine interfaces with a camera should be used to troubleshoot alarms from outside the room and to minimize the need for the dialysis nurse or the nephrologist to enter an isolation room.Patients receiving intermittent peritoneal dialysis who have multiple organ dysfunction can be temporarily switched to automated peritoneal dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). As in patients on hemodialysis, it is advisable to prevent hypervolemia, so increased ultrafiltration may be needed if remaining on peritoneal dialysis.There are a variety of opinions for disposal of drained dialysate from peritoneal dialysis patients with COVID-19 ranging from only performing standard methods to additional disinfection with mixture of 500 mg/L chlorine-containing solution with the dialysate and disposing the dialysate into the toilet after one hour. It is important to emphasize the need to prevent accidental splash when disposing of drained dialysate.ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY — Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may present with acute kidney injury (AKI) as part of their overall illness. In observational data from Wuhan, AKI has been reported in 25 to 29 percent of patients who were critically ill or deceased [5,6]. The incidence of AKI among infected patients (including those with and without critical illness) is approximately 5 percent [7]. However, these data are too preliminary to definitively establish the true incidence of AKI associated with COVID-19.Clinical characteristics and histopathology — Kidney disease among patients with COVID-19 can manifest as AKI, hematuria, or proteinuria, and portends a higher risk of mortality [7-10]. It remains unclear if AKI is largely due to hemodynamic changes and cytokine release or if the virus also leads to direct cytotoxicity. In a single-center prospective cohort study of 701 patients, of which 13 percent had pre-existing kidney disease, AKI occurred in five percent [7]. In addition, 44 percent had proteinuria and 27 percent had hematuria. The presence of AKI, hematuria, or proteinuria, and pre-existing kidney disease were independently associated with a higher risk of death. Kidney histopathology was examined in an autopsy series of 26 patients who died of respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 [9]. Mean age of the patients included was 69 years (range, 39 to 87 years); eleven patients had diabetes, hypertension, and/or chronic kidney disease at baseline, and nine had new kidney injury during hospitalization in the form of creatinine elevation or new-onset proteinuria. All patients had evidence of acute tubular injury (of varying severity); a range of other histopathology findings, such as erythrocyte clusters and pigmented casts, were also present. Of the nine samples tested for intracellular virus, particles resembling coronaviruses were identified in seven. Of these seven patients, immunostaining was positive for SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody in three. Two separate case reports have also described collapsing glomerulopathy among black patients presenting with severe AKI and nephrotic-range proteinuria [8,10].Evaluation of AKI in hospitalized patients — In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who develop AKI, an emphasis should be placed on optimization of volume status to exclude and treat prerenal (functional) AKI while avoiding hypervolemia, which may worsen the patient's respiratory status.The evaluation for other AKI etiologies should be undertaken in a manner similar to other critically ill patients with AKI. As an example, manual urine sediment examination should be performed, if appropriate, since urine samples are not considered to be highly infectious. However, some testing that is typically available may not be possible in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. As an example, kidney and bladder ultrasound may not be able to be performed due to exposure concerns.Management of AKI in hospitalized patientsPatients with dialysis-requiring AKI — The indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT) for AKI remain the same regardless of the COVID-19 status of any given patient. Alterations in RRT management that might be undertaken during the COVID-19 outbreak include the following:●Patients with COVID-19 and AKI who require RRT should be co-localized on a floor or intensive care unit, when possible. Co-localization within adjacent rooms can enable one dialysis nurse to simultaneously deliver dialysis to more than one patient. If a patient is in a negative-pressure isolation room, then one hemodialysis nurse will need to be dedicated for the care of that patient in a 1:1 nurse-to-patient ratio.●If at all possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are not critically ill but who have AKI requiring RRT should be dialyzed in their isolation room rather than being transported to the inpatient dialysis unit.●Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains preferred among critically ill patients with AKI. Even among patients who are hemodynamically stable and could tolerate intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), CRRT or prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT; also called sustained low-efficiency dialysis or SLED) should be performed instead, depending upon machine and staffing availability. This is because CRRT or PIRRT can be managed without 1:1 hemodialysis nursing support. This would potentially help minimize wastage of personal protective equipment and limit exposure among hemodialysis nurses.●CRRT machines can either be placed inside an isolation room as per standard practice or outside the room with the use of extended tubing. Placing the machine outside of the room minimizes the need for repeated entry to troubleshoot and manage the machine, and therefore reduces wastage of personal protective equipment. However, extended tubing is a scarce resource. In addition, use of extended tubing requires additional tubing connections and increases the likelihood that tubing will become disconnected. Extended tubing also decreases the sensitivity of pressure alarms to detect disconnection of the venous lines, and potentially increases the risk of clotting due to the longer tubing length.  ●If CRRT capacity at an institution is overwhelmed, CRRT machines can be used to deliver prolonged intermittent treatments (eg, 10 hours rather than continuous) with higher flow rates (eg, 40 to 50 mL/kg/hour). Alternatively, the machine can be rotated between patients every 24 hours or whenever the circuit clots, so that use of new filter sets is minimized. This will enable the CRRT machine to become available sooner for care of another patient after terminal cleaning.●Institutions facing scarcity of replacement fluid for CRRT can lower the delivered dose to 15 mL/kg/hour from the standard 20 to 25 mL/kg/hour, especially among patients who are not hypercatabolic. When supplies of commercially prepared replacement fluid are exhausted, institutional pharmacies may develop their own replacement fluid by mixing all of the following (in a sterile fashion) [11]:•1 L of 0.9 percent saline with potassium chloride as needed•1 L of 5 percent dextrose water with 150 mEq sodium bicarbonate•1 L of 0.9 percent saline with 1 g magnesium chloride•1 L of 0.9 percent saline with 1 g calcium chlorideThis will yield a 4 L solution containing 153 mEq/L sodium, 37.5 mEq/L bicarbonate, 2.6 mmol/L magnesium, 2.25 mmol/L calcium, and a variable amount of potassium.Another option for preparation of a dialysate solution is the Cleveland Clinic method. ●Anecdotal evidence suggests that circuit thrombosis during RRT occurs more frequently in patients with COVID-19 than in other patients. In the absence of contraindications, patients with COVID-19 should receive anticoagulation during RRT. This can be in the form of regional anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin or citrate, or systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular weight heparin. Institutions that have no prior experience with regional citrate anticoagulation should avoid adopting a new citrate protocol during this crisis in order to minimize risks of treatment errors that can lead to citrate toxicity. Additional details regarding anticoagulation for the hemodialysis procedure are presented separately. (See ""Anticoagulation for the hemodialysis procedure"" and ""Anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy"".) ●Where available, remote monitoring with audio and video streams should be used to troubleshoot alarms from outside the room and to minimize the need for the dialysis nurse or the nephrologist to enter an isolation room.●No special provisions or methods for disposal of the CRRT effluent are necessary. This is because neither presence of SARS-CoV-2 nor other similar viruses have been demonstrated in the effluent. ●When available hemodialysis or CRRT machines are scarce, clinicians may need to consider treatment of AKI with peritoneal dialysis. Important considerations include: •Patients with AKI who are treated with peritoneal dialysis have similar rates of all-cause mortality, kidney function recovery, and infectious complications compared with patients treated with other modalities. (See ""Use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults"", section on 'Outcomes with PD for AKI'.)•Peritoneal dialysis requires relatively less equipment, infrastructure, and resources relative to other forms of RRT. Nurses and clinicians can be trained expeditiously to provide peritoneal dialysis. (See ""Use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults"", section on 'Outcomes with PD for AKI'.)•Peritoneal dialysis can increase intra-abdominal pressure, interfere with respiratory mechanics [12], and may theoretically worsen respiratory failure, particularly among mechanically ventilated patients. However, it can be used among mechanically ventilated patients when other options such as intermittent hemodialysis and CRRT are not available. Performing peritoneal dialysis in a mechanically ventilated patient who requires a prone position may be challenging, although one case report found it to be feasible and safe [13]. (See ""Use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults"", section on 'Complications of PD for AKI'.)•When peritoneal dialysis is used for management of AKI in patients with COVID-19, automated peritoneal dialysis with a cycler should be used, if available. This minimizes the contact between health care personnel and the patient. (See ""Use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults"", section on 'Selecting PD modalities for AKI'.)•Similar to disposal of peritoneal dialysis effluent for patients with end-stage kidney disease, there are a range of opinions for safe disposal of the effluent in the setting of AKI. Data suggesting that peritoneal dialysis effluent is infectious are lacking. (See 'Hospitalized patients with ESKD' above.)●Extracorporeal hemoperfusion devices for cytokine removal, such as Cytosorb, have had no clear role in management of sepsis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to lack of proven benefit, we do not use Cytosorb or other similar devices among critically ill COVID-19 patients with or without dialysis-requiring AKI. (See ""Investigational and ineffective therapies for sepsis"", section on 'Cytokine and endotoxin inactivation or removal'.)Data regarding the threshold for SARS-CoV-2 testing (eg, benefits of testing patients with mild symptoms not requiring hospitalization), or about safety of antiviral agents for treatment of COVID-19 among patients with kidney disease remains unknown. Patients with AKI that is not dialysis-requiring — Patients who have AKI that is not dialysis-requiring should be managed with limited contact as much as possible. Physical examination and ultrasound evaluations should be coordinated with the primary/consulting teams to minimize contact, when possible. Differences in management of AKI among patients with COVID-19 may include limited use of intravenous fluids. Most patients with COVID-19 characterized by pneumonia have variable degree of oxygen requirements and/or airway control. Fluid resuscitation goals are understandably conservative as per various acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria. Thus, fluid resuscitation should be individualized and based on trackable objective measures (eg, inferior vena cava collapse on ultrasound). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Fluid and electrolytes management'.)CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION — Among patients with COVID-19, both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension are risk factors for more severe disease [14,15]:●In a meta-analysis of four studies and 1389 infected patients (including 273 patients with severe disease), the prevalence of underlying CKD was more frequent among those with severe disease (3.3 versus 0.4 percent; odds ratio 3.03, 95% CI 1.09-8.47) [15].●In the same cohort of 1389 patients from these four studies, history of hypertension was more common among those who had severe, as compared with nonsevere, COVID-19 (15 versus 32 percent) [15]. Similarly, in a separate cohort of 1590 hospitalized patients in China, underlying hypertension was independently associated with severe COVID-19 (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.07-2.32) [14].Renin angiotensin system inhibitors — Patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents (unless there is an indication for discontinuation such as hyperkalemia or hypotension). There is no evidence that stopping ACE inhibitors or ARBs reduces the severity of COVID-19 [16-18]. This approach is supported by multiple guideline panels [19-23].There is speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes [24,25]. ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [26], and renin angiotensin system inhibitors may increase ACE2 levels [27-29]. In addition, patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes (a disorder with a high prevalence of renin angiotensin system inhibitors-treated use) often have a more severe clinical course in the setting of infection with SARS-CoV-2.However, there is no evidence to support an association between renin angiotensin system inhibitor use and more severe disease [16-18], and some data suggest that these drugs may attenuate the severity of disease [30-33]. As an example, in one large retrospective cohort of Chinese adults hospitalized with COVID-19, hypertensive patients taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB had a lower mortality at 28 days compared with those treated with alternative antihypertensive agents (adjusted hazard ratio 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.69) [32].In addition, studies conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that discontinuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs in some patients may exacerbate underlying cardiovascular or kidney disease and lead to increased mortality [34-36].Dialysis access planning in advanced CKD — Patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD who are referred for dialysis access placement should undergo these procedures as planned (and not have their planned procedure deferred). Although nonessential surgeries should be delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from the United States has clarified that placement of arteriovenous fistulas or grafts for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis catheters for peritoneal dialysis are essential procedures.INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES — Infection control practices specific to the care of patients with kidney disease requiring dialysis are presented in the preceding discussions.The general approach to infection control in the health care setting, in the home, and in non-hospital institutional settings, as well as the approach to discontinuation of COVID-19 precautions and return-to-work for health care personnel, are presented in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 due to the older age and high frequency of comorbidity, such as diabetes and hypertension, in this population. (See 'End-stage kidney disease' above.)●The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Society of Nephrology (ASN), and International Society of Nephrology (ISN) have issued interim guidelines and a list of resources to guide nephrology clinicians providing life-sustaining dialysis care. These resources, which continue to evolve and are frequently updated, include guidance about the following: early recognition and isolation of individuals with respiratory symptoms; patient separation and cohorting within waiting areas and within the dialysis unit; use of personal protective equipment in the dialysis unit; and additional measures for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See 'Early recognition/isolation of individuals with respiratory symptoms' above and 'Patient placement' above and 'Personal protective equipment' above and 'Additional measures for COVID-19' above.)●In general, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients receiving dialysis at home (ie, home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) should have their regular follow-up visits performed via telemedicine rather than via in-person, in-clinic visits. In addition, home visits by health care professionals should be minimized or stopped. Patients should have at least two weeks of dialysis supplies and sufficient medications in case they have to self-isolate, or in case there is a break in the supply chain. If an in-person visit is clinically indicated, appropriate infection control procedures for the outpatient unit should be followed, an attempt should be made to limit the number of patients seen per day, and non-essential procedures should be avoided. (See 'Patients receiving home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis' above.)●The American Society of Nephrology has issued guidelines for nephrology clinicians caring for hospitalized patients requiring dialysis for ESKD and acute kidney injury (AKI). These guidelines continue to evolve and are frequently updated.

ID:127762,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines,"INTRODUCTION — The pneumonia associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or nCoV) may lead to respiratory failure with profound hypoxemia requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The rapidly spreading pandemic may result in utilization of all available intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators in individual institutions and regions. Repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term use for days or weeks to ventilate COVID-19 patients or other patients requiring mechanical ventilation has been proposed, but is somewhat unprecedented. Furthermore, anesthesia machines have only been rarely used to administer inhalation anesthetics during prolonged ventilation. This topic will address management of short-term or long-term intensive care ventilation with an anesthesia machine, emphasizing this use for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [1]. Airway management and anesthetic care of patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection for surgical procedures, including preventing infection of anesthesia personnel or contamination of anesthesia machines and equipment are addressed in a separate topic. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)Use of standard ICU ventilators and ventilation of critically ill patients COVID-19 patients are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.)Other details regarding obstetric and critical care of patients with COVID-19 infection, and general medical management are available in additional topics:●(See ""Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumented delivery)"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)PREVENTION OF ANESTHESIA MACHINE CONTAMINATION — Preventing contamination of the external parts of the anesthesia machine, its breathing system and ventilator, and its connection to the gas analyzer and attached monitoring equipment while in use for patients with COVID-19 is described in another topic. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Protection of anesthesia equipment'.)Contamination of an anesthesia machine during use as an intensive care ventilator for patients with known COVID-19 infection is more likely than use during a surgical procedure because of the duration and extent of machine exposure. Based on studies of other coronaviruses, it is estimated that infected patients exhale 0 to 100,000 virus particles per 30 minutes, or as many as 4,800,000 particles per day [2]. However, a single filter with a viral filtration efficiency (VFE) of 99.9999 percent (ie, a good mechanical pleated filter at the expiratory limb) would allow 4.8 of these particles, on average, to pass. If two filters are used such as a heat and moisture exchange filter (HMEF) containing an electrostatic filter placed at the airway plus a mechanical pleated filter placed at the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit, the combined VFE is very high (perhaps as high as 99.99999999 percent), rendering contamination of the anesthesia machine unlikely, even when used for multiple days (with fresh filters each day). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Contamination of the internal components of the anesthesia machine'.)LOCATIONS FOR ANESTHESIA MACHINES — Location(s) selected for use of anesthesia machines to ventilate COVID-19-positive patients will be institution-dependent due to considerations such as layout of selected hospital area(s), location of rooms with negative pressure capabilities, and availability of sources of electrical power, high-pressure oxygen, and medical air [1]. Personnel considerations include availability of anesthesia personnel to manage ventilation with anesthesia machines, and convenience for critical care consultants. When multiple anesthesia machines are used in a single location, the compressed gas pipelines should be assessed to ensure that supply is adequate to meet consumption if supplying an area where multiple anesthesia ventilators are using high fresh gas flows (FGFs). The electrical supply should also be assessed to ensure that circuits will not be overloaded, particularly in areas outside the operating room (OR).Availability of compatible connections from the scavenger system to waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets or medical vacuum outlets is another necessary consideration if inhalation anesthetic agents are to be administered using the anesthesia machine. However, gas scavenging is not necessary if inhalation agents are avoided. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' below and 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below.)Institutional options for location of anesthesia machine ventilators may include intensive care unit (ICU) rooms, the presurgical holding area, post-anesthesia care units (PACUs), or individual ORs [1]. In some institutions, it may be possible to treat two or more COVID-19 patients in the same OR if there are multiple sources of oxygen and medical air, and if anesthesia personnel (ie, clinician anesthesiologists, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists [CRNAs], Certified Anesthesiologist Assistants [CAAs]) are deployed most easily in an OR setting. Notably, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) guidelines for repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation recommend that anesthesia professionals be immediately available at all times to manage and monitor the anesthesia ventilator (and administration of inhalation anesthetic agents, if used), as well as to assist with respiratory care (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator), regardless of the locations(s) for the anesthesia machines [3,4]. (See 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' below and 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' below.) LONG-TERM VENTILATION WITH ANESTHESIA MACHINES — The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidance for anesthesia care team members regarding repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator) [3,4]. These professional societies recommend that anesthesia professionals be immediately available at all times to manage and monitor the anesthesia ventilator. Professional staff who are not anesthesiologists (eg, some intensivists, as well as respiratory therapists, and intensive care unit [ICU] nurses) are experts in respiratory care, but are not familiar with anesthesia machines. Use of anesthesia machine ventilators for patients who require mechanical ventilation for a period of time, but who are not COVID-19-positive, may be a good option for optimal use of institutional resources.Limited data regarding duration of mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 patients suggest that two or more weeks are often necessary. Collaboration with critical care teams throughout this period is clearly essential to achieve optimal respiratory care, and to manage other systemic problems in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.)Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators — Data are limited regarding the capabilities of anesthesia machine ventilators developed by various manufacturers to mimic ICU ventilator parameters or reliably provide continuous mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods of time. Although newer anesthesia ventilators incorporate multiple controlled and assisted modes of ventilation that are nearly identical to ventilators in the ICU, there are several important technical issues that are unique to anesthesia machines, which must be considered during use for long-term ventilation.Adjusting humidifcation of inspired gases●The need to adjust FGF to prevent condensed water accumulation in the breathing circuit. The ability to alter FGF and the fraction of exhaled gas rebreathed is a key feature distinguishing an anesthesia ventilator from an ICU ventilator. FGF is typically reduced during general anesthesia to conserve inhalation anesthetic agent. A FGF that is lower than minute ventilation increases rebreathing of exhaled gas, which is humidified by the body. The reaction of rebreathed carbon dioxide (CO2) with the CO2 absorbent produces additional humidity within the circuit. Experience to date indicates that when an anesthesia machine is in long-term use as an ICU ventilator, reducing FGF leads to excessive humidity in the breathing circuit, and the need to change CO2 absorbent frequently (see ""Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions"", section on 'Carbon dioxide absorbent exhaustion or toxicity'). This additional humidity can be clinically significant leading to water condensation within the breathing circuit that can increase resistance to gas flow through the system, interfere with sensors such as respiratory gas analyzers and flow sensors, and increase risk for coinfections. For these reasons, significant accumulations of water in the breathing circuit (typically expiratory limb) must be emptied. Accumulated water should be emptied carefully and while wearing full PPE, because it may be contaminated with virus. Condensers and water traps may be added to some breathing systems to aid in managing excessive humidity [2].To prevent buildup of humidity and decrease the use of CO2 absorbent, it is recommended that FGF be set to equal minute ventilation initially (approximately 6 to 8 L/minute in adult patients). Generally, it should be apparent in one to two hours if excess moisture is accumulating in the breathing circuit. If it is, FGF can be increased incrementally (eg, by 0.5 to 1 L/min) until humidity is controlled. Alternately, FGF can be set higher (eg, 1.5 times minute ventilation) initially, and can then be reduced in increments of 500 mL/minute with vigilant monitoring for the appearance of humidity in the inspiratory limb. Once FGF exceeds 1.5 times minute ventilation, there is little rebreathing, and increasing FGF further does not provide any advantage and wastes compressed gas (oxygen and medical air).●The need for long-term humidification and warming of inspired gases. Critical care patients should inspire warm humidified gases to prevent drying of secretions and respiratory epithelium. At the low FGFs typically used in the operating room (OR), inspired gas is humidified due to rebreathing [5,6], and also by the release of heat and humidity by the reaction of CO2 with the absorbent [7]. The presence of condensate in the inspiratory hose indicates that the inspired gas is at least partially humidified.However, at the high FGFs that are necessary to manage condensed water accumulation during prolonged ventilation with an anesthesia machine, a heat and moisture exchange filter (HMEF) may be necessary. The HMEF should be placed at the endotracheal tube connection to the breathing circuit (after the Y-piece and the gas sampling port). This HMEF will ensure that adequate humidity is maintained in the lungs and will also filter viral particles. However, an HMEF at the airway is prone to obstruction from moisture or secretions and should be inspected no less frequently than every hour, and changed when obstruction is a concern, or once every 24 hours. Devices that actively humidify inspired gas are not recommended. They cause problems with ventilation and monitoring since anesthesia machines are not designed to handle large amounts of condensed water within their breathing circuit. Unique safety issues●The need to place a second high-quality viral filter (typically a pleated mechanical filter that does not need heat and humidity exchange properties) on the expiratory limb of an anesthesia machine breathing circuit used for ventilation of a COVID-19 patient, even if an HMEF filter is placed at the airway (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Contamination of the internal components of the anesthesia machine'). The filter at the expiratory limb can likely be left in place for a longer period of time than the filter placed at the airway; however, there are no data predicting filter performance over time. Since many institutions have filter shortages, these expiratory limb filters should only be changed as necessary.  ●Potential need to prevent accidental administration of inhalation anesthetic agents. If there are no plans to administer inhalation anesthetics to achieve patient sedation, then the vaporizers for the volatile agents should be removed or drained. Also, the nitrous oxide (N2O) cylinder and pipeline hoses should be removed. These measures ensure that inhalation anesthetic agents are not accidentally administered. However, some institutions with inadequate supplies of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are commonly used in the ICU may consider emergency use of low doses of a volatile inhalation anesthetic agent (isoflurane or sevoflurane), as explained below. (See 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below.)●The potential for the CO2 absorbent to expire. The inspired CO2 and the color indicator of the CO2 absorbent should be monitored frequently. The absorbent should be replaced if inspired CO2 increases (eg, above 5 mmHg) or if the CO2 absorbent color indicates that it has become exhausted. If ventilation must be interrupted to change the absorbent, the patient should be temporarily ventilated by an alternative means. Furthermore, potential reactions with the CO2 absorbent may occur if a volatile anesthetic agent is employed and the absorbent becomes dried by the FGF. (See ""Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions"", section on 'Carbon dioxide absorbent exhaustion or toxicity'.)●Potential need to adjust the scavenger system of the anesthesia machine. If an anesthesia machine is used outside of an OR, it may not be possible to connect its scavenger system to a compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal or vacuum outlet. Waste anesthetic gas disposal outlets are typically only found in operating or procedure rooms, and waste gas hoses from the anesthesia machine may not be compatible with medical vacuum outlets found elsewhere. Waste anesthetic gas scavenging is only necessary when use of inhalation anesthetic agents is planned (see 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below). Importantly, if a scavenger system with a reservoir bag (closed scavenger system) is not connected to vacuum, it can cause high PEEP and peak pressures due to backup of scavenged gas into the breathing system. Options include:•If no inhalation anesthetic agents are to be used (picture 1):-Disconnection of the scavenger system from the hoses coming from the breathing system and ventilator -Removal of the scavenger reservoir bag (if it is a closed scavenger system) •If inhalation anesthetic agent will be used, scavenging is required. Connection of the scavenger system to suction in locations outside the OR (eg, the ICU) may be difficult if the connections are incompatible. In such cases, alternate tubing or connectors, or connection adapters may be used. When higher than usual FGFs are used, scavenger suction must be adjusted upward to ensure proper function. ●The need for periodic performance of an anesthesia machine self-test (ie, power-up test) approximately every 24 to 72 hours. The ASA and anesthesia machine manufacturers recommend a pre-use check every day prior to using the machine in the OR setting. For prolonged use, most manufactures have stated that this can be done approximately every three days. Experience has shown that problems such as inaccurate ventilation delivery and monitoring may occur when anesthesia machines are not restarted and checked at three-day intervals.Notably, an alternative means of ventilation is necessary (eg, with a manual resuscitator or a second ventilator) while the machine is powered down, restarted, and checked. A step-by-step procedure should be followed to ensure that all equipment is available to prevent patient lung de-recruitment, as well as to limit spillage of breathing circuit gas and other contaminants and protect anesthesia personnel during this process (refer to APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and the ASA's Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machines as an ICU Ventilator) [3,4]. A suggested procedure has been developed by the APSF and ASA (refer to the APSF/ASA Procedure for Supporting Patients during the Anesthesia Machine Self-Test) [8].●The need to periodically check the breathing circuit for possible kinking or compression since, unlike ICU ventilators, there is no articulating arm on the anesthesia machine that can hold the breathing circuit up off the bed.●The need to minimize potential for errors in setup of anesthesia machines, initiation of controlled ventilation, and respiratory monitoring in locations outside of the OR suite, ideally by deploying multiple machines of the same model within any one hospital unit (eg, ICU, post-anesthesia care unit [PACU]). Adjusting ventilatory settings●The need to understand how specific capabilities differ among individual anesthesia machines:•Newer anesthesia machines have ventilator capabilities similar to modern ICU ventilators, with more flexible settings that can deliver more modes of ventilation (including assist modes) compared with older models. Newer models with compliance compensation and tidal volume delivery unaffected by changes in fresh gas flow (FGF) are generally preferred (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators). •Newer machines are also equipped with breathing systems and ventilators that can be sterilized between patients, and are better choices for those with COVID-19 infection.•Older models can be reserved for surgical patients and for ventilation of patients without COVID-19 respiratory disease, if feasible.●The need to understand how settings and performance of anesthesia machine ventilators differ from those of ICU ventilators when making adjustments in ventilator settings:•Anesthesia machines do not default to pressure support of extra breaths in control modes. Care must be taken to add this when changing ventilator modes.•Anesthesia machines may have a lower peak inspiratory flow rate. Negative airway pressure occurs if the patient inhales faster than the maximum inspiratory flow rate provided by the ventilator.•Anesthesia machines are milliseconds slower to respond to patient effort because of the circle breathing system interposed between the patient and anesthesia ventilator [9], which can cause more hyperventilation in an air-hungry patient.•Inspiratory time is not directly set on an anesthesia machine. Most anesthesia machines do not provide direct control of inspiratory time; instead this is controlled indirectly by setting the I:E ratio and the respiratory rate.Options for setting the anesthesia machine ventilator include:-In volume control modes (including synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation [SIMV]), the inspiratory flow rate can be increased by increasing tidal volume or by decreasing inspiratory time (accomplished by reducing the I:E ratio or by increasing the respiratory rate). -In pressure control or support modes, the inspiratory flow rate can be increased by lowering the flow trigger level for ventilation (which increases the speed at which pressure-support is provided), or by decreasing the rise time of pressure support (which increases the inspiratory flow rate). On Draeger anesthesia machine ventilators, the flow trigger level is called ""Trigger L/min"" and the rise time is called ""Tslope."" On GE Healthcare Systems anesthesia machine ventilators, the flow trigger level is called ""Flow Trigger"" and the rise time is called ""Rise Rate."" However, lowering the flow trigger level may cause extra mis-triggered breaths in some patients; if these occur, the flow trigger level must be increased. On some Draeger machine ventilators, the maximum inspiratory flow is governed by a facility-level setting, although on-site clinical engineers can adjust this parameter to allow a maximum inspiratory flow of 75 L/min.●Potential need to modify default ventilator parameters and alarm settings. Default settings on the anesthesia machine, such as minute ventilation, airway pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels, and alarms, may be modified to better match those of an ICU ventilator. The default alarm volumes should be set to maximum.●The potential for the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration in the breathing circuit to be lower than the set oxygen gas concentration on the anesthesia machine (FgO2). Because of the rebreathing that occurs in an anesthesia machine circle breathing circuit, inspired oxygen concentration depends on both the ratio of oxygen to air in the delivered fresh gas (determined by the FGF setting) and the total FGF (which influences the amount of rebreathing). Thus, inspired oxygen concentration must be continuously monitored (see 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' below). Notably, when total FGF is very high (eg, >12 L/minute), a FiO2 of 100 percent cannot be delivered if the total FGF is higher than the maximum possible flow of oxygen. In some older hospitals, anesthesia machines deployed to non-ICU locations outside the OR may not be able to draw their theoretical maximum total FGF.●Potential need to modify oxygen utilization by the anesthesia machine ventilator if oxygen supply is limited by factors such as [1]:•Delay in delivery of liquid oxygen to the hospital•Excessive use of oxygen by the hospital, such that the oxygen vaporizers (where liquid oxygen is converted to gas oxygen) become covered in ice, resulting in inefficiency •Inability of the flow in an oxygen pipeline branch to keep up with demand due to the number of ventilators, anesthesia machines, and oxygen flowmeters on that branch in certain hospital locations.The ability of anesthesia machines to draw less oxygen than the patient's minute ventilation can be a substantial advantage in such situations, particularly those machines with electrically powered piston or turbine ventilators that do not consume oxygen. Anesthesia machines with bellows ventilators typically use oxygen as the drive gas that compresses the bellows; these consume oxygen at a rate approximating minute ventilation (in addition to using oxygen in the FGF). However, anesthesia machines with bellows ventilators may be modified by a qualified clinical engineer to be powered by compressed air instead of oxygen [10], a modification made when the machine is not in use (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators). Monitoring long-term ventilation — An anesthesia professional should be available to start ventilation and subsequently monitor degree of moisture accumulation, inspired and expired CO2, filter integrity, overall anesthesia machine function, and effectiveness of ventilation [1]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.) The APSF/ASA guidelines address additional maintenance and monitoring requirements during use of anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation of COVID-19 patients (refer to APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions - Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator) [3,4]. These additional considerations are necessary due to use of extra filters which may become clogged, the tendency to accumulate condensed water in the breathing circuit, and risks for aerosolizing droplets containing COVID-19 virus.Documentation of this enhanced monitoring of continuous and intermittent parameters is necessary. This may be achieved automatically if the anesthesia machine connected to the hospital network for recording to the electronic medical record [1], or manually using a template developed for this purpose by the anesthesia team.Patient monitoring — Baseline monitored parameters (eg, tidal volume, plateau pressure (Pplat), minute ventilation) should be recorded when ventilation is initiated. If spirometry is available, saving or photographing the baseline tracings and reference loops may aid in later diagnosis of filter obstructions.Continuously monitored parameters (with preset alarms) that are checked and recorded each hour include:●Inspired oxygen concentration. ●Inspired and expired CO2.●Inspiratory pressure.●Tidal volume and respiratory rate. ●Low oxygen pressure alarm. If an anesthesia machines with an oxygen-driven bellows is being used, a low oxygen pressure alarm triggered by each inspiration may indicate a high demand on the institutional central oxygen pipeline system, particularly when multiple ventilators are simultaneously in use. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)Intermittently monitored ventilatory and physiologic parameters include:●Check Pplat at least once every four hours, and after each change in PEEP or tidal volume, to ensure that it is ≤30 cm H2O. Measurement of Pplat is accomplished during a 0.5 second inspiratory pause. Unlike many ICU ventilators, anesthesia machines do not have a control to manually initiate an inspiratory pause. On an anesthesia machine ventilator, a 0.5 second inspiratory pause can be generated by temporarily setting the mode to volume ventilation with the tidal volume that the patient has been receiving, at 10 breaths per minute, with an I:E ratio of 1:2 and a 50 percent inspiratory pause (Tpause or TIP). (See ""Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults"", section on 'Plateau pressure'.)●Check the flow readings approximately every four hours, since these may become less accurate over time. If the machine is equipped with both inspiratory and expiratory flow sensors, a gradual increase in the difference between inspired and exhaled tidal volume measurements usually indicates that a startup test is needed to recalibrate the breathing system flow sensors.●Confirm there is no leak around the endotracheal tube cuff every hour because such a leak produces respiratory droplets and aerosolized viral particles. A leak around the endotracheal tube cuff typically manifests as measured exhaled tidal volume that is lower than measured inhaled tidal volume, and a flow-volume loop that does not close [11]. At low FGFs a bellows ventilator may progressively empty, while the reservoir bag will progressively deflate in machines with a piston or turbine ventilator. High FGF compensates for small leaks, obscuring these indicators of breathing circuit volume.Machine maintenance and monitoring — Intermittent inspection and maintenance of proper anesthesia machine and breathing circuit function including:●Inspect the breathing circuit hoses and water trap for excessive condensed water every hour. If fluid has accumulated in the breathing circuit and is threatening to impede ventilation, it must be emptied. Plans should be in place to ventilate the patient while the circuit is emptied. Further, proper collection and disposal procedures for contaminated water and personal protective equipment (PPE) for personnel performing this procedure are necessary when handling fluids potentially contaminated with virus.High peak airway pressure during volume ventilation or low tidal volume during pressure ventilation are signs of profound obstruction of the filters placed at the airway or in the expiratory limb. Decreased peak expiratory flow and prolongation of expiratory flow are earlier indications of partial obstruction of one of these filters [11]. Significant obstruction of either filter also creates additional PEEP, with a difference between the set and actual PEEP that can be seen in the airway pressure when the expiratory limb filter is obstructed. Notably, this additional PEEP is invisible when the airway filter is obstructed since airway pressure is measured downstream of that filter. ●Inspect the breathing circuit hoses for possible kinking or compression every hour as well.●Inspect the airway and expiratory limb breathing circuit filters every hour to check for excessive humidity or secretions that may cause obstruction of gas flow. The airway filter is at highest risk. Obstructed filters must be changed. Otherwise, filters are typically replaced every 24 hours. ●Check the CO2 absorbent color and inspired CO2 values every hour to ensure that the absorbent is still functioning properly and does not need to be exchanged. This is especially important if lower FGFs are being used.●Confirm that an anesthesia machine startup test was performed once every 24 to 72 hours (refer to the APSF/ASA Procedure for Supporting Patients during the Anesthesia Machine Self-Test) [8]. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)USE OF INHALATION ANESTHETICS FOR SEDATION — Institutions with shortages of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation may consider using low doses of a potent volatile inhalation anesthetic agent (isoflurane or sevoflurane). The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidelines for such emergency use (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [12]. However, administration of inhalation anesthetic agents for prolonged periods in critically ill patients is not encouraged, as scant safety data exist for this use and there are some disadvantages, as noted below. (See 'Advantages and disadvantages' below.)Intravenous sedative-analgesic regimens that are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation are discussed in separate topics:●(See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal"".)●(See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects"".)●(See ""Pain control in the critically ill adult patient"".)Dosing to achieve sedation — Administration of low doses of either sevoflurane (eg, 0.5 to 1.4 percent) or isoflurane (eg, 0.2 to 0.7 percent) for long-term sedation is reasonable if use of a volatile inhalation anesthetic agent becomes necessary.Factors influencing dosing include whether the targeted level of sedation is achieved with satisfactory patient comfort. The presence of ventilator dyssynchrony may necessitate deepening the anesthetic/sedation level. Conversely, if hypotension is present, lightening of the anesthetic/sedation level is necessary. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Clinical effects'.)When the decision is made to allow the patient to awaken, the anesthetic vaporizer is turned off, and fresh gas flow (FGF) is increased. Washout of anesthetic agent is rapid and predictable, with patients typically able to respond to commands and be assessed for extubation within 10 to 15 minutes. (See ""Emergence from general anesthesia"", section on 'Inhalation agents'.)Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics — In addition to the suggested monitoring noted above for use of anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation (see 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above), specialized monitoring requiring the constant presence of an anesthesia provider is necessary during administration of inhalation anesthetic agents.Patient monitoring during sedation●Continuously monitored parameters include:•End-tidal anesthetic concentration, with titration of anesthetic dosing to the minimal effective end-tidal concentration. The low-level and high-level alarms on the anesthetic gas monitor should be enabled.•Exhaled end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) to monitor for the possibility of malignant hyperthermia (which severely and acutely increases ETCO2), and to help manage ventilation. (See 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above.)•Temperature, since potent inhalation anesthetics lower core temperatures (see ""Perioperative temperature management"", section on 'Anesthetic effects on thermoregulation'), and to monitor for the possibility of malignant hyperthermia (which acutely increases temperature to >102°F [38.9°C).●Other monitored parameters include:•Hemodynamic monitoring per usual standards for care of individual critically ill patients, and may be useful to evaluate cardiovascular responses to an inhalation anesthetic agent. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Hemodynamic monitoring' and ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Cardiovascular effects'.)•Serum creatinine and liver function tests are obtained at intervals that may be daily (in consultation with the critical care team), as a check for renal or hepatic dysfunction during long-term administration of a volatile anesthetic agent.Equipment monitoring during sedation — Intermittent inspection and maintenance of anesthetic administration includes:●The fill level of anesthetic vaporizers is checked every hour since rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents occurs due to high FGF; refill when anesthetic level <20 percent full.Liquid anesthetic use can be estimated. One mL of a liquid volatile anesthetic agent yields approximately 200 mL of gas anesthetic (specific values are 195 mL for isoflurane or 184 mL for sevoflurane). Thus, at 10 L/min of FGF, the liquid volatile anesthetic consumption is approximately 30 mL/hour if a 1 percent inhaled concentration is delivered. Most vaporizers hold approximately 200 ml of liquid, so refills would be needed multiple times each day even at the lower doses noted above for use of isoflurane or sevoflurane for patient sedation during mechanical ventilation. (See 'Dosing to achieve sedation' above.)One way to reduce consumption of volatile anesthetic agent is to reduce FGF. Another way to agent consumption is to use an anesthetic reflector device such as the AnaConDa or Mirus [13-18]. These devices are designed for administration of inhalation anesthetic agents using a traditional intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator, but are not approved for use in the United States. The device is placed between the Y-piece and patient, where it vaporizes small amounts of anesthetic liquid, and absorbs most of the exhaled anesthetic, which is then re-inhaled on the next breath (much like a heat and moisture exchanger [HME] absorbs and conserves humidity). Notably, room contamination still occurs with use of these devices unless a scavenging system is employed [16-18]. ●Proper functioning of the scavenging system is confirmed when administration of inhalation anesthetics is initiated, then every 24 hours or after major changes in the rate of FGF. Anesthetic vapor is consumed rapidly and the scavenger system requires high vacuum flow when high FGF is used. Advantages and disadvantages — Advantages and disadvantages of specific agents (sevoflurane versus isoflurane) are discussed separately. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Sevoflurane' and ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Isoflurane'.)Potential advantages and disadvantages for long-term use of sevoflurane or isoflurane for sedation of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 induced respiratory failure include:●Advantages•Effective sedative effects, with rapid onset and offset allowing easy titratability. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Sedation and anesthesia'.)•Minimal metabolism and likely minimal organ toxicity. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Properties and delivery"", section on 'Metabolism'.)•Readily available.•Potentially advantageous respiratory effects-Bronchodilation, with attenuation of bronchospasm and decreased airway responsiveness. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Respiratory effects'.)-Pulmonary anti-inflammatory effects observed during short-term anesthetic administration for surgical procedures. This may minimize the extent of lung injury by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release [19-22]. (See ""One lung ventilation: General principles"", section on 'Intravenous versus inhalation anesthetics'.)•Dose-dependent muscle relaxation during mechanical ventilation. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Skeletal and smooth muscle relaxation'.)●Disadvantages•Scant safety data regarding use of inhalation anesthetic agents for prolonged periods in critically ill patients. However, long-term sedation with sevoflurane or isoflurane has been employed in some nations for sedation of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other critical illness, without evidence of renal or hepatic injury [22-26].•Rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents occurs due to high FGF. Thus, hourly inspection of the anesthetic vaporizer fill level and analysis of end-tidal anesthetic concentration are particularly important. (See 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' above.)•Potential for inadequate sedation, particularly if the patient has received a neuromuscular blocking agent. Thus, the patient and anesthesia machine and anesthetic vaporizer must be carefully monitored. •Potential difficulty with connection of the anesthesia machine scavenger systems to compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets in settings outside an operating room (OR). (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)•Lack of familiarity among non-anesthesia personnel caring for critically ill patients with ARDS (eg, intensivists, nurses, respiratory therapists) regarding use of anesthesia machines to administer volatile inhalation anesthetic agents, dosing of these agents, and potential pitfalls that may occur during their administration (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [12]. •Need for constant presence of anesthesia personnel as recommended by the ASA and APSF (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [12].  •Potentially undesirable systemic effects of a potent volatile anesthetic agent in critically ill patients, including:-Cardiovascular effects (eg, myocardial depression and vasodilatory properties that result in dose-dependent reductions in blood pressure and cardiac output). (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Cardiovascular effects'.)-Adverse respiratory effects including airway irritation, particularly with the more pungent agents such as isoflurane, as well as respiratory depression. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Respiratory effects'.)-Cerebral effects (eg, dose-dependent cerebral vasodilation, with blunting of cerebral autoregulation by uncoupling cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism, thereby increasing CBF and intracranial pressure (ICP). Thus, patients with known or suspected elevations in ICP are not candidates for sedation with inhalation anesthetic agents. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Effects on cerebral physiology'.)•Although rare, potential for potent inhalation anesthetic agents to cause malignant hyperthermia. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Malignant hyperthermia (volatile inhalation agents)'.)COLLABORATION WITH CRITICAL CARE CONSULTANTS — Collaboration and coordination with critical care clinicians is essential for care of COVID-19 patients regarding decisions for long-term ventilation of these patients using an anesthesia ventilator, and for management of comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular and renal complications, coinfection with sepsis) [27-31]. These issues are discussed in detail in separate topics:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Contamination of an anesthesia machine, its breathing system and ventilator, and its connection to the gas analyzer is more likely during use as an intensive care ventilator compared with use during surgical procedures for patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or nCoV) infection because of the duration and extent of machine exposure. However, if two filters are used (eg, a heat and moisture exchange filter [HMEF] containing an electrostatic filter placed at the airway plus a mechanical pleated filter placed at the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit), the combined viral filtration efficiency (VFE) is very high, rendering contamination of the anesthesia machine unlikely, even when used for multiple days (with fresh filters each day). (See 'Prevention of anesthesia machine contamination' above.)●Locations selected for use of anesthesia machines to ventilate COVID-19 patients will be institution-dependent depending on layout of selected hospital area(s), location of rooms with negative pressure capabilities, availability of sources of high-pressure oxygen and medical air, availability of compatible connections from the scavenger system to waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets when inhalation anesthetic agents are used, and availability of anesthesia personnel to manage the anesthesia machines. (See 'Locations for anesthesia machines' above.)●The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidance for repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator). Although newer anesthesia ventilators incorporate multiple controlled and assisted modes of ventilation that are nearly identical to ventilators in the intensive care unit (ICU), several important technical issues are unique to anesthesia machines during such use (see 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above):•The age and specific capabilities of individual anesthesia machines (newer anesthesia machines have more flexible capabilities and can deliver more modes of ventilation).•The need to adjust fresh gas flow (FGF) to prevent condensed water accumulation in the breathing circuit.•The need for long-term humification and warming of inspired gases.•The need for two high-quality viral filters (one at the airway and on the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit).•The need to understand how settings and performance of anesthesia machine ventilators can be different from those of ICU ventilators.•Potential need to modify default ventilator parameters and alarm settings.•The potential for the carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbent to expire.•The potential for the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration in the breathing circuit to be lower than the set oxygen gas concentration on the anesthesia machine (FgO2).•The need to prevent accidental administration of inhalation anesthetic agents, if inhalation anesthetics are not administered to achieve patient sedation.•Potential need to adjust the scavenger system to prevent backpressure in the breathing system if the anesthesia machine is used outside of an operating room (OR).•The need for periodic performance of an anesthesia machine self-test (ie, power-up test) approximately every 24 to 72 hours.•The need to periodically check the breathing circuit for possible kinking or compression.•The need to minimize potential for errors in setup of anesthesia machines, initiation of controlled ventilation, and respiratory monitoring in locations outside the OR, ideally by deploying multiple machines of the same model within any one hospital unit.●An anesthesia professional should be available to start and monitor ventilation and overall anesthesia machine function (see 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above):•Continuously or intermittently monitored patient parameters (with preset alarms) that are checked and recorded each hour include (see 'Patient monitoring' above):-Inspired oxygen concentration -Inspired and expired CO2-Inspiratory pressure-Tidal volume and respiratory rate-Low oxygen pressure alarm-Check Pplat at least once every four hours, and after each change in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or tidal volume-Check the flow readings approximately every four hours -Confirm there is no leak around the endotracheal tube cuff every hour •Intermittently machine monitoring includes inspection of (see 'Machine maintenance and monitoring' above):-Breathing circuit hoses and water trap for excessive condensed water every hour.-Breathing circuit hoses for possible kinking or compression every hour-Airway and expiratory limb breathing circuit filters every hour for excessive humidity or secretions-CO2 absorbent color and inspired CO2 values every hour -Documentation of anesthesia machine startup test performance once every 24 to 72 hours ●Although intravenous sedative-analgesic regimens are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation, institutions with shortages of these intravenous agents may consider using low doses of a potent volatile inhalation anesthetic agent for long-term sedation (ie, sevoflurane [0.5 to 1.4%] or isoflurane [0.2 to 0.7%]; refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients). (See 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' above and 'Dosing to achieve sedation' above.)●Advantages and disadvantages of use of inhalation anesthetic agents in this setting include (see 'Advantages and disadvantages' above):•Advantages -Effective sedative effects, with rapid onset and offset allowing easy titratability-Minimal metabolism and likely minimal organ toxicity-Readily available-Advantageous respiratory effects including bronchodilation and possible pulmonary anti-inflammatory effects -Dose-dependent muscle relaxation•Disadvantages -Scant safety data regarding use of inhalation anesthetic agents for prolonged periods-Lack of familiarity among non-anesthesia personnel caring for critically ill patients -Need for constant presence of anesthesia personnel -Rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents due to high FGF-Potential for inadequate sedation-Potential difficulty with connection of the anesthesia machine scavenger systems to compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets-Potentially undesirable cardiovascular, respiratory, or cerebral effects of potent volatile anesthetic agents in critically ill patients-Although rare, potential for malignant hyperthermia ●Specialized additional monitoring is necessary if inhalation anesthetics are administered for long-term sedation, requiring the constant presence of an anesthesia provider and specialized monitoring that includes (see 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' above):•Patient parameters (see 'Patient monitoring during sedation' above):-End-tidal anesthetic concentration, with titration of anesthetic dosing-Exhaled end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2)-Temperature-Hemodynamic monitoring per usual standards for an individual critically ill patient-Serum creatinine and liver function tests at appropriate intervals•Equipment monitoring (see 'Equipment monitoring during sedation' above):-The fill level of anesthetic vaporizers is checked every hour -Proper functioning of the scavenging system is confirmed initially, then every 24 hours or after major changes in FGF rate",2020-04-30 02:00:00,UPTODATE
ID:127926,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability,"INTRODUCTION — A novel coronavirus was identified in late 2019 that rapidly reached pandemic proportions. The World Health Organization has designated the disease caused by the virus (SARS-CoV-2) as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Individuals with COVID-19 may have a number of coagulation abnormalities (in the direction of an underlying hypercoagulable state), raising questions about appropriate evaluations and interventions to prevent or treat thrombosis. Interim guidance has been published by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and frequently asked questions are posted on the websites of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC).This topic reviews evaluation and management of coagulation abnormalities in individuals with COVID-19.Separate topics discuss the following:●General management – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●Critical care – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)●Pregnancy – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●Anesthesia – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is incompletely understood.Virchow's triad — Hypercoagulability can be thought of in terms of Virchow's triad (see ""Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis"", section on 'Virchow's triad'). All three of the major contributions to clot formation apply to severe COVID-19 infection:●Endothelial injury – There is evidence of direct invasion of endothelial cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, potentially leading to cell injury. Other sources of endothelial injury include intravascular catheters and mediators of the acute systemic inflammatory response such as cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-6) and other acute phase reactants [1]. The contribution of complement-mediated endothelial injury has been suggested but not confirmed. (See ""The endothelium: A primer"" and ""Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention"" and ""Acute phase reactants"".)●Stasis – Immobilization can cause stasis of blood flow in all hospitalized and critically ill patients, regardless of whether they have COVID-19.●Hypercoagulable state – A number of changes in circulating prothrombotic factors have been reported or proposed in patients with severe COVID-19 [2,3]:•Elevated factor VIII •Elevated fibrinogen•Circulating prothrombotic microparticles•Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)Very elevated levels of D-dimer have been observed that correlate with illness severity; D-dimer is a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin indicating augmented thrombin generation and fibrin dissolution by plasmin. However, high D-dimer levels are common in acutely ill individuals with a number of infectious and inflammatory diseases. Likewise, antiphospholipid antibodies, which can prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), are common in viral infections, but they are often transient and do not always imply an increased risk of thrombosis. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' below and 'Clinical features' below.) Coagulation abnormalities — The predominant coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 suggest a hypercoagulable state and are consistent with uncontrolled clinical observations of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (see 'VTE' below). This state has been termed thromboinflammation or COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) by some experts [4,5]. It appears to be distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), though DIC has been reported in severely affected patients.Laboratory findings were characterized in a series of 24 selected patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (intubated) who were evaluated along with standard coagulation testing and other assays including von Willebrand factor (VWF) and thromboelastography (TEG) [2]:●Coagulation testing•Prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT normal or slightly prolonged•Platelet counts normal or increased (mean, 348,000/microL)•Fibrinogen increased (mean, 680 mg/dL; range 234 to 1344)●Other assays•Factor VIII activity increased (mean, 297 units/dL)•VWF antigen greatly increased (mean, 529; range 210 to 863), consistent with endothelial injury or perturbation•Minor changes in natural anticoagulants-Small decreases in antithrombin and free protein S-Small increase in protein C ●TEG findings•Reaction time (R) shortened, consistent with increased early thrombin burst, in 50 percent of patients•Clot formation time (K) shortened, consistent with increased fibrin generation, in 83 percent•Maximum amplitude (MA) increased, consistent with greater clot strength, in 83 percent•Clot lysis at 30 minutes (LY30) reduced, consistent with reduced fibrinolysis, in 100 percentTesting in this study was performed on arterial blood because the patients had arterial catheters in place, but venous blood can be used. Heparinase was included since most patients were receiving low molecular weight (LMW) heparin. Other studies have reported similar findings consistent with a hypercoagulable state, including very high D-dimers, VWF antigen and activity, and factor VIII activity [3,6]. One study suggested that patients with COVID-19 have higher platelet counts than patients with other coronavirus infections [7]. One found a high rate of lupus anticoagulant (50 of 57 tested individuals [88 percent]) [6]. Early case series, including a series of 183 consecutive patients from Wuhan, China, suggested that thrombocytopenia and prolongation of the PT and aPTT were more marked [8-11]. It is not clear why these results differed somewhat from later findings of less severe PT and aPTT prolongation. One possible explanation is that these patients were sicker, perhaps because earlier in the pandemic the disease was not recognized as quickly, resulting in delays in patient presentation and/or treatment.Some of the markers of deranged coagulation (eg, D-dimer) appear to correlate with illness severity. D-dimer is often increased, sometimes markedly, in individuals with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and those in the intensive care unit (ICU). Principles of TEG and interpretation of TEG tracings are illustrated in the figure (figure 1) and discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Platelet function testing"", section on 'Thromboelastography (TEG) and ROTEM' and ""Acute coagulopathy associated with trauma"", section on 'Thromboelastography'.)Distinction from DIC — The hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 has been referred to by some as a DIC-like state, especially because many affected individuals are acutely ill and meet criteria for probable DIC in a scoring system published by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) in 2009 [12]. However, the major clinical finding in COVID-19 is thrombosis, whereas the major finding in acute decompensated DIC is bleeding.Likewise, COVID-19 has some similar laboratory findings to DIC, including a marked increase in D-dimer and in some cases mild thrombocytopenia. However, other coagulation parameters in COVID-19 are distinct from DIC. In COVID-19, the typical findings include high fibrinogen and high factor VIII activity, suggesting that major consumption of coagulation factors is not occurring [2]. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above.)In contrast, acute decompensated DIC is associated with low fibrinogen due to consumption of clotting factors. In one of the largest series that reported on thromboembolic events, none of the patients developed overt DIC [13].Typically, bleeding predominates in acute decompensated DIC and thrombosis predominates in chronic compensated DIC, although there is significant overlap. Thus, the hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 is most similar to compensated DIC. (See ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Pathogenesis'.)This ISTH scoring system is based on laboratory findings and is only intended for use in patients with an underlying condition known to be associated with DIC [12]. COVID-19 would qualify based on being a severe infection. Points are given for thrombocytopenia (1 point for platelet count 50,000 to 100,000/microL; 2 points for <50,000/microL), prolonged PT (1 point for 3 to 6 seconds of prolongation; 2 points for more than 6 seconds), low fibrinogen (1 point for <100 mg/dL), and increased D-dimer (2 points for moderate increase; 3 points for ""strong"" increase). A score of 5 or more points suggests DIC is probable. Despite this, the diagnosis of DIC is made clinically; there is no gold standard and no single test or combination of tests that is pathognomonic. Compared with expert opinion, the ISTH scoring system is reported to have a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 97 percent [12]. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above.)Regardless of whether the differences from DIC or the similarities are emphasized, many of the basic principles of DIC management apply, including the importance of treating the underlying condition, the importance of basing interventions on the clinical picture rather than on laboratory testing alone, and the need to provide anticoagulation for thrombosis and appropriate hemostatic therapies for bleeding. (See ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Treatment'.)CLINICAL FEATURESVTE — Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is very common in acutely ill patients with COVID-19, seen in up to one-third of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), even when prophylactic anticoagulation is used. ICU — Case series of ICU patients have reported high rates of VTE (range, 20 to 43 percent), mostly pulmonary embolism (PE), and often despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation:●A series of 184 sequential patients with severe COVID-19 in the ICU reported PE in 25 (14 percent); deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 1; and catheter-associated thrombosis in 2 [13]. The cumulative incidence of VTE (based on different durations of follow-up) was calculated at 27 percent. All were receiving at least standard dose thromboprophylaxis. The group as a whole was very ill, with 13 percent requiring renal replacement therapy and 13 percent mortality. Three-fourths of the patients were male, and several had active cancer (independent VTE risk factors). ●A series of 150 ICU patients reported VTE in 64 (43 percent, mostly PE) and clotting of the extracorporeal circuit in 28 of 29 receiving continuous renal replacement therapy and 2 of 12 undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [6]. All patients were receiving thromboprophylaxis (mostly low molecular weight [LMW] heparin), 70 percent with prophylactic dose and 30 percent therapeutic dose. This study also compared the subgroup of 77 patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to a matched cohort of 145 patients with non-COVID-19-ARDS and found the rate of thrombotic complications (mostly PE) to be higher in the COVID-19 patients (12 versus 2 percent).●A series of 107 ICU patients reported PE in 22 (21 percent; cumulative incidence at 15 days, 20 percent) [14]. Of the 22 patients with PE, 20 were receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 2 were receiving therapeutic dose anticoagulation (for prior VTE and atrial fibrillation). By comparison, the incidence of PE in two matched cohorts (one from the same time interval in the previous year and one from concurrent patients with influenza rather than COVID-19) were 6 and 8 percent, respectively.●A series that included 74 ICU patients reported VTE in 29 (39 percent), with a cumulative incidence of 25 percent at 7 days and 48 percent at 14 days [15]. All of these individuals were receiving anticoagulation, most at prophylactic levels. None of the patients receiving therapeutic level anticoagulation at admission developed VTE.●An earlier series of 81 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia reported VTE in 20 (25 percent) [16].●A study that performed screening leg ultrasounds in 26 individuals with COVID-19 in the ICU who were all receiving either prophylactic dose or therapeutic dose anticoagulation found VTE in 18 (69 percent), including bilateral clots in 10 (38 percent) [17]. Some of these individuals had additional VTE risk factors including cancer, recent surgery, high body mass index (BMI), or prior VTE; 7 (27 percent) were receiving anticoagulation prior to admission.VTE risk is in the range where some experts would suggest more aggressive thromboprophylactic dosing of anticoagulants or even empiric therapeutic dose anticoagulation for VTE prevention. Some of these studies noted a higher than average body mass index in affected individuals, suggesting that obesity, along with other risk factors, may warrant consideration in decision-making regarding the intensity of anticoagulation. (See 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below.)Inpatients (non-ICU) — Data are more limited regarding the rate of VTE in inpatients who are not in the ICU. The series with a 39 percent rate of VTE in ICU patients above also included 124 non-ICU patients, and of those, only 4 (3 percent) were diagnosed with VTE [15].Outpatients — We are aware that thrombotic events have been observed in COVID-19 patients who were not admitted to the hospital, but data on the incidence are not available. Arterial events — There are also reports of arterial thrombosis, including in the central nervous system. As examples:●A single health system identified five cases of acute ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19 over a two-week period, with symptoms suggesting large-vessel occlusion; all patients were under 50 years of age [18]. In other time periods before the pandemic, there were approximately 0.7 large vessel strokes per two-week interval in individuals under age 50. ●In one of the series of ICU patients discussed above, ischemic stroke was observed in 3 of 184 (cumulative incidence, 3.7 percent) [13].●In another one of the series discussed above, cerebral ischemia was seen in 3 of 150 [6].Myocardial infarction and peripheral arterial thromboembolism have been reported but have not been emphasized in available series.Microvascular thrombosis — Autopsy studies in some individuals who have died from COVID-19 have demonstrated microvascular thrombosis in the lungs [5,19]. The mechanism is unclear and may involve hypercoagulability, direct endothelial injury, complement activation, or other processes. In the absence of more definitive data regarding mechanisms or therapy, we would not pursue specialized testing for thrombotic microangiopathies (eg, ADAMTS13 activity, complement studies) or specialized therapies (eg, plasma exchange, anti-complement therapy) outside of a research study.Bleeding — Bleeding is less common than clotting in patients with COVID-19, but it may occur, especially in the setting of anticoagulation. As an example, in a subset of 25 ICU patients who were evaluated for abnormal neurologic findings, one had evidence of intracranial hemorrhage as well as ischemic lesions [6]. Three other patients in this series also had hemorrhagic complications, including two intracerebral bleeds associated with head trauma and one with hemorrhagic complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Three others in this series had evidence of intracerebral ischemia. (See 'Arterial events' above.)EVALUATION — The evaluation of patients with COVID-19 and coagulation abnormalities (suspected or documented) can be challenging due to the limited data on which clinical parameters or coagulation abnormalities should be acted upon and the concerns related to performing diagnostic imaging procedures on acutely ill and potentially contagious patients. A general approach is as follows, although other decisions may be made by the treating clinicians based on their evaluation of the patient. This approach is consistent with guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the American Society of Hematology (ASH), and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) [4,20,21]. Routine testing (all patients)●Inpatients – We assess the following in inpatients with COVID-19:•Complete blood count (CBC) including platelet count•Coagulation studies (prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT])•Fibrinogen•D-dimerRepeat testing is reasonable on a daily basis or less frequently, depending on the acuity of the patient's illness, the initial result, and the trend in values. Measurement of the D-dimer more than once per day is generally not indicated.As noted above, common laboratory findings include (see 'Coagulation abnormalities' above):•High D-dimer •High fibrinogen•Normal or mildly prolonged PT and aPTT•Mild thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, or normal platelet countWe do not intervene for these abnormal coagulation studies in the absence of clinical indications. However, these findings may have prognostic value and may impact decision-making about the level of care and/or investigational therapies directed at treating the infection. As an example, increasing D-dimer is associated with poor prognosis. (See 'Investigational therapies' below.)Atypical findings such as a markedly prolonged aPTT (out of proportion to the PT), low fibrinogen, or severe thrombocytopenia suggest that another condition may be present and additional evaluation may be indicated. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)We do not routinely test for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), other thrombotic microangiopathies, or antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). There are no therapeutic implications of transiently positive aPL in the absence of clinical findings. Transient aPL positivity is often seen in acute infections. (See ""Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome"", section on 'Other conditions associated with aPL'.)We do not routinely perform imaging for screening purposes, as there is no evidence that indicates this practice improves outcomes, and it may unnecessarily expose health care workers to additional infectious risks. However, imaging is appropriate in individuals with symptoms, as discussed below. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)●Outpatients – For outpatients, routine coagulation testing is not required. Evaluation of abnormal symptoms or findings on examination is similar to inpatients. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)Role of additional testingDiagnosis of DVT or PE — Evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) may be challenging, because symptoms of PE overlap with COVID-19, and imaging studies may not be feasible in all cases. The threshold for evaluation or diagnosis of DVT or PE should be low given the high frequency of these events and the presence of additional venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factors in many individuals. (See 'VTE' above.) ●DVT – Individuals with suspected DVT should have compression ultrasonography when feasible according to standard indications. (See ""Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity"".)●PE – We agree with guidance from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) regarding diagnosis of PE, which includes the following [22]:•A normal D-dimer is sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of PE. An increase in D-dimer is not specific for VTE and is not sufficient to make the diagnosis.•In patients with suspected PE due to unexplained hypotension, tachycardia, worsening respiratory status, or other risk factors for thrombosis, computed tomography with pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred test to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is an alternative if CTPA cannot be performed or is inconclusive, although V/Q scan may be unhelpful in individuals with significant pulmonary involvement from COVID-19. Consultation with the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) in decision-making is advised if possible. (See ""Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism"".)The role of full-dose anticoagulation if CTPA or V/Q scan is not feasible is discussed below. (See 'Documented or presumed VTE' below.)Infection control procedures should be followed in patients undergoing imaging studies. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Evaluation of atypical laboratory findings — As noted above, typical laboratory findings of COVID-19 are monitored for their prognostic value. (See 'Routine testing (all patients)' above.)Laboratory findings that are atypical for COVID-19, such as severe thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count <50,000/microL), a prolonged aPTT out of proportion to the PT, or a markedly reduced fibrinogen, should be evaluated as done for individuals without COVID-19, as discussed in separate topic reviews:●Thrombocytopenia – (See ""Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia"".)●Abnormal coagulation tests – (See ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Evaluation of abnormal results'.)Evaluation of bleeding — The evaluation is discussed separately. (See ""Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"" and ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Patient on anticoagulant'.)Management of bleeding depends on the underlying cause. (See 'Treatment of bleeding' below.)MANAGEMENTOverview of management considerations — Management can be challenging. Hypercoagulability appears to adversely impact prognosis, but there are no high-quality studies to support interventions that go beyond standard indications, and antithrombotic therapies carry risks of increased bleeding. In the absence of high-quality data to guide management, institutions may vary in how aggressively they approach prevention and treatment of thromboembolic complications. Enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged to help determine the best approach. Regardless of clinical trial enrollment, adherence to institutional protocols and input from individuals with expertise in hemostasis and thrombosis is advised to balance the risks of thrombosis and bleeding and guide decisions about antithrombotic therapy; bleeding caused by administration of excessive antithrombotic therapy may require prothrombotic treatments that further increase thrombotic risk.Acknowledging the lack of evidence, we agree with interim guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) [20,23]. Our approach is summarized in the table (table 1) and discussed in the following sections.Management of coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Additional options' and ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Inpatient VTE prophylaxis●Indications – Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is appropriate in all hospitalized medical, surgical, and obstetric patients with COVID-19 (algorithm 1), unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, active bleeding or serious bleeding in the prior 24 to 48 hours) or to the use of heparin (eg, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT], in which case an alternative agent such as fondaparinux may be used).•ICU – All patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) require thromboprophylaxis. As discussed below, some would empirically use intermediate dose or therapeutic dose anticoagulation in severely ill individuals in the absence of documented VTE. (See 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below.)•Medical (non-ICU) – All hospitalized medical patients should be treated with prophylactic-dose low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (or unfractionated heparin if LMW heparin is unavailable) for thromboprophylaxis. •Surgical – Perioperative VTE prophylaxis is especially important for patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized for a surgical procedure. Details of the timing and choice of agent are discussed separately. (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult orthopedic surgical patients"" and ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in adult nonorthopedic surgical patients"".)•Obstetric – We would also use VTE prophylaxis in obstetric patients with COVID-19 who are in the hospital prior to or following delivery. LMW heparin is appropriate if delivery is not expected within 24 hours and after delivery; unfractionated heparin is used if faster discontinuation is needed (eg, if delivery, neuraxial anesthesia, or an invasive procedure is anticipated within approximately 12 to 24 hours or at 36 to 37 weeks of gestation). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Hospitalized patients' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)●Dosing – Dosing (subcutaneous) is generally as follows; however, many experts are recommending higher doses for critically ill individuals, especially those in the ICU (see 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below):•Enoxaparin – For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30 mL/min, 40 mg once daily; for CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min, 30 mg once daily.•Dalteparin – 5000 units once daily.•Nadroparin – For patients ≤70 kg, 3800 or 4000 anti-factor Xa units once daily; for patients >70 kg, 5700 units once daily. In some cases, doses up to 50 anti-factor Xa units/kg every 12 hours are used. •Tinzaparin – 4500 anti-factor Xa units once daily.For patients with CrCl <15 mL/min or renal replacement therapy, we use unfractionated heparin, which is much less dependent on elimination by the kidney. The tables have more information about adjustments for kidney impairment (table 2), obesity (table 3), and pregnancy (table 4).●Supporting evidence – LMW heparin is known to reduce the risk of VTE and may have antiinflammatory properties. In a retrospective study of 449 individuals with severe COVID-19, enoxaparin (40 to 60 mg once daily) appeared to be associated with improved survival when compared to no pharmacologic prophylaxis, especially in those with a high D-dimer [11]. •The survival difference was only seen in a subset of individuals with a high sepsis-induced coagulopathy score (28-day mortality, 40 percent with heparin versus 64 percent without) or a high D-dimer, not in the cohort as a whole. •The magnitude of benefit was greater in those with higher D-dimer values. The reduced mortality became statistically significant at six times the upper limit of normal (33 versus 52 percent). One small series (16 patients) used higher prophylactic doses of nadroparin along with clopidogrel and did not report any VTE events; the small size of the study and lack of a control group limits interpretation [3]. As discussed above, a high percentage (25 to 43 percent) of individuals with COVID-19 in the ICU had VTE despite prophylactic dose anticoagulation, prompting many experts to suggest higher doses. (See 'VTE' above and 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation' below.)One study monitored antithrombin (AT) levels and provided AT concentrate for those with decreased levels [3]. However, we generally would not measure AT levels or consider AT concentrate unless an individual was known to have inherited AT deficiency or exhibited heparin resistance in association with a very low AT level. (See ""Antithrombin deficiency"", section on 'Heparin resistance'.)Indications for full-dose anticoagulation — Therapeutic dose (full-dose) anticoagulation (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours) is appropriate in the following settings, unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, active bleeding or serious bleeding in the prior 24 to 48 hours) or to the use of heparin (eg, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT], in which case an alternative agent such as fondaparinux may be used) (algorithm 1):Documented or presumed VTE — Therapeutic dose (full-dose) anticoagulation is appropriate for documented VTE, similar to individuals without COVID-19. (See 'Diagnosis of DVT or PE' above.)Full-dose anticoagulation is also reasonable in some cases of suspected VTE in which standard confirmatory testing is not available or feasible, including the following: ●In patients for whom computed tomography with pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is not feasible, the following may be sufficient to initiate treatment:•Confirmation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using bilateral compression ultrasonography of the legs.•Transthoracic echocardiography or point-of-care ultrasound that demonstrates clot in transit in the main pulmonary artery.●In patients for whom no confirmatory testing is possible, it may be reasonable to treat empirically with full-dose anticoagulation based on one or more of the following:•Sudden deterioration in respiratory status in an intubated patient consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE), especially when chest radiography and/or inflammatory markers are stable or improving and the change cannot be attributed to a cardiac cause. •Otherwise unexplained respiratory failure (eg, not due to fluid overload or acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), especially if the fibrinogen and/or D-dimer is very high. •Physical findings consistent with thrombosis (superficial thrombophlebitis or retiform purpura not explained by other conditions).For patients with acute VTE who are discharged from the hospital, extended thromboprophylaxis may be reasonable. (See 'Patients discharged from the hospital' below.) Clotting of intravascular access devices — Full-dose anticoagulation is appropriate for individuals with recurrent clotting of intravascular access devices (arterial lines, central venous catheters) despite prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation.Full-dose anticoagulation is also appropriate in those with clotting in extracorporeal circuits (continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). Details are discussed separately. (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients — The question of treatment-dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis has also been raised in critically ill individuals and those in the ICU who have not had confirmed or suspected acute VTE but are at high risk, as described above. (See 'VTE' above.)Many centers are recommending intermediate dose or even therapeutic intensity anticoagulation in these individuals. There are no data comparing different levels of anticoagulation in these patients (prophylactic, intermediate, or therapeutic dosing), and clinical trials are in progress. Enrollment in such a trial is encouraged. As stated by the American Society of Hematology (ASH), empiric full-dose anticoagulation for individuals who do not have VTE remains controversial, since data demonstrating improved outcomes are lacking, and some of the risk factors for VTE are also risk factors for increased risk of bleeding [22]. Thus, if VTE is suspected, confirmatory testing should be obtained or other indications for full-dose anticoagulation should be sought if possible, especially in individuals who are not in the ICU. This testing and other findings that support therapeutic dose anticoagulation are discussed above. (See 'Diagnosis of DVT or PE' above.)Indications for tPA — Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is appropriate for usual indications, unless there is a contraindication:●Limb-threatening DVT – (See ""Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy in deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity: Patient selection and administration"".)●Massive PE – (See ""Approach to thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) therapy in acute pulmonary embolism: Patient selection and administration"".)●Acute stroke – (See ""Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke"".)  ●Acute myocardial infarction – (See ""Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: The use of fibrinolytic therapy"".) Consultation with the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) or stroke team in decision-making is advised if possible. In contrast, we are not using tPA in individuals with nonspecific findings such as hypoxia or laboratory evidence of hypercoagulability. A case series described administration of tPA to three individuals with ARDS associated with COVID-19 who did not have access to or were not eligible for other interventions such as ECMO [24]. One individual had transient improvement in laboratory parameters but ultimately died. The other two had improvement in laboratory parameters; clinical outcomes were not described.Outpatient thromboprophylaxisPatients discharged from the hospital — Individuals with documented VTE require a minimum of three months of anticoagulation, as discussed separately. (See ""Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"", section on 'Duration of therapy' and ""Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults"".)Some individuals who have not had a VTE may also warrant extended thromboprophylaxis following discharge from the hospital:●We would be most likely to use post-discharge prophylactic anticoagulation in individuals with other risk factors for VTE such as immobilization, recent surgery, or trauma. ●We would use other criteria similar to those used in the APEX and MARINER trials, including immobility and older age. Most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 would meet these criteria. ●However, bleeding risk also needs to be incorporated into decision-making. ●Options for post-discharge prophylaxis include those used in clinical trials, such as rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 31 to 39 days or betrixaban 160 mg on day 1 followed by 80 mg once daily for 35 to 42 days [25]. This subject is discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults"", section on 'Duration of prophylaxis'.) Patients not admitted to the hospital — Outpatient thromboprophylaxis may also be appropriate for selected individuals with COVID-19 who are not admitted to the hospital, especially those with other thrombotic risk factors such as prior VTE or recent surgery, trauma, or immobilization, noting that this practice is based on clinical judgment. There are no trials that address thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19.If thromboprophylaxis is used in an outpatient, we would use a regimen such as rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 31 to 39 days or betrixaban 160 mg on day 1 followed by 80 mg once daily for 35 to 42 days [25]. Treatment of bleeding — Bleeding does not appear to be a major manifestation of COVID-19. However, patients may have bleeding for other reasons, including trauma and/or treatment with anticoagulation. (See 'Bleeding' above.)The approach to bleeding is similar to individuals without COVID-19 and may involve anticoagulant reversal and/or discontinuation, transfusions for thrombocytopenia or hypofibrinogenemia, or specific therapies such as factor replacement.●Anticoagulant-associated bleeding – (See ""Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR"" and ""Management of bleeding in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants"" and ""Reversal of anticoagulation in intracranial hemorrhage"".)●Trauma coagulopathy – (See ""Acute coagulopathy associated with trauma"".)●An underlying bleeding disorder such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), hemophilia, or von Willebrand disease (VWD) – (See ""Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Initial treatment and prognosis"" and ""Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B"" and ""von Willebrand disease (VWD): Treatment of major bleeding and major surgery"".)Antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, epsilon aminocaproic acid) are generally not used in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), due to the concern that they may tip the balance towards thrombosis. Thus, they should be avoided in patients in whom the COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state is the predominant finding. (See 'Distinction from DIC' above and ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Prevention/treatment of bleeding'.)Fibrinogen is often increased in COVID-19, and supplementation with fibrinogen is not required unless there is bleeding that is attributable to hypofibrinogenemia or dysfibrinogenemia (fibrinogen activity level <150 to 200 mg/dL). (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above and ""Disorders of fibrinogen"", section on 'Treatment/prevention of bleeding'.)Investigational therapies — A number of therapies for COVID-19 are under investigation, some of which may impact thrombotic risk. However, effects of these treatments on hemostasis in this patient population have not been well studied. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Participation in clinical trials is encouraged in order to improve understanding of the most effective and safest means of preventing and treating thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Investigational therapies may be appropriate in life-threatening situations or as part of a clinical trial, and markedly increased D-dimer may be used as one criterion for identifying individuals with a worse prognosis. Close monitoring for clinical signs of thrombosis or bleeding is advised in all individuals with COVID-19, with input from an individual with expertise in hemostasis and thrombosis in those with severe or unusual presentations.SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"") ●Society guidelines for patients (see ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a hypercoagulable state associated with acute inflammatory changes and laboratory findings that are distinct from acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), save for those with very severe disease. Fibrinogen and D-dimer are increased, with typically only modest prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and mild thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis of these abnormalities is incompletely understood, and there may be many contributing factors related to the acute inflammatory response to the disease. (See 'Pathogenesis' above.)●The risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is markedly increased, especially in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), with case series reporting prevalences of 25 to 43 percent in ICU patients, often despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. The risk for other thrombotic events (stroke, microvascular thrombosis) is less clear. (See 'Clinical features' above.)●All patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 should have a baseline complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer. Repeat testing is done according to the patient's clinical status. Outpatients do not require coagulation testing. The main purpose of this testing is to obtain prognostic information that may be used to inform level of care. (See 'Routine testing (all patients)' above.)●Imaging studies are appropriate for suspected VTE if feasible. If standard diagnostic studies are not feasible, other options for determining the need for therapeutic dose anticoagulation are available, as discussed above. Laboratory abnormalities that are not typical of COVID-19 should be further evaluated, as described above. (See 'Role of additional testing' above.)●Management is challenging due to the acuity of the illness and a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding efficacy and safety of different approaches to prevent or treat thromboembolic complications of the disease. Our general approach, which is summarized in the table (table 1) and depicted in the algorithm (algorithm 1), includes:•All inpatients should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin is preferred but unfractionated heparin can be used if LMW heparin is unavailable or if kidney function is severely impaired. Some institutional protocols include more aggressive anticoagulation with intermediate dose or even therapeutic dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis. (See 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' above and 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' above.)•Therapeutic dose (full-dose) anticoagulation is appropriate to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), unless contraindicated. (See 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation' above.)•Bleeding is unusual. If it occurs, treatment is similar to non-COVID-19 patients and may include transfusions, anticoagulant reversal or discontinuation, or specific products for underlying bleeding disorders. (See 'Treatment of bleeding' above.)•Participation in clinical trials is encouraged in order to improve understanding of the most effective and safest means of preventing and treating thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Disease-specific therapies under investigation may impact thrombotic risk, but the effects of these treatments on hemostasis in this patient population have not been well-documented.

In pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia, these early data show approximately the same rate of intensive care unit admissions as their nonpregnant counterparts. A single maternal death has been reported in the medical literature. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Course in pregnancy'.)Does COVID-19 increase the risk for pregnancy complications?Yes, infected women, especially those who develop pneumonia, appear to have an increased frequency of preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of gestation) and cesarean delivery, which is likely related to severe maternal illness. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Pregnancy complications'.)Does SARS-CoV-2 cross the placenta?There is no definite evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crosses the placenta and infects the fetus; however, a few cases of possible in utero infection have been reported. These may have been false-positive test results or acquisition of infection soon after birth. Reports of COVID-19 infection in the neonate have generally described mild disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Vertical transmission'.)How can prenatal care be modified to decrease risk of contracting COVID-19?The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine support modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits to limit person-to-person contact and thus help prevent spread of COVID-19. Modifications should be tailored for low- versus high-risk pregnancies (eg, multiple gestation, hypertension, diabetes) and may include telehealth, reducing the number of in-person visits, timing of visits, grouping tests (eg, aneuploidy, diabetes, infection screening) to minimize maternal contact with others, restricting visitors during visits and tests, timing of indicated obstetric ultrasound examinations, and timing and frequency of use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Routine prenatal care in asymptomatic women'.)Should low-dose aspirin be avoided in pregnant women with COVID-19?Concern about possible negative effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for whom low-dose aspirin is indicated (eg, prevention of preeclampsia), ACOG suggests an individualized approach to continuation versus discontinuation. For example, continuing preeclampsia prophylaxis is likely not worthwhile in severely or critically ill patients or near term. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications'.)Should antenatal glucocorticoids be avoided in pregnant women with COVID-19?For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because they have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. However, the CDC have not addressed use of antenatal glucocorticoids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from preterm birth.Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. However, for pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation and at risk of preterm birth within seven days, the benefits to the neonate are less clear, and ACOG has advised not administering a course of betamethasone to such patients. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications'.)LABOR AND DELIVERYIs maternal COVID-19 an indication for cesarean delivery?No, COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery. Even if vertical transmission is confirmed as additional data are reported, this would not be an indication for cesarean delivery since it would increase maternal risk and would be unlikely to improve newborn outcome. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Route of delivery'.)Should planned induction of labor or cesarean delivery of asymptomatic women be postponed during the pandemic?No, in asymptomatic women, inductions of labor and cesarean deliveries with appropriate medical indications should not be postponed or rescheduled. This includes 39-week inductions or cesarean deliveries after patient counseling. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Timing delivery in infected women'.)How should labor pain be managed in women with COVID-19?A neuraxial anesthetic is generally preferred to other options for management of labor pain because it provides good analgesia and thus reduces cardiopulmonary stress from pain and anxiety. In addition, it is available in case an emergency cesarean is required, thus obviating the need for general anesthesia. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) suggests considering suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 because of insufficient data about cleaning, filtering, and potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems. They also urge consideration of limiting use of intravenous patient controlled analgesia because of the risk of respiratory depression. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Analgesia and anesthesia'.)Can an asymptomatic partner/support person attend labor and delivery?Practices vary by institution. At a minimum, the support person should be screened in accordance with hospital policies, and those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. Most facilities recognize that a support person is important to many laboring women and permit one support person who must remain with the laboring woman (may not leave her room and then return). Additional support persons can be a part of the patient's labor and delivery via video. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Infection control precautions'.)POSTPARTUMHow should the baby be evaluated?If the mother has known COVID-19, the infant is a COVID-19 suspect and should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Infant evaluation'.)Should the mother with COVID-19 be separated from her baby?The CDC advise health care facilities to determine whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the mother's clinical condition. Separation is unnecessary if the infant's SARS-CoV-2 testing result is positive. If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, measures to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission should be utilized (eg, physical barriers, mother-baby ≥6 feet separation, maternal use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, use of a healthy adult for infant care). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Mother-baby contact'.)How long should mother-baby precautions at home continue after recent infection?After discharge from the birth facility, a mother with COVID-19 infection should maintain a distance of at least six feet from the newborn and use a face mask and hand hygiene for newborn care until (1) she is afebrile for 72 hours without use of antipyretics, (2) at least seven days have passed since symptoms first appeared, and (3) at least 72 hours have passed since improvement in respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'After hospital discharge'.)Can breast milk transmit SARS-CoV-2?It is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk. The only report of testing found no virus in the maternal milk of six patients. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)What precautions should mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 take when breastfeeding?Droplet transmission from an infected mother to her baby could occur through close contact during breastfeeding. To minimize direct contact, ideally, the infant should be fed expressed breastmilk by a healthy caregiver following hygiene precautions until the mother has recovered or proven uninfected. In such cases, the mother should use strict handwashing before pumping and wear a face mask during pumping. If this approach is not possible, mothers should take precautions to prevent transmission to the infant during breastfeeding (including assiduous hand hygiene and use of a face mask). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)Can postpartum women with COVID-19 take NSAIDs for postpartum analgesia?Concern about possible negative effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs when clinically indicated. Given the uncertainty, we suggest using acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Analgesia'.)REFERENCES — Supporting references can be found in the linked UpToDate topics.",2020-04-30 02:00:00,UPTODATE

With droplet transmission, virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes. Infection can also occur if a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) and do not linger in the air. In one report, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols under experimental conditions for at least three hours; however, whether this is clinically meaningful is uncertain.While SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in non-respiratory specimens (eg, stool, blood), neither fecal-oral nor bloodborne transmission appear to be significant sources of infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described in animals, but there is no evidence to suggest that animals are a major source of transmission. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)What is the incubation period for COVID-19?The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Incubation period'.)CLINICAL PRESENTATIONWhat are the clinical presentation and natural history of COVID-19?The spectrum of illness associated with COVID-19 is wide, ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening respiratory failure. When symptoms are present, they typically arise approximately four to five days after exposure. Symptoms are mild in approximately 80 percent of cases and often include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Smell and taste disorders have also been reported in patients with COVID-19; whether these symptoms are distinguishing features is unknown. Gastrointestinal symptoms are not frequently reported but may be the presenting feature in some patients. Headache, rhinorrhea, and sore throat are less common. Dyspnea affects approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients, typically arising five to eight days after symptom onset. Progression from dyspnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be rapid; thus, the onset of dyspnea is generally an indication for hospital evaluation and management.Pneumonia is the most common manifestation of severe disease. ARDS develops in a sizable minority of symptomatic patients and can be associated with a cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fever, progressive hypoxia and/or hypotension, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. ARDS is the leading cause of death, followed by sepsis, cardiac complications, and secondary infections. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to be between two and three percent. While severe and fatal illness can occur in anyone, the risk rises dramatically with age and the presence of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and cancer. For those who recover, illness is often prolonged, lasting approximately two weeks in those with mild disease and three to six weeks in those with severe disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Is there a way to distinguish COVID-19 clinically from other respiratory illnesses, particularly influenza?No, the clinical features of COVID-19 overlap substantially with influenza and other respiratory viral illnesses. There is no way to distinguish among them without testing. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)What factors are associated with severe COVID-19?Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but it predominantly occurs in adults with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities. Comorbidities associated with severe illness and mortality include:●Cardiovascular disease●Diabetes mellitus●Hypertension●Chronic lung disease●Cancer●Chronic kidney disease●Obesity (body mass index ≥30)Immunosuppression is also presumed to be a risk factor for severe illness and mortality, but this has not yet been definitively demonstrated in studies. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)What are the major thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19?COVID-19 is a hypercoagulable state associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), often pulmonary embolism (PE). The risk is highest in individuals in the intensive care unit (ICU), often despite prophylactic anticoagulation. The rate of arterial events is unclear, and the rate of VTE is lower in hospitalized medical patients. Bleeding is not common but has been seen, especially in the setting of trauma and/or anticoagulation. Thrombotic complications are treated with therapeutic dose anticoagulation. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'VTE'.)What are the major coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19?A number of laboratory abnormalities have been reported, including high fibrinogen and D-dimer and mild prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Abnormal coagulation studies are mainly used to monitor clinical status and to help determine level of care. Very high D-dimer is associated with a high mortality rate. Atypical findings (eg, severe thrombocytopenia) should be further evaluated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Coagulation abnormalities'.)EVALUATIONWhen should patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 be advised to stay at home? Go to the hospital?Home management is appropriate for most patients with mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea), provided they can be adequately isolated, monitored, and supported in the outpatient setting. However, there should be a low threshold to clinically evaluate patients who have any risk factor for more severe illness, even if they have only mild symptoms. Patients being managed at home should be educated about the potential for worsening disease and advised to closely monitor for symptoms of more serious disease, including dyspnea or persistent chest pain. The development of these symptoms should prompt clinical evaluation and possible hospitalization. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted'.)What are the different types of tests for COVID-19?There are two major types of tests for COVID-19: ●Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) – RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 is the primary test used to diagnose active COVID-19. The test is typically performed on nasopharyngeal swabs, but can also be performed on other respiratory tract specimens (eg, oropharyngeal swabs, lower respiratory tract samples). There are several different RT-PCR assays available, and the sensitivity and specificity of each assay differ. ●Serology – Serologic tests measure antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are primarily used to identify patients who have had COVID-19 in the past. While some serologic assays can help diagnose patients with acute infection, they are not as reliable as RT-PCR and not recommended for this purpose. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)How accurate is RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2? Should two tests be performed or one?Tests for COVID-19 are new, and determining their accuracy is challenging. A positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, false-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been well documented. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, we suggest repeating the test. In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing and concern for false-negative results, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk (residence in or travel to an area with widespread community transmission or known contact). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)HOME CAREWhat advice should be given to patients with known or presumed COVID-19 managed at home?For most patients with COVID-19 who are managed at home, we advise the following: ●Supportive care with antipyretics/analgesics (eg, acetaminophen) and hydration ●Close contact with their health care provider ●Monitoring for clinical worsening, particularly the development of dyspnea, which should prompt clinical evaluation and possible hospitalization●Separation from other household members, including pets (eg, staying in a separate room when possible and wearing a mask when in the same room)●Frequent hand washing for all family members●Frequent disinfection of commonly touched surfaces(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Outpatient management and counseling for all patients'.)How long should patients cared for at home stay isolated?The optimal duration of home isolation is uncertain. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued recommendations on discontinuation of home isolation, which include both test-based and non-test-based strategies. The choice of strategy depends upon the patient population (eg, immunocompromised versus nonimmunocompromised), the availability of testing supplies, and access to testing. When a test-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue home isolation when there is:●Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications AND●Improvement in respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) AND●Negative results of a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) When a non-test-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue home isolation when the following criteria are met:●At least seven days have passed since symptoms first appeared AND●At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery of symptoms (defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms [eg, cough, shortness of breath])In some cases, patients may have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, but they did not have any symptoms when they were tested. In such patients, home isolation may be discontinued when at least seven days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 test as long as there was no evidence of subsequent illness. However, they should continue to limit contact with other individuals and wear a face cover (eg, a cloth mask) when around others for another three days after isolation is discontinued. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)MEDICATIONSWhat are the treatment options for patients with COVID-19? Do any have proven efficacy?All agents being used for the treatment of COVID-19 are investigational. Use of these agents is generally limited to hospitalized patients who have or are at risk for severe disease. When possible, treatment should be given as part of a clinical trial. Agents that appear more promising are listed here:●Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This parenteral agent is not routinely available, but several centers in the United States and elsewhere are performing randomized trials to evaluate its efficacy. Data from these trials are emerging and remain limited; there appears to be a clinical benefit to remdesivir, but the patient population most likely to benefit is uncertain.●Hydroxychloroquine is an older, oral agent that has direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Multiple trials evaluating its efficacy for COVID-19 treatment are underway; the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for adolescents and adults hospitalized with COVID-19 when a clinical trial is not feasible. ●Interleukin (IL)-6 pathway inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, are used at some centers for patients with severe disease and/or evidence of cytokine release syndrome. Like the other agents listed here, evidence of efficacy is anecdotal, and additional study is underway. ●Convalescent plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 contains antibodies that could potentially hasten recovery in patients with active COVID-19. In the United States, the FDA is accepting emergency investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19.Other investigational agents include favipiravir, interferon beta, lopinavir-ritonavir, and combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin. Because all treatment options are investigational, monitoring for adverse effects is an important part of care. Registries of clinical trials can be found on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Should I use acetaminophen or NSAIDs when providing supportive care?Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been theorized to cause harm in patients with COVID-19, but there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk. Given the uncertainty, we use acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent for most patients rather than NSAIDs. If NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose. We do not routinely discontinue NSAIDs in patients using them for the management of chronic illnesses. The FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) do not recommend that NSAIDs be avoided when clinically indicated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Should glucocorticoids be used for treatment of COVID-19?No, we agree with recommendations by the WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that systemic glucocorticoids not be used in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications (eg, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)Do ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the likelihood of severe COVID-19?Patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents. The membrane-bound ACE2 functions as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and because ACE inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2, there is speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for severe disease. However, there is no evidence to support an association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with more severe disease, and it is also possible that these drugs may attenuate the severity of disease. In addition, stopping these agents in some patients can exacerbate comorbid cardiovascular or kidney disease and increase mortality. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'ACE inhibitors/ARBs' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)When should anticoagulation be used, and how much?All inpatients with COVID-19 (intensive care unit [ICU], medical, surgical, and obstetric) should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated (algorithm 1). Prophylactic dose low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is preferred, but prophylactic dose unfractionated heparin can be used if LMW heparin is unavailable or if kidney function is severely impaired. Some institutional protocols include more aggressive anticoagulation with intermediate dose or even therapeutic dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis, especially in the ICU, and some continue anticoagulation in selected patients following discharge. Data are lacking on the efficacy and safety of these approaches, and enrollment in a clinical trial is encouraged. Full (therapeutic)-dose anticoagulation is used for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Management'.)PREVENTION AND INFECTION CONTROLHave any medications been shown to prevent COVID-19?No agent is known to be effective for preventing COVID-19. While hydroxychloroquine is being studied as a prophylactic agent, its safety and efficacy have not been proven. We suggest that neither this medication nor any other be used for prophylaxis outside of clinical trials. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)What PPE is recommended for health care workers taking care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?Any personnel entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE): gown, gloves, eye protection (eyeglasses alone are insufficient), and a respirator (eg, an N95 respirator). If the supply of respirators is limited, facemasks are an acceptable alternative, except during aerosol-generating procedures (eg, tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, bronchoscopy, noninvasive ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Health care workers should be aware of the appropriate sequence of putting on (figure 1) and taking off (figure 2) PPE to avoid contamination.In addition, patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures should be placed in negative-pressure rooms. Most other patients can be placed in a single-occupancy, neutral-pressure room with the door closed. Patients with suspected or known COVID-19 should not be placed in positive-pressure rooms. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)IMMUNITYDoes protective immunity develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection? Can reinfection occur?Antibodies to the virus are induced in those who have become infected. Preliminary evidence suggests that some of these antibodies are protective, but this remains to be definitively established. Moreover, it is unknown whether all infected patients mount a protective immune response and how long any protective effect will last. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Immunity and risk of reinfection'.)SPECIAL POPULATIONSAsthma/COPDShould patients using inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma or COPD be advised to stop these medications to prevent COVID-19?No, patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who need inhaled glucocorticoids to maintain control of their asthma or COPD should continue them at their usual dose. When indicated, inhaled steroids help to minimize risk of an asthma or COPD exacerbation and the associated need for interaction with the health care system. There is no good evidence that inhaled glucocorticoids increase susceptibility to COVID-19 or have an adverse effect on the course of infection. Stopping them may worsen asthma or COPD control and thereby increase the risk for complications of COVID-19, if acquired. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Should patients with COVID-19 and an acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD be treated with systemic glucocorticoids?Yes, patients with COVID-19 infection and a concomitant acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD should receive prompt treatment with systemic glucocorticoids as indicated by usual guidelines. Delaying therapy can increase the risk of a life-threatening exacerbation. While the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend glucocorticoids not be routinely used in the treatment of COVID-19 infection, exacerbations of asthma and COPD are considered appropriate indications for use. Overall, the known benefits of systemic glucocorticoids for exacerbations of asthma and COPD outweigh the potential harm in COVID-19 infection. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeedingWhat special considerations are there for pregnant and breastfeeding women?Issues related to COVID-19 during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: Questions and answers"".)BLOOD DONATIONWhat should I tell patients about donating blood or plasma during the pandemic?Blood donation is particularly important during the pandemic due to concerns that the supply could become critically low. Having a history of COVID-19 is not an exclusion to donation as long as the illness resolved at least 28 days prior to donation. Persons who have recovered from COVID-19 are encouraged to donate plasma, because convalescent plasma is an investigational treatment for COVID-19. Information on where to donate blood or plasma can be found at the American Red Cross and the AABB websites or by contacting community blood centers. (See ""Blood donor screening: Medical history"", section on 'COVID-19 pandemic revised deferral criteria' and ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)REFERENCESSupporting references can be found in the linked UpToDate topics.",2020-04-30 02:00:00,UPTODATE
ID:127419,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues,"INTRODUCTION — A novel coronavirus was identified in late 2019 as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It has since rapidly spread resulting in a pandemic. The World Health Organization designated the disease term COVID-19 (ie, Coronavirus Disease 2019) [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The major morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 is largely due to acute viral pneumonitis that evolves to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of patients who become critically ill due to COVID-19. Other aspects of COVID-19, and other coronavirus-related diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)GUIDELINES AND HOSPITAL POLICIES — The advice in this topic is based upon data derived from the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, emerging retrospective data in patients with COVID-19, expert opinion, and anecdotal observations of clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 in China, Italy, and Washington state (USA), where the large outbreaks have occurred. Guidelines have been issued by several societies and organizations including the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the Chinese Thoracic Society, the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS), the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health [2-7]. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)Learning from regions that have dealt with the overwhelming burden of COVID-19 to date, it is essential that all hospitals and health systems develop task forces to manage patients admitted with this disorder. This involves, but is not limited to, designating COVID-19-specific intensive care units (ICUs) and ICU teams, creating back up and expanded staffing schedules, utilizing detailed protocols for infection prevention and medical management, accessing research trials for patients with COVID-19, ensuring adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies and training, forecasting demand, and prioritizing diagnostic lab testing.EPIDEMIOLOGY — Reports suggest that among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), up to 20 percent develop severe disease requiring hospitalization [8-15]. Although rates vary, among those who are hospitalized, up to one-quarter need intensive care unit (ICU) admission, representing approximately 5 to 8 percent of the total infected population. Differences in the rates of ICU admission may relate to cultural differences in practice and admission criteria for ICU as well as differences in predisposing factors such as age and comorbidities and testing availability in the populations served.  ●China – In the Chinese cohorts, rates of ICU admission or severe illness ranged from 7 to 26 percent [9,10,15,16]. ●Italy - Consistent with the range reported in China, preliminary reports from Italy suggest that the proportion of ICU admissions were between 5 and 12 percent of the total positive SARS-CoV-2 cases, and 16 percent of all hospitalized patients [17,18]. ●United States of America – In an early study of 21 critically ill patients in Washington State, USA, 81 percent of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the ICU and 71 percent were mechanically ventilated [19]. However, this high rate likely reflects the older age of the population which largely came from a nursing home in the region. A larger analysis of 2449 patients reported hospitalization rates of 20 to 31 percent and ICU admission rates of 4.9 to 11.5 percent [20].While three-quarters of critically ill patients were male in the Chinese cohorts, data are mixed with some reports suggesting an equal proportion of men and women [18,19] and other suggesting a male predominance [21,22]. CLINICAL FEATURES IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTSClinical features — General clinical features of COVID-19 patients and risk factors for progression are discussed separately (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'). Discussion here is limited to clinical features in those who are critically ill.●Rate of progression – Retrospective studies of critically ill patients have suggested that among patients who develop critical illness, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), onset of dyspnea is relatively late (median 6.5 days after symptom onset), but progression to ARDS can be swift thereafter (median 2.5 days after onset of dyspnea) [9,10,19,23,24]. ●Clinical features – Among those who are critically ill, profound acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS is the dominant finding [8-10,19,21,22,24-26]. Hypercapnia is rare. Fevers tend to wax and wane during ICU admission. The need for mechanical ventilation in those who are critically ill is high ranging from 42 to 100 percent [9,19,21,22,25]. ●Complications – Common complications of COVID-19-related ARDS include acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated liver enzymes, and cardiac injury including cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. As an example, in a single-center retrospective cohort from China of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, complications included AKI (29 percent; half of whom needed renal replacement therapy), liver dysfunction (29 percent), and cardiac injury (23 percent) [9]. •Cardiac injury appears to be a late complication, developing after the respiratory illness improves. A high rate of cardiomyopathy was noted in a United States cohort (33 percent), and may relate to the older age in that population [19]. In another United States cohort in New York City, cardiac complications among mechanically ventilated patients included atrial arrhythmias (18 percent), myocardial infarction (8 percent), and heart failure (2 percent) [27]. Cardiac complications of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"".)•Sepsis, shock, and multi-organ failure do occur but appear to be less common when compared with non-COVID-19-related ARDS. The need for vasoactive agents is variable, although a significant proportion need vasopressor support for hypotension (often due to sedation medications or cardiac dysfunction). In the cohort study from Wuhan, China, 35 percent of 52 patients received vasoactive agents [9]. In contrast, in the case series from New York City, 95 percent of the 130 patients who received mechanical ventilation required vasopressor support; the reasons for this were not specified [27]. •As above, acute kidney injury is common among critically ill patients with COVID-19, and many require renal replacement therapy. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Acute kidney injury'.)•Data on the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia are limited, but it does not appear to be a major feature of COVID-19. In a cohort of intubated patients from China, hospital-acquired pneumonia, in many cases with resistant pathogens, was reported in 12 percent [9]. This finding may be related to the high use of glucocorticoids for ARDS management in China. Further data are needed to elucidate the rate of superinfection in other countries.  •Lung compliance is high compared with other etiologies of ARDS and the rate of barotrauma appears to be low with only 2 percent developing pneumothorax, compared with 25 percent of those with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [9,28]. There are limited data describing the lung pathology in patients with COVID-19. Case reports from post mortem cases and patients undergoing biopsy for another reason suggest a wide variation from mononuclear inflammation to diffuse alveolar damage, classic of ARDS [29,30]. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and etiology in adults"", section on 'Pathologic stages'.)•Neurologic complications in critically ill patients are common, especially delirium or encephalopathy which manifests with prominent agitation and confusion along with corticospinal tract signs (hyperreflexia). Consistent with this, intensivists have observed that sedation requirements are high in this population, particularly immediately after intubation. In one series of 58 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, delirium/encephalopathy was present in approximately two-thirds of patients [31]. In addition, three of 13 patients who had brain MRI had an acute ischemic stroke; eight MRI studies demonstrated leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in seven patients was acellular and only one had elevated CSF protein; PCR assays of CSF were negative for the virus. It is unclear whether the neurologic complications noted in this and other reports are due to critical illness, medication effects, or represent more direct effects of cytokines or the SARS-CoV-2 virus [31-33]. Encephalitis, while reported, is rare [34]. •COVID-coagulopathy is common in this population with some patients developing abnormal coagulation profiles and other developing thrombosis. These features are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●Laboratory – Laboratory findings in critically ill patients (eg leukopenia, lymphopenia, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, normal or low procalcitonin) are initially modest and similar to those with milder illness, although the procalcitonin level may be more elevated and lymphopenia more profound in critically ill patients [8,10,26]. (See ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings' and ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)Some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin, interleukin-6), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines; these laboratory abnormalities have been associated with poor prognosis [35]. Clinical trials of anti-IL-6 agents for the treatment of COVID-19 are in progress. Further details regarding CRS are provided separately. (See ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings' and ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.) The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies has also been described; however, they are mostly of the IgA subclass, and the clinical significance is unclear [36]. Abnormal coagulation parameters which are commonly seen in COVID-19 patients (eg, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time) are also discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"" and ""Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome"".)●Imaging – Typical imaging findings do not appear to be different in mild or severe cases of COVID-19 (eg, ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia, minimal or no pleural effusions) [9,37]. While imaging with chest computed tomography (CT) was commonly performed in Chinese cohorts, we prefer to avoid its use, unless necessary; if chest CT is used as a diagnostic tool, its use must be balanced with the risk to other patients and healthcare workers during the process of patient transport and time spent in the CT room. Characteristic findings on bedside lung ultrasound include thickening of the pleural line and B lines supporting alveolar consolidation. Pleural effusions are unusual [38]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.) Early clinical reports suggest that length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay appears to be long with many patients remaining intubated for one to two weeks or longer [22]. Reports from experts in the field suggest that many patients fail early attempts at weaning (eg, within the first week), although this does not appear to predict their eventual ability to wean and extubate. No data on the proportion of patients requiring tracheostomy has been reported.Risk factors for progression — Age appears to be the major risk factor that predicts progression to ARDS [12,19,20,25]. Comorbidities, high fever (≥39°C), history of smoking, and select laboratory features also predict progression and death from COVID-19. Importantly, adults of any age may develop severe disease and experience adverse outcomes, especially those with comorbidities. Further details regarding the risk of disease progression are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)RESPIRATORY CARE OF THE NONINTUBATED PATIENT — Specific aspects of respiratory care relevant to deteriorating patients with COVID-19 before admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) are discussed here (table 1). These include oxygenation with low flow and high-flow systems, noninvasive ventilation and the administration of nebulized medications. For hospitalized patients who develop progressive symptoms, early admission to the ICU is prudent when feasible. Some experts are encouraging that the hospitalized patient spend as much time as is feasible and safe in the prone position while receiving oxygen; the rationale for this approach is based upon limited direct evidence [39] and anecdotal observations in the field as well as indirect evidence of its efficacy in ventilated patients. (See 'Prone ventilation' below.)Oxygenation targets — The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests titrating oxygen to a target peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of ≥90 percent. For most critically ill patients, we prefer the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting a SpO2 between 90 and 96 percent, if feasible. However, some patients may warrant a lower target (eg, patients with a concomitant acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) and others may warrant a higher target (eg, pregnancy). (See ""Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Fraction of inspired oxygen'.) Low flow oxygen — For patients with COVID-19, supplemental oxygenation with a low flow system via nasal cannula is appropriate (ie, up to 6 L/min). Although the degree of micro-organism aerosolization at low flow rates is unknown, it is reasonable to surmise that it is minimal. Higher flows of oxygen may be administered using a simple face mask, venturi face mask, or nonrebreather mask (eg, up to 10 to 20 L/minute), but as flow increases, the risk of dispersion also increases, augmenting the contamination of the surrounding environment and staff. Some experts have suggested having patients who wear nasal cannula wear a droplet mask (eg, during transport to protect spread to the surrounding environment), although data to support this are nonexistent. (See ""Continuous oxygen delivery systems for the acute care of infants, children, and adults"".)Patients with higher oxygen requirements — As patients progress, higher amounts of oxygen are needed. Options at this point in non-COVID-19 patients are high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) or the initiation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). However, in patients with COVID-19, this decision is controversial and subject to ongoing debate [40,41]. Despite this controversy, both modalities have been used variably. In retrospective cohorts, rates for HFNC use ranged from 14 to 63 percent while 11 to 56 percent were treated with NIV [9,22,25]. However, there are no data describing whether these modalities were successful at avoiding intubation.   Deciding on a modality (noninvasive or invasive ventilation) — We believe that the decision to initiate noninvasive modalities, HFNC or NIV, should be made by balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of resources; this approach should be reassessed as new data become available. We encourage the development of hospital protocols and a multidisciplinary approach, which includes respiratory therapy staff, to facilitate this decision. In patients with COVID-19 who have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and higher oxygen needs than low flow oxygen can provide, we suggest that noninvasive modalities, may be used selectively rather than proceeding directly to intubation (eg, a younger patient without comorbidities who can tolerate nasal cannulae). On the other hand, some patients may warrant avoidance of HFNC and may benefit from proceeding directly to early intubation (eg, elderly or confused patient with comorbidities and several risk factors for progression). Many experts advocate the avoidance of both modalities (ie, proceeding to early intubation if escalating beyond 6 L/min with continued hypoxemia or increased work of breathing). This is predicated on an increased risk of aerosolization and high likelihood that patients who need these modalities will ultimately, rapidly deteriorate and require mechanical ventilation (eg, within one to three days). This approach may be reasonable when resources are available. However, using this as an absolute rule may result in an excess of unnecessary intubations and place an undue load on ventilator demand as the disease surges. In addition, this is particularly problematic for patients under investigation (eg, COVID-19 testing pending), patients who have chronic nocturnal NIV requirements, patients with chronic respiratory failure who have high baseline oxygen requirements, and patients with do-not-intubate status but who might benefit otherwise from NIV or HFNC. Ultimately, these recommendations may change with time depending on the case load of COVID-19 patients in a given location.   Oxygen via high flow nasal cannula versus noninvasive ventilation — Among the noninvasive modalities, we prefer HFNC. Our preference for HFNC is based upon limited and inconsistent data, which, on balance, favor HFNC compared with NIV in patients with non-COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the details of which are provided separately (see ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure'). In addition, limited data suggest a high failure rate of NIV in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [42] and other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (see ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure NOT due to ACPE'). However, NIV may be appropriate in patients with indications that have proven efficacy; these include patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and patients with sleep disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation). These data are provided separately. (See ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'.)  Monitoring on noninvasive modalities — If HFNC or NIV is administered, vigilant monitoring of patients is warranted for progression with frequent clinical and arterial blood gas evaluation every one to two hours to ensure efficacy and safe ventilation (eg, frequent coughing may not be “safe”). We advocate a low threshold to intubate such patients, particularly if they show any signs of rapid progression. (See 'Timing' below.)Although unproven, some experts, including us, provide HFNC (or NIV) while the patient is in the prone position. Limited evidence from case reports in non-COVID patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and anecdotal evidence suggest feasibility and improvement in oxygenation in some patients [39,43,44].  Technical details regarding application of HFNC and NIV are provided separately. (See ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"" and ""Noninvasive ventilation adults with acute respiratory failure: Practical aspects of initiation"" and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"".)Precautions for noninvasive modalities — HFNC and NIV are considered aerosol generating procedures. Thus, when HFNC or NIV is used, airborne in addition to standard precautions should be undertaken (ie, airborne infection isolation room [also known as a negative pressure room], full personal protective equipment). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●HFNC – We advocate additionally placing a surgical or N95 mask on the patient during HFNC when healthcare workers are in the room, but the value of this practice is unknown [3]. Additional precautions for HFNC that have potential to reduce risk include starting at and using the lowest effective flow rate (eg, 20 L/minute and 0.4 FiO2). Inhaled medications or gases (eg, epoprostenol, nitric oxide bronchodilators) should be avoided during HFNC. ●NIV – If NIV is initiated, a full-face mask rather than a nasal or oronasal mask is preferred to minimize particle dispersion. The mask should preferably have a good seal and not have an anti-asphyxiation valve or port. Use of a helmet has been proposed for delivering NIV to patients with COVID-19 [45]. However, experience is limited with this delivery method, especially in the United States. If NIV is used, dual limb circuitry with a filter on the expiratory limb on a critical care ventilator may decrease dispersion compared with single limb circuitry on portable devices, although data to support this are lacking. We also suggest starting with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) using the lowest effective pressures (eg, 5 to 10 cm H2O).There are few data regarding aerosolization during HFNC and NIV. In a normal lung simulation study, dispersion of air during exhalation increased with increasing HFNC flow from 65 mm (at 10 L/minute) to 172 mm (at 60 L/minute) mostly along the sagittal plane (ie, above the nostrils) [46]. Similar distances were found when CPAP was delivered via nasal pillows (up to 332 mm with CPAP 20 cm H2O). However, there was no significant leakage noted when CPAP was administered via an oronasal mask with good seal (picture 1 and picture 2). Air leak increased when connections on any device were loose. Dispersion seemed to be reduced when the simulator simulated injured lung. Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients) — Nebulizers are associated with aerosolization and potentially increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In patients with suspected or documented COVID-19, nebulized bronchodilator therapy should be reserved for acute bronchospasm (eg, in the setting of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation). Otherwise, nebulized therapy should generally be avoided, in particular for indications without a clear evidence-base; however some uses (eg, hypertonic saline for cystic fibrosis) may need to be individualized. Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) with spacer devices should be used instead of nebulizers for management of chronic conditions (eg, asthma or COPD controller therapy). Patients can use their own MDIs if the hospital does not have them on formulary.If nebulized therapy is used, patients should be in an airborne infection isolation room, and healthcare workers should use contact and airborne precautions with appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE); this includes a N95 mask with goggles and face shield or equivalent (eg, powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR] mask]) as well as gloves and gown. All non-essential personnel should leave the room during nebulization. Some experts also suggest not re-entering the room for two to three hours following nebulizer administration. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Other — Potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should inform the use of other interventions in patients with documented or suspected COVID-19: ●It is prudent to minimize the following: •Positive airway devices for chronic nocturnal ventilation support•Chest physical therapy or oscillatory devices•Oral or airway suctioning●Sputum induction should be avoided●Bronchoscopy should be avoided in spontaneously breathing patients and limited to therapeutic indications (eg, life-threatening hemoptysis, central airway stenosis)If any of these therapies are performed, similar PPE to that described for nebulizer therapy should be used. (See 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)' above and ""Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview"".) THE DECISION TO INTUBATETiming — Timing of intubation in this population is challenging. Most patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 will warrant intubation and mechanical ventilation. Delaying intubation until the patient acutely decompensates is potentially harmful to the patient and healthcare workers and is not advised. For patients with escalating oxygen requirements, we monitor clinical and gas exchange parameters every one to two hours and have a low threshold to intubate patients with the following:●Rapid progression over hours  ●Lack of improvement on >40 L/minute of high flow oxygen and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) >0.6●Evolving hypercapnia, increasing work of breathing, increasing tidal volume, worsening mental status ●Hemodynamic instability or multiorgan failureMost experts with experience managing COVID-19 patients suggest “early” intubation. However, the definition of what constitutes “early” is unclear. Use of noninvasive means are traditionally used to avoid intubation. However, their use is subject to controversy in patients with COVID-19 (see 'Patients with higher oxygen requirements' above). Clinicians should communicate closely and regularly about the potential for intubation in patients that are being followed and treated noninvasively so that the transition for intubation can be smooth and rapid once it has been identified that the patient needs intubation.  Precautions — Intubation is the highest risk procedure for droplet dispersion in patients with COVID-19 [40]. The following discussion is suitable for patients outside the operating room (eg, intensive care unit [ICU] and emergency department) (table 2). ●We are proponents of the development of intubation kits and intubation checklists for performing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in this population (figure 1). ●Attention should be paid to donning full contact and airborne personal protective equipment (PPE) (figure 2 and figure 3) [40]. Appropriate PPE includes a fit-tested disposable N95 respirator mask (picture 3), with eye protection or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), also known as an isolation suit (picture 4 and picture 5). Also included are gown, caps and beard covers, protective footwear, and gloves (using the double glove technique). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●Intubation should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room, if possible.●Intubation should be performed by the most qualified individual (eg, anesthesiologist) since delayed intubation with multiple attempts may prolong dispersion and place the patient at risk of a respiratory arrest.  ●Anecdotally, most experts suggest optimizing preoxygenation with nonaerosol-generating means (eg, avoidance of high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannula) and intubation using video laryngoscopy. In patients previously on high flow oxygen, some experts switch to 100 percent nonrebreather masks for preoxygenation. ●When manual bag mask ventilation (BMV) is needed, switching the mask to a supraglottic device for manual bagging is appropriate. When feasible, BMV should be minimized before and after intubation, and a bacterial/viral high efficiency hydrophobic filter should be placed between the facemask and breathing circuit or resuscitation bag. Having a pre-prepared bag-mask with filter attached in every room with a COVID-19 patient is prudent. Using a two-person technique for an adequate face mask seal is also suggested.●Clamping the endotracheal tube (ETT) for connections and disconnections is appropriate (eg, capnography testing following intubation). ●The ventilator and ventilator circuitry should be ready in advance with preplanned settings already entered so that as soon as the ETT is placed and confirmed with capnography, it can be connected directly to the ETT without additional manual bagging. In addition, if feasible, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy should be prepared and attached to the ventilator tubing in advance in order to avoid unnecessary disconnection for their placement at a later point in time. The expiratory limb on the ventilator should have a HEPA filter to decrease aerosolization to the environment. ●To minimize exposure, bundling intubation with other procedures is appropriate as is bundling the chest radiograph for ETT and central venous catheter placement.New proposals are emerging for novel barrier protections for intubation. In one such pilot study, manually performing intubation inside a transparent box was described (“aerosol box”) [47]. The box was designed so that it could be placed over a patient’s head allowing intubation to be performed through two circular ports on the cephalad side of the box. In a simulation experiment, cough was approximated using a latex balloon and fluorescent dye. Use of the box was associated with significant reduction in aerosol deposition to the individual performing intubation, their PPE clothing, and the surrounding environment, when compared with the same simulation without the box. While proposed as an adjunct to protection, restriction of hand movements may be encountered during airway manipulation that would necessitate abandoning the procedure and the simulation may not accurately mimic the aerosolization behavior of virus particles. Such devices are not yet commercially available.  Detailed guidance regarding intubation in the operating room, optimal personal protective equipment, and procedural details regarding intubation itself are discussed separately. (See ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19' and ""Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults"" and ""Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room"" and ""The decision to intubate"" and ""Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room"" and ""Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside of the operating room"".)VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME — Most patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated appear to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Accurate data on duration of ventilation are limited but suggest prolonged mechanical ventilation for two weeks or more (table 1). All of the steps discussed below should proceed as resources allow. Whether different phases of COVID-19 pneumonitis require different ventilatory strategies is unclear. One school of thought is that in the early phase of COVID-19, severe hypoxemia is associated with high compliance and low alveolar recruitability (atypical ARDS), while in the later phase, severe hypoxemia is associated with low lung compliance and high recruitability (classic ARDS) [48,49]. However, this hypothesis, remains unproven and optimal ventilatory strategies based upon it are unclear. Until further data are available, we prefer a strategy that promotes lung protection as outlined in the sections below.Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) — As for all patients with ARDS, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who develop ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation should receive LTVV targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW; range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW (table 3 and table 4)). We typically use a volume-limited assist control mode, beginning with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW, which targets a plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤30 cm H2O, and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table (table 5). This approach is based upon several randomized trials and meta-analyses that have reported improved mortality from LTVV in patients with ARDS. The experience among Chinese, Italian, and United States cohorts is that this approach is also beneficial in this population. Modifications to or deviations from this mechanical ventilation strategy may be required in the setting of severe hypercapnia or ventilator dyssynchrony (figure 4). (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Patients who are not improving or deteriorating'.)Anecdotal reports suggest that the COVID-19 ARDS phenotype is one of severe hypoxemia that is responsive to high PEEP with relatively high lung compliance such that Pplat ≤30 cm H2O is not difficult to achieve. As a consequence, we and other clinicians have a low threshold to start with higher than usual levels of PEEP (eg, 10 to 15 cm H2O).Expanded details on LTVV and other ventilator strategies in ARDS are provided separately. (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"".)   We believe that oxygenation goals in critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be similar to those in nonventilated patients (ie, peripheral oxygen saturation between 90 and 96 percent (see 'Oxygenation targets' above)). However, in patents with COVID-19, some experts use a higher peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) goal [7]. The rationale for this approach is that it may reduce the frequency of ventilator adjustments that require staff entry into the room, thereby reducing the risk to healthcare staff, although data are lacking to support it.Reflecting the practice of LTVV, one retrospective Italian cohort reported that the median level of PEEP was 14 cm H2O (interquartile range [IQR] 12 to 16 cm H2O) [22]. Ninety percent of patients required an FiO2 >0.5, and the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 160 (IQR, 114 to 220).Failure of low tidal volume ventilation — For patients with COVID-19 that fail to achieve adequate oxygenation with LTVV, we agree with other experts in the field who have chosen prone ventilation as the preferred next step. For its application, we use similar criteria to those in non-COVD-19 patients (ie, partial arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2:FiO2] ratio <150 mmHg, a FiO2 ≥0.6, and PEEP ≥5 cm H2O; excessively high airway pressures; or recalcitrant hypoxemia), although some experts use a higher PaO2:FiO2 ratio, given the good response seen in this population.  Prone ventilation — Our preference for using prone ventilation is based on its known efficacy in patients with ARDS as well as limited and anecdotal observations of intensivists in the field who have noted that unlike patients who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), patients with COVID-19-related ARDS respond well to this maneuver [50]. Those who are experienced in ventilating patients with COVID-19-related ARDS also promote ventilating patients prone for as long as is feasible without prematurely returning the patient to the supine position (ie, 12 to 16 hours prone per day) and to perform the maneuver at change of shift when sufficient staff are available. The utmost care should be taken to avoid ventilator disconnections during proning and the number of personnel should be limited to that required for turning. This video which describes the prone procedure is freely available. Additional details regarding the efficacy, contraindications (table 6) and application (table 7) of prone ventilation are provided separately. (See ""Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Ventilator strategies to maximize alveolar recruitment'.) The good response to prone positioning may be due to preserved lung compliance in this population compared with patients who develop ARDS from other etiologies. Lung compliance is the change in lung volume for a given pressure. It can be measured using the following equations: lung compliance (C) = change in lung volume (V) / change in transpulmonary pressure (alveolar pressure [Palv] – pleural pressure [Ppl]); static lung compliance = tidal volume / Pplat – PEEP. The normal lung compliance is approximately 200 mL/cm H2O and in general compliance >50 mL/cm H2O has been noted by clinicians who have experienced ventilating patients with COVID-19. Optimal timing and criteria for discontinuing prone ventilation is unclear and should be performed on an individualized basis. It is not unreasonable to use criteria similar to that in studies that have shown benefit in non-COVID-related ARDS (eg PaO2:FiO2 ≥150 mmHg, FiO2 ≤0.6, PEEP ≤10 cm H2O) maintained for at least four hours after the end of the last prone session) [51].Additional options — Additional options for patients in whom prone ventilation fails include the following:●Recruitment and high PEEP – Recruitment maneuvers and high PEEP strategies (table 8) may be performed to address severe hypoxemia; data supporting their use in non COVID-19-related ARDS is described separately. (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Ventilator strategies to maximize alveolar recruitment'.)●Pulmonary vasodilators – Pulmonary vasodilators may improve ventilation-perfusion mismatch in those with severe hypoxemia and may be particularly helpful in those with hypoxemia from an acute pulmonary arterial hypertension crisis. The two most commonly used agents are inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and inhaled prostacyclin, which are administered as a continuous inhalation. Inhaled vasodilators should only be administered through a closed system and require skilled personnel for their use. Potential risks and challenges with COVID-19 patients include aerosolization and clogging of bacterial/viral filters used in ventilator circuits when these medications are being administered. Inhaled NO may be preferred since it is associated with a lower need to change filters with resultant reduction in the risk to the respiratory healthcare provider. Further details regarding their use are described separately. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Nitric oxide' and ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Prostacyclin' and ""Inhaled nitric oxide in adults: Biology and indications for use"", section on 'Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure'.) ●Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) – NMBAs may be reserved for patients with refractory hypoxemia or ventilator dyssynchrony. We do not favor their routine use in any patient with ARDS since data on outcomes are conflicting. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Paralysis (neuromuscular blockade)' and ""Neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients: Use, agent selection, administration, and adverse effects"".) ●Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – While the World Health Organization suggests ECMO as a rescue strategy, we only use it in those who fail prone ventilation and the other evidence-based medical strategies listed above. In addition, ECMO is not universally available. As many hospitals choose to cohort patients in COVID-19-only intensive care units (ICUs), there may also be the challenge of delivering ECMO in ICUs that do not routinely care for ECMO patients; this would require the recruitment of additional specialized nursing and perfusionist staff. ECMO can also reduce the lymphocyte count and raise the interleukin-6 level, thereby interfering with the interpretation of these laboratory results [52]. (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Use of rescue strategies has varied among centers. In a single-center retrospective cohort of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, approximately 12 percent received prone ventilation and 12 percent received ECMO [9]. In contrast, in the original cohort of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, of the 17 patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, 24 percent were treated with ECMO. Similarly, in an Italian cohort, only 1 percent of critically ill patients received ECMO [22]. Additional ventilator precautions — We recommend tight seals for all ventilator circuitry and equipment. For patients who have a tracheostomy, similar recommendations apply. Although the efficacy is unproven, some experts suggest placing the ventilator and intravenous (IV) line monitors outside the room, when feasible (eg, through a wall port). This allows frequent ventilator adjustments while simultaneously decreasing the risk of exposure to staff; although the efficacy of such maneuvers is unproven. It is prudent to avoid unnecessary disconnection with the endotracheal tube (ETT) in ventilated patients with COVID-19 in order to avoid derecruitment and unnecessary exposure of virus to the environment. For example, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy are preferred, if resources allow. If disconnection is necessary (eg, during transfer when portable ventilators are used or manual bagging), the ETT should be temporarily clamped during disconnection and unclamped after reconnection. This is considered an aerosolizing procedure in which case an airborne infection isolation room is preferable but is not always feasible.Other infection precautions include use of dual limb ventilator circuitry with filters placed at the exhalation outlets as well as heat moisture exchange (HME) systems rather than heated humification of single limb circuits. HME should be placed between the exhalation port and the ETT (figure 5 and figure 6). (See ""The ventilator circuit"".)It is particularly important to adhere to the standard practice of maintaining the ETT cuff pressure between 25 and 30 cm H2O so that a tight seal exists between the cuff and the tracheal wall. (See ""Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients"", section on 'Maintain optimal cuff pressure'.)All ventilators should have appropriate filters in place and agreed upon filter change schedule (eg, every six hours). The ventilator should be wiped down after every filter change. Although an airborne isolation room is ideal, if not feasible, patients can be ventilated in a non-isolation room but need to be transported to an airborne isolation room when aerosol generating procedures take place (eg, extubation, bronchoscopy). Having a protocol in place for transport is prudent. INTERVENTIONS — Ventilated patients require frequent evaluation and develop complications that require intervention. Details relevant to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are included in this section and mostly relate to infectious precautions. In a biodistribution study of 1070 specimens obtained from 205 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens showed the highest positive rates (93 percent), followed by sputum (72 percent), nasal swabs (63 percent), fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (46 percent), pharyngeal swabs (32 percent), feces (29 percent), and blood (1 percent). No urine specimens tested positive [53]. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in several specimens, although the reported rates in this study may have been determined by the severity of illness of the individual tested. In a systematic review of 10 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to healthcare workers, endotracheal intubation had the highest risk (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 2.3-18.9), followed by noninvasive ventilation (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.8), tracheostomy (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5-11.5), and bag-mask ventilation [54]. Other procedures were associated with a lower or insignificant risk of transmission but it is not known whether they can be applied to SARS-CoV-2. For example, duration of close contact during aerosolizing procedures and precautions used were not described. Collection of respiratory specimens in the intubated patient — Some intubated patients require upper or lower respiratory tract sampling for diagnostic purposes (eg, diagnosis of COVID-19 or ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]). Technically, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs do not have to be taken under airborne precautions. However, we prefer to obtain naso-and oropharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates under airborne precautions in the intensive care unit (ICU). Nonbronchoscopic alveolar lavage (“mini-BAL”) may also be performed as an alternative to bronchoscopy, although experience in this procedure is not universal among ICUs. If mini-BAL is performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, use of smaller aliquots of lavage fluid is prudent (eg, three 10 mL aliquots to obtain 2 to 3 mL of fluid). (See ""Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia"", section on 'Invasive respiratory sampling'.)Bronchoscopy — We agree with the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) that bronchoscopy should have a limited role for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and should only be performed for this indication when upper respiratory samples are negative (ie, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, or non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage) and the suspicion remains high. Bronchoscopy may also be performed when another diagnosis is being considered and a bronchoscopic sample would change management (eg, suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii in an immunosuppressed patient) or when therapeutic bronchoscopy is indicated (eg, life-threatening hemoptysis or airway stenosis).  Bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure and should only be performed when necessary and likely to change management. Bronchoscopy through an established airway (eg, endotracheal tube [ETT]) likely carries less risk than bronchoscopy in a spontaneously breathing patient. In patients with COVID-19, bronchoscopy should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room. Airborne precautions and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned before entering the room. Using PPE similar to that described for intubation is appropriate. (See 'The decision to intubate' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Using ETTs with inline adapters for bronchoscopy is ideal to prevent disconnection from the ventilator and aerosolization. If bronchoscopy is needed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, then we suggest small aliquots of 10 mL to obtain 2 to 3 mL of lavage fluid placed in a sterile leak-proof container. Clamping suction tubing or turning off suction after the sample has been obtained before disconnecting the sample from the device is also prudent. Specimens should be in a double zip-locked sealed plastic bag, handled with the usual precautions, and labelled clearly as “COVID-19.”We prefer the use of disposable bronchoscopes, although these are not universally available. For nondisposable equipment, we recommend cleaning the suction channels with standard cleaning solutions typically used for highly infectious material. We also suggest covering or sealing any vessel containing the bronchoscope during transport after use and wiping down the transport cart and bronchoscope display tower before leaving the room. Wipe down solution should be hydrogen peroxide or equivalent and should be left wet on all surfaces for at least one minute. Extubation and weaning — Patients are often ready for extubation while they remain infectious, and because extubation is frequently associated with some coughing, it is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. Readiness for extubation should follow standard practice of performing spontaneous breathing trials. However, we suggest using closed systems and not using a T-piece. To reduce the risk of reintubation following extubation, we prefer a higher degree of readiness in patients with COVID-19, since extubation directly to high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae (HFNC) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is not desirable due to the risk of virus aerosolization. Whether the cuff leak test should be performed routinely prior to extubation is unclear. However, its performance may be guided by clinical suspicion for upper airway edema (eg, fluid overload) or the presence of risk factors for post extubation stridor (eg, prolonged intubation ≥6 days, age >80 years, large endotracheal tube, traumatic intubation). Performing the cuff leak test should be weighed against the potential risk of aerosolization, and similar to extubation, it should be preferentially done in an airborne isolation room. (See ""Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing"" and ""Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation"" and ""Weaning from mechanical ventilation: The rapid shallow breathing index"" and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19' and ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Cuff leak' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)We prefer to perform extubation in an airborne isolation room. Respiratory therapists and others in the room during extubation should adhere to airborne precautions including N95 masks with eye protection or equivalent. Extra care should be taken during extubation to keep the inline suction catheter engaged during cuff deflation. The endotracheal tube should be removed as smoothly as is feasible, and disposed of in the standard fashion. In the ICU, close communication with a clinician experienced in intubation regarding the occurrence of extubation in a COVID-19 patient is prudent, in case rapid reintubation is needed. The threshold to reintubate patients with postextubation respiratory failure should be low. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Extubation equipment and technique'.)Postextubation care should support the application of supplemental oxygen at the lowest fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) possible, preferably via low flow nasal canula. Because patients are often extubated while they remain infectious, we would advise adhering to a similar approach to oxygen delivery as before intubation. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Postextubation management' and 'Oxygenation targets' above.)For patients who fail weaning, a tracheostomy may be indicated. Tracheostomy is considered a high risk procedure for aerosolization. Weaning via tracheostomy masks should be avoided, until the patient is noninfectious. Precautions for extubation in the OR are provided separately. (See ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)Cardiopulmonary resuscitation — In the event of a cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should proceed with all members of the team wearing appropriate PPE. Practicing a test run of a COVID-19 patient cardiac arrest is prudent. Bag-mask ventilation should be avoided (if feasible); the ventilator can be used instead to deliver a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute (bpm). Guidance for advanced cardiac life support and CPR in patients who are prone and cannot be returned to the supine position is provided separately. (See ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)'.)Other interventions — Guidance is lacking regarding other procedures commonly performed in the ICU. Many intubated patients have routine indications for central venous and arterial access for monitoring and for vasoactive drug infusion. Grouping standard procedures such as central venous catheter and arterial lines immediately following intubation is appropriate to minimize the frequency of exposure. The transmission risk of blood is unknown but likely to be low [53]. Significant pleural effusions and barotrauma appear to be unusual as a manifestation of COVID-19. In general, emergently indicated procedures and interventions should be performed as indicated, with appropriate infectious precautions. (See 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)  Transfer of COVID-19 patients should be limited to necessary trips (eg, imaging for a diagnosis that would change management, travel to an airborne isolation room for high risk aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation and extubation). SUPPORTIVE CARE — General supportive care of the critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is similar to that in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to other causes and is discussed in detail separately. Select issues pertinent to COVID-19 are discussed in the sections below. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Supportive care'.) Routine measures — The supportive care of mechanically ventilated patients that also apply to patients with COVID-19 are provided in several linked topics. However, potential differences that may pertain to COVID-19 patients are discussed in this section:Venous thromboembolism prevention — We agree with the American Society of Hematology and the Society of Critical Care Medicine that routine pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is warranted, preferably with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; eg, enoxaparin 40 mg SC once daily), unless there is a contraindication (eg, bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia). For patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute, enoxaparin should be reduced to 30 mg daily or changed to unfractionated heparin, depending on the severity of kidney impairment and patient weight. Fondaparinux is appropriate in those with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults"".)Use of more aggressive VTE prophylaxis in the form of increased intensity of a pharmacologic agent or the addition of a mechanical device may be assessed on an individual basis and can be reconsidered as additional data emerge. Elevated D-dimer levels correlate with a poor prognosis, and some experts are using markedly elevated levels to guide intensification of anticoagulation. We do not advise therapeutic anticoagulation unless an indication is present, but we have a low threshold for considering VTE as the cause of deteriorating oxygenation. Direct data on the thromboembolic risk with COVID-19 are limited, although VTE, thrombosis of dialysis catheters, and dysregulated coagulation parameters have been reported [10,24,55-60]. In a series of 184 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received standard thromboprophylaxis, pulmonary embolism was noted in 25 patients (14 percent) and other thrombotic events in 6 patients [60]. Anecdotal evidence also suggests the occurrence of microvascular thrombosis [61,62]. One small retrospective Chinese case series suggested benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with a high sepsis-induced coagulation score and elevated D-dimer >6 times the upper limit of normal [63]. Another case series suggested VTE incidence of 25 percent in critically ill adults with COVID-19, but these patients did not receive routine VTE prophylaxis [58]. Further data regarding the impact of the thrombotic risk and the impact of VTE prophylaxis or anticoagulation are needed. Detailed description of the VTE risk and management of COVID-19 patients with hypercoagulability is provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)Others — Other supportive measures are included here.●Sedation and analgesia – Anecdotal evidence suggests that requirements for sedation and analgesia appear high. Consequently shortages of sedatives may influence the choice of agent. (See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal"" and ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects"" and ""Pain control in the critically ill adult patient"".)●Nutritional support – The same principles of nutrition in non COVID-19 critically ill patients should be applied to critically-ill COVID-19 patients. We are not proponents of extra protein supplementation, vitamin C or D supplementation, or trace element supplementation over and above the usual recommended daily doses. (See ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview"" and ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition"" and ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition"".)●Glucose control. (See ""Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness"".)●Stress ulcer prophylaxis. (See ""Stress ulcers in the intensive care unit: Diagnosis, management, and prevention"" and ""Management of stress ulcers"".)●Hemodynamic monitoring. (See ""Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults"" and ""Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults"" and ""Novel tools for hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill patients with shock"".)●Fever management. (See ""Fever in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Outcomes'.)●Early physical therapy. (See ""Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)"", section on 'Prevention and treatment'.)●Ventilator-associated pneumonia precautions. (See ""Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"".)Surveillance — Critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be followed routinely for the development of complications associated with critical illness from COVID-19 or extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only essential personnel should enter the rooms of infected patients when performing daily examinations, care, and procedures. Common complications include acute kidney injury, mild transaminitis, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusions, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and superinfection (eg, ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]) (see 'Clinical features' above). We suggest that daily laboratory studies include complete blood count with differential, chemistries, liver function and coagulation studies, arterial blood gases, ferritin level, D-dimer level, and lactate dehydrogenase. Serial measurement of cardiac troponins and a low threshold transthoracic echocardiogram may be helpful to evaluate for suspected cardiac injury.Daily chest radiographs are not recommended routinely for mechanically ventilated patients with or without COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated, chest radiographs should only be performed when there is an indication (eg, catheter- or endotracheal tube [ETT]-placement or a relevant clinical change). Chest computed tomography and other imaging should be limited to those in whom testing would change management. This rationale is based upon the increased risk of viral shedding with procedures that require transfer out of the intensive care unit (ICU). (See ""Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients"", section on 'Reassessment of position'.) Fluid and electrolytes management — Unless patients have sepsis or volume depletion from high fever or gastrointestinal losses, we prefer conservative fluid management typical of that advised for patients with ARDS. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Fluid management' and ""Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"", section on 'Intravenous fluids (first three hours)' and ""Treatment of severe hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults"".)The management of patients who present with septic shock due to COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with septic shock from other causes. (See ""Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"".)Glucocorticoids — We agree with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) that glucocorticoids should not be routinely administered to patients with COVID-19, unless there is a separate evidence-based indication (eg, asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation, refractory septic shock, and adrenal insufficiency). However, their administration in critically ill patients with COVID-19-related ARDS is controversial. Based on data suggesting potential benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with all-cause ARDS, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) provides a conditional, weak recommendation in favor of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19 who have severe ARDS (eg, patients with a partial arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2:FiO2] <100 mmHg). Although we also weakly recommend glucocorticoids in moderate to severe “all cause” ARDS (ie, non COVID-19-related ARDS) who fail low tidal volume ventilation, we do not suggest administering them routinely in the setting of COVID-19 and ARDS (see ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'). The rationale for not administering glucocorticoids in this population is that the data supporting any benefit did not include a sufficient proportion of patients with viral pneumonia to inform safety (eg, patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East Respiratory syndrome [MERS], or influenza); this is especially important since data in patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia were conflicting and some suggested harm [64-67]. If clinicians choose to administer glucocorticoids, the SCCM suggests that they should begin within the first 14 days, doses should be low, and courses should be short (eg, intravenous dexamethasone 20 mg IV once daily for five days, then 10 mg once daily for five days). Data in COVID-19 patients are limited to a single retrospective Chinese cohort, where methylprednisolone administration reduced the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients who did not receive methylprednisolone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38; 95% CI 0.2-0.71) [25]. However, these data are fundamentally flawed and new data gathered prospectively should shed light on this controversial issue. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)As noted above, management of patients who present with shock due to COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with septic shock from other causes (see 'Fluid and electrolytes management' above). Low dose glucocorticoids are not routinely advised for septic shock. In the setting of COVID-19 and shock, we reserve low dose glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone 200 to 400 mg/day in divided doses) for selected patients with refractory shock, in accordance with guidelines [7]. Low dose glucocorticoids are not routinely advised for non-refractory septic shock. The use of glucocorticoids in septic shock is discussed separately. (See ""Glucocorticoid therapy in septic shock in adults"", section on 'Administration'.)Nebulized medication — Nebulization is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. For patients with COVID-19 who are intubated and require bronchodilators for an evidence-based indication (eg, acute bronchospasm from asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation), we prefer the use of in-line metered dose inhalers (MDIs; ie, pressurized inhalers) rather than administration via a standard jet or vibrating mesh nebulizer due to the lower risk of aerosolization associated with MDIs [68,69]. For medications that can only be administered via a nebulizer, consideration should be given to stopping the medication if it is not essential for acute care (eg, inhaled colistin for patients with bronchiectasis) or using an MDI alternative, if available on formulary (eg, tobramycin capsule inhaler). Consideration should be given to the patient using their own supply if MDIs are not on formulary. Placement of a filter at the expiratory port of the ventilation circuit during nebulization is prudent to minimize aerosolization into the room. Ideally, patients who require nebulizers, should be in an airborne infection isolation room. Only the healthcare staff necessary for nebulizer administration (eg, respiratory therapists or nurse) should be in the room for the initiation of the procedure and airborne precautions similar to those for intubation should be taken. (See 'The decision to intubate' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Investigational COVID-19 agents — Several investigational agents have been proposed and individual institutions should work with their pharmacists and clinical researchers to enroll patients in clinical trials. We suggest the development of protocols by individual ICUs for the off-label use of investigational agents. This area is rapidly evolving and is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Management of co-infections and comorbidities — Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are intubated are at risk for developing VAP and other infections typical of all critically ill and/or intubated patients (eg, central line or urinary tract infections). When treating co-infections, potential drug interactions with any investigational COVID-19 agent should be assessed. Infectious disease experts should be involved early in the management of COVID-19 patients who are critically ill. Further details regarding management of chronic medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and angiotensin receptor inhibitors are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Managing chronic medications'.)SPECIAL POPULATIONS — There are no specific recommendations for pregnant women who are critically-ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. Management should be similar to uninfected patients. Issues regarding transmission and risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women is described separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Pregnant and breastfeeding women' and ""Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period"" and ""Acute respiratory failure during pregnancy and the peripartum period"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".) In patients with sickle cell disease who are critically-ill with COVID-19 in whom acute chest syndrome is contributing to their illness, consideration of early exchange transfusions and surveillance for the development of acute pulmonary hypertension is prudent [70]. (See ""Acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease"", section on 'COVID-19'.)Issues that arise for other populations are provided in the following links:●Renal issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"")●Cardiac issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"")●Airway management and operating room issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"")●Cancer care (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"")PROGNOSIS — Early data are emerging describing outcomes from COVID-19 in critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2,8-10,21,22,24-26]. Mortality appears lower than that in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The mortality from COVID-19 appears driven by the presence of severe ARDS, and is approximately 50 percent (range 16 to 78 percent).●In a single-center retrospective cohort of 52 critically ill Chinese patients with COVID-19, 62 percent had died by 28 days with a median duration of only seven days from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to death [9]. Among the 20 patients who survived, three remained on mechanical ventilation, three were receiving noninvasive mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC), and six were receiving low flow oxygen. ●In a retrospective cohort of 201 Chinese patients with COVID-19, the mortality was 52 percent among those who developed ARDS [25]. Among those who received mechanical ventilation, 66 percent died, 21 percent were discharged and 13 percent remained hospitalized. ●In a preliminary study of 21 critically ill patients in the United States, by day 5, 67 percent of critically ill patients had died, 24 percent remained critically ill, and 9.5 percent were discharged from the ICU [19]. ●In an Italian cohort of 1591 patients, the ICU morality was 26 percent, but a significant proportion remained in the ICU at the time of the publication, which may have underestimated the true mortality [22]. Higher mortality was initially reported in males compared with females but this may have been due to the predominance of males affected with COVID-19 in the Chinese cohorts [8-10,25,26]; a similar difference has been noted in the preliminary reports from Italy but not from Washington state, USA [18,19]. Across countries, the consistent major risk factor associated with death in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is older age [9,10,17,20,22,24,25]. In two Chinese retrospective cohorts, death from ARDS was more likely to occur in those of older age ≥64 years (hazard ratio [HR] 6.17; 95% 3.26-11.67) [9,25]. Preliminary reports from Italy and the United States are reporting similar outcomes [17,18,20]. Other risk factors associated with death among critically ill patients include the following [9,10,17,20,22,24,25,55]:●The development of ARDS, particularly severe ARDS, and the need for mechanical ventilation●Comorbidities (eg, chronic cardiac and pulmonary conditions, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease)●Markers of inflammation or coagulation (eg, D-dimer level >1 microg/mL admission, elevated fibrin degradation products, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times)●Select laboratory studies (eg, worsening lymphopenia, neutrophilia)The rapidity of symptom progression does not appear to predict a worse outcome [9]While high fever was associated with a higher likelihood of developing ARDS (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.11-2.84), it appears to be associated with a lower likelihood of death (HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21-0.82) [9,25], a phenomenon that has been noted previously in some critically ill patients. (See ""Fever in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Outcomes'.) Further details on the risk factors associated with severe disease are provided separately. (See 'Risk factors for progression' above.)END OF LIFE ISSUES — In a public health emergency, values other than autonomy predominate. Like any critical illness, severe illness due to COVID-19 carries the potential of significant psychosocial distress to patients, families, and surrogates. In addition, unique aspects of COVID-19 and its management portend greater trauma including anxiety and stigma surrounding a novel pathogen and high-level isolation precautions including visitation limitation or prohibition including at the end of life. High levels of patient, family, and surrogate psychosocial distress should be anticipated and combatted with clear communication strategies and early palliative care involvement. Even if in-person visitation is not allowed due to public health care concerns, hospitals should promote internet based visual communication such as video communication between clinicians, families, and isolated patients.   Discussing end-of-life wishes with patients and their family should occur early in the course of management, including potentially even before diagnosis, especially in light of the poor outcomes for elderly patients with comorbidities who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require mechanical ventilation. Consultation with the palliative care teams and ethic experts should also be done to assist families in decision-making and assist clinicians with contentious issues or disagreement that may arise. Due to the unique aspects to addressing needs of patient and families in this pandemic, several online resources are available for clinicians to use when having COVID-19 specific discussions with patients and families. They provide helpful language and strategies for conversations about a range of issues including, but not limited to, triaging, discussing goals of care, resource allocation, and grieving including:●VIITALtalk ●Center to Advance Palliative Care ●National Coalition for Hospice an Palliative Care Further principles regarding ethical issues in the intensive care unit (ICU) and advance care planning are discussed separately. (See ""Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults"" and ""Ethics in the intensive care unit: Informed consent"" and ""Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit"" and ""Communication in the ICU: Holding a family meeting"" and ""Palliative care: Issues in the intensive care unit in adults"" and ""Advance care planning and advance directives"", section on 'COVID-19 resources'.)SURGE CAPACITY AND SCARCE RESOURCE ALLOCATION — COVID-19 is a global pandemic and has placed significant increases in demand for acute and critical care services on hospitals in many regions. This has necessitated operations maneuvers to increase capacity to be able to provide care for more patients, for more higher acuity patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation, and for patients with special isolation requirements. Surge capacity may be achieved by maximizing resources across three domains: ●Care spaces (ie, beds)●Staff●Physical equipmentIn the COVID-19 pandemic, this has included expanding ICU care into non-ICU spaces, utilizing non-critical care trained staff to participate in delivering critical care, and innovative approaches to obtain, conserve, and increase the efficiency of physical equipment including personal protective equipment (PPE; eg, repeat use of N95 masks) and mechanical ventilators (eg, double ventilation, repurposing operating room ventilators). As an example, some experts have published preliminary data to highlight the use of one ventilator for use in multiple patients [71]. However, this maneuver was designed for a disaster setting where one might reasonably expect that several patients might need life support at similar levels. Use of this measure as a life-saving measure in patients with COVID-19 could be complicated if patients are not matched well in terms of their ventilator settings. Potential use of anesthesia ventilators for longer-term mechanical ventilation is provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines"".)In some instances, such as in Italy, despite mobilizing to surge capacity, demand for care has still outpaced supply such that overt rationing has occurred [72]. All hospitals facing the potential of an acute surge event due to COVID-19 or another insult should have a process to approach the allocation of scarce resources such as ICU beds and mechanical ventilators. Most individual states in the United States have guidance documents which can be adapted for local institutions [73]. General principles that guide and underpin scarce resource allocation policies include: ●Maximization of lives saved and/or life-years saved●Transparency ●Stakeholder and public input●Separation between the clinical team and the triage process (eg, ethics committees for difficult triage decisions)●Robust palliative care and supportive measures for patients who are not provided with critical care resourcesSOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), up to one-quarter require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. (See 'Introduction' above and 'Epidemiology' above.)●Profound hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the dominant finding in critically ill patients. Common complications include acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated liver enzymes, and the late development of cardiac injury, including sudden cardiac death. Sepsis, shock, and multi-organ failure are less common. (See 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' above.) ●For most critically ill patients with COVID-19, we prefer the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting a peripheral oxygen saturation between 90 and 96 percent. (See 'Respiratory care of the nonintubated patient' above and 'Oxygenation targets' above and 'Low flow oxygen' above.)•The use of high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is controversial based on infection control concerns and the frequent need for mechanical ventilation despite these measures. The decision to initiate noninvasive modalities requires balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of resources; this approach should be reassessed as new data becomes available. (See 'Patients with higher oxygen requirements' above.) •In patients with COVID-19 who have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and higher oxygen needs than low flow oxygen can provide, we suggest selective use of noninvasive measures rather than routinely proceeding directly to intubation (Grade 2C). As an example we might trial HFNC in younger patients without comorbidities who can tolerate nasal cannulae. In contrast, we may proceed directly to early intubation in patients at higher risk (eg, elderly patients and patients with comorbidities or risk factors for progression). •Among the noninvasive modalities we suggest HFNC rather than NIV (Grade 2C). Our preference for HFNC is based upon limited and inconsistent data, which, on balance, favors HFNC compared with NIV in HFNC in patients with non-COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. NIV via a full face mask (with a good seal) may be appropriate in patients with indications that have proven efficacy including acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and sleep disordered breathing. (See ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure' and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'.).•For patients with COVID-19 who receive HFNC or NIV, vigilant monitoring is warranted for progression with frequent clinical and arterial blood gas evaluation every one to two hours to ensure efficacy and safe ventilation. The threshold to intubate such patients should be low. ●For critically ill patients with COVID-19, intubation should not be delayed until the patient acutely decompensates since this is potentially harmful to both the patient and healthcare workers. We have a low threshold to intubate those who have (see 'Timing' above):•Rapid progression over a few hours•Failure to improve despite HFNC >40 L/min and FiO2 >0.6•Development of hypercapnia•Hemodynamic instability or multiorgan failure ●Intubation is a high risk procedure for aerosol dispersion in patients with COVID-19 and attention should be paid to donning full personal protective equipment (PPE) with airborne precautions (figure 2 and figure 3) as well using equipment that minimizes dispersion (eg, video laryngoscopy) and the development of protocols for the procedure (eg, check lists) (table 2 and figure 1). (See 'Precautions' above and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)●We use low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) (range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW (table 3 and table 4)) that targets a plateau pressure ≤30 cm H2O and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table (table 5). For patients with COVID-19 who fail LTVV, prone ventilation is the preferred next step (table 7 and table 6). (See 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome' above and ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".) ●Several procedures, including the collection of respiratory specimens, bronchoscopy, extubation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are aerosol-generating and should be avoided or minimized, if possible. All procedures should be grouped when possible. (See 'Interventions' above.)●Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are mechanically ventilated for ARDS should receive the usual daily surveillance, and supportive care including conservative fluid management (unless patients have sepsis or volume depletion) (table 1). Measurement of surveillance cardiac troponins and a low threshold to perform transthoracic echocardiography is appropriate for the early detection of cardiac injury. (See 'Supportive care' above and 'Surveillance' above.) •In critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS who do not have a specific indication (eg, acute bronchospasm or refractory septic shock), we suggest not administering glucocorticoids (Grade 2C). The rationale for not administering glucocorticoids in this population is that the data supporting any benefit in the non-COVD-19 population did not include a sufficient proportion of patients with viral pneumonia to inform safety and that data in patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], influenza) suggested harm. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'.) •For acute bronchodilation, we prefer the use of in-line metered dose inhalers (MDIs) rather than administration via a standard jet or vibrating mesh nebulizer due to the lower risk of aerosolization associated with MDIs. Individual institutions should work with their pharmacy regarding compassionate use of investigational medications and trial enrollment. We suggest the development of protocols by individual ICUs for the off-label use of investigational agents. (See 'Nebulized medication' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)●For patients with COVID-19 who develop ARDS, the prognosis is poor with mortality ranging from 52 to 67 percent. The highest rates of death occur in those ≥64 years. (See 'Prognosis' above.)●A greater level of anxiety and trauma among patients and families should be anticipated and combatted with clear communication strategies and early palliative care involvement. (See 'End of life issues' above.)●Several measures should be adopted to accommodate a surge in COVID-19 cases including included expanding ICU care into non-ICU spaces, utilizing non-critical care trained staff to participate in delivering critical care, and innovative approaches to obtain, conserve, and increase the efficiency of physical equipment (eg, personal protective equipment and mechanical ventilators).

ID:127535,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues,"INTRODUCTION — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Information about COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, and interim guidance by multiple organizations is constantly being updated and expanded. This topic will discuss issues related to COVID-19 during pregnancy and delivery.VIROLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY — General issues regarding the virology, geographic distribution, route of transmission, period of infectivity, and immunity of SARS-CoV-2 are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)Vertical transmission is addressed below. (See 'Vertical transmission' below.)PREVENTION — Pregnant women should follow the same recommendations as nonpregnant persons for avoiding exposure to the virus (eg, social distancing, hand hygiene, disinfecting surfaces). Women with epidemiologic history of contact should be monitored. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.)Pregnant women with children should exercise caution. COVID-19 in children is usually mild and may be asymptomatic, although severe cases have been reported. Given the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or presymptomatic individuals within the incubation period) [1-7], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that children not have playdates with children from other households; that they remain ≥6 feet from people from other households when playing outside; and that they wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain [8]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Should play dates and playgrounds be avoided?'.) Pregnant health care workers have additional concerns, and there is no standard occupational guidance for them. Some human resources units suggest that those in the third trimester, particularly ≥36 weeks, stop face-to-face contact with patients to help reduce their risk of acquiring infection and its consequences. More commonly, they give pregnant health care workers the option of reassignment or limiting their exposure to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures). The International Society of Infectious Disease in Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests that pregnant women working in high-risk exposure settings (eg, labor and delivery, operating room, respiratory wards, intensive care or high dependency units) transfer to low-risk exposure settings, especially if they are >24 weeks of gestation [9].CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS — All pregnant women should be monitored for development of symptoms and signs of COVID-19, particularly if they have had close contact with a confirmed case or persons under investigation. In a systematic review including 356 cases in pregnant women (33 studies), the most frequent symptoms were fever (67 percent), cough (66 percent), dyspnea (7 percent), sore throat (7 percent), fatigue (7 percent), and myalgia (6 percent) [10]. Rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, headache, and possibly abnormalities in smell and/or taste have also been reported. Laboratory findings included lymphopenia (14 percent), modest increase in liver enzymes (5 percent), and thrombocytopenia (1 percent) [10]. These clinical manifestations are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)Complications of infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shock. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)Classification of disease severity — In the United States, the National Institutes of Health have categorized disease severity as [11]:●Asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection – Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 but no symptoms.●Mild illness – Any signs and symptoms (eg, fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain) without shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging.●Moderate illness – Evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) >93 percent on room air at sea level.●Severe illness – Respiratory frequency >30 breaths per minute, SaO2 ≤93 percent on room air at sea level, ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300, or lung infiltrates >50 percent.●Critical illness – Respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.Disease severity has also been categorized as (Wu classification) [12]:●Mild – No or mild symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough, and/or less common features of COVID-19).●Severe – Tachypnea (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute), hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤93 percent on room air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg), or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging).●Critical (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Defining disease severity'.)COURSE IN PREGNANCY — Available data from multiple small series suggest that pregnancy and childbirth do not increase the risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, do not worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 compared with nonpregnant individuals of the same age, and most infected mothers recover without undergoing delivery [12-25]. The patient group most commonly affected by severe disease includes older adults (>60 years), particularly with comorbidities, and most pregnant women are younger than middle age; however, they may have comorbid conditions that increase their risk (eg, hypertension, diabetes, severe obesity, severe asthma, serious heart disease, immunocompromise). It is known that some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response (similar to cytokine release syndrome), which has been associated with critical and fatal illnesses. Whether the normal immunologic changes of pregnancy affect the occurrence and course of this response is unknown. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications'.)In pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia, early data show approximately the same rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions as in the nonpregnant population but an increased risk of preterm and cesarean delivery. (See 'Pregnancy complications' below.)●A preliminary report from the United States indicated 4 of 143 pregnant COVID-19 patients (2.8 percent) were admitted to an ICU, but these data were incomplete [26]. ●In an initial United States experience from New York City including 43 pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19, the disease course was mild in 37 (86 percent), severe in 4 (9.3 percent), and critical in 2 (4.7 percent) [14]. ●In a larger cohort of 147 pregnant patients in the WHO-China Joint Mission Report and a separate report of 118 pregnant patients in Wuhan, 8 percent were severely ill, and 1 percent were critically ill [17]. These percentages are similar to those of nonpregnant, reproductive-age adults [12,27]. Severe sequelae of maternal infection include prolonged ventilatory support and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [28].A single maternal death from multiorgan failure has been reported in the medical literature [29], and several anecdotal reports exist [30].It is important to note that in one report from New York City, 10 of 14 patients who were asymptomatic on admission for an obstetric indication and found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive on universal screening went on to develop symptoms during their delivery admission or postpartum [14]. Of the 14 initially asymptomatic patients, 4 remained asymptomatic, 8 developed mild symptoms, and 2 developed severe/critical disease.While the course of the infection in pregnant persons is similar to that in nonpregnant persons, there are added issues during pregnancy, such as timing of prenatal care visits and screening tests in uninfected women and, in infected women, potential pregnancy complications, timing and management of labor and delivery, and postpartum care (mother-newborn separation, breastfeeding, infant care, postpartum depression risk). These issues are reviewed below.Pregnancy complications — Although an early review of 51 pregnant patients with well-documented COVID-19 reported that 39 percent delivered before 37 weeks of gestation and 96 percent delivered by cesarean [24], a subsequent larger systematic review including 252 pregnant COVID-19 patients reported that 15 percent delivered before 37 weeks and 70 percent were delivered by cesarean [10]. It is important to emphasize that available data are generally of low quality, reflecting small numbers of cases and a disproportionate number of patients intubated with COVID-19 pneumonia. Fever and hypoxemia from severe pneumonia may increase the risks for preterm labor, prelabor rupture of membranes, and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. It appears that many of the initial third-trimester cases were electively delivered by cesarean because of a bias to intervene catalyzed by the belief that management of severe maternal respiratory disease would be improved by delivery; however, this hypothesis is unproven.The frequency of spontaneous abortion may not be increased, but data on first-trimester infections are limited [10,31]. Two critically ill women had fetal deaths; one of these women died, and the other was on ECMO [28,29]. Over 95 percent of newborns have been in good condition at birth; neonatal complications have largely been related to preterm birth [10].Hyperthermia, which is common in COVID-19, is a theoretical concern as elevation of maternal core temperature from a febrile illness during organogenesis in the first trimester may be associated with an increased risk of congenital anomalies, especially neural tube defects, or miscarriage; however, an increased incidence of these outcomes has not been observed. Use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, including in the first trimester, has been shown overall to be safe and may attenuate the pregnancy risks associated with fever exposure. (See ""Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management"", section on 'Fever/hyperthermia'.)Vertical transmission — The criteria that should be used for definitive diagnosis of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are unclear. One suggestion is a neonatal nasopharyngeal swab positive for virus within one to two hours of birth and before contact with an infected individual, and an elevated immunoglobulin M (IgM) level for the virus in cord blood.To date, SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in cord blood or amniotic fluid. There is at least one case report of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 who had second-trimester miscarriage in which samples taken from a placental cotyledon and submembrane were positive for SARS-CoV-2; all fetal, amniotic fluid, cord blood, and maternal blood and vaginal samples were negative [32]. In addition, maternal infection has been associated with focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels in the chorionic plate and stem villi, which has been attributed to systemic procoagulant effects [33].In reviews including up to 51 pregnant women with COVID-19, no cases of intrauterine transmission have been documented [20,24,25]. Subsequently, several possible cases based on newborn laboratory and/or clinical findings have been reported [21,34-37], but SARS-CoV-2 testing on fetal blood, amniotic fluid, and placenta was either negative or not performed. Many of these infants were delivered by cesarean and had positive nasopharyngeal cultures for SARS-CoV-2 on days 1 or 2 of life, an elevated IgM level, and/or pneumonia. Positive IgM results are not definitive evidence of in utero infection, and, in many of these cases, early infant infection may have been due to postnatal contact with infected parents or caregivers [38].APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS — The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered in patients with new-onset fever/chills and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea). It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Residing in or travel to a location where there is community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the past 14 days should heighten suspicion.Patients who meet the testing criteria should undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen, ideally in addition to testing for other respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus). Criteria for testing and diagnostic issues are discussed in detail separately (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'). This testing should occur in a location designed to reduce the risk of passing the infection to uninfected persons, such as at dedicated ""walk-in"" or ""drive-in"" testing locations from which results can be made readily available to the obstetric providers. A positive RT-PCR generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although false-positive tests are possible. False-negative tests on initial testing appear to be common (approximately one in four tests [9]) and have been reported in pregnant women [39]. However, sensitivity depends on the precise RT-PCR assay, the type of specimen obtained (nasopharyngeal specimens have higher sensitivity than oropharyngeal or nasal specimens), the quality of the specimen, and duration of illness at the time of testing. If the initial nasopharyngeal test is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, the test should be repeated in 24 hours to a few days. Infection control precautions for COVID-19 should continue while repeat evaluation is being performed. Two subsequent negative samples generally rule out the infection [9]. If there is high suspicion of COVID-19 infection and diagnosis is required for management, lower respiratory tract specimens (eg, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) can be tested as they have higher sensitivity [40]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings'.)A chest radiograph is sufficient for initial evaluation of pulmonary complications in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A single chest radiograph carries a very low fetal radiation dose of 0.0005 to 0.01 mGy. Computed tomography (CT) should be performed, if indicated, as the fetal radiation dose for a routine chest CT (table 1) is also low and not associated with an increased risk of fetal anomalies or pregnancy loss. Some authorities have advocated pulmonary ultrasound for quick diagnosis of pneumonia in pregnant women, which in certain locations would be the quickest way to ascertain high suspicion of maternal COVID-19 infection [41,42]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Evaluation' and ""Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and nursing women"".)PRENATAL CAREPreventing exposure in the community — Social distancing and hygienic measures are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.)Patients with potential exposure — Pregnant patients with an epidemiologic history of contact with a person with confirmed, probable, or suspected COVID-19 should self-isolate and be monitored for symptoms. The incubation period is up to 14 days. Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on test availability. If testing is performed, those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic can discontinue isolation seven days after the date of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 test [11]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Managing asymptomatic individuals with potential exposure'.)Further evaluation and management of patients who become symptomatic depend on illness severity, underlying comorbidities, and clinical status. Those with at least moderate illness are typically hospitalized. (See 'Classification of disease severity' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)Routine prenatal care in asymptomatic women — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine have issued guidance regarding prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic (available at acog.org and SMFM.org) [43,44]. It includes general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19, algorithms, and suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits. These modifications, which should be tailored for low- versus high-risk patients (eg, multiple gestation, hypertension, diabetes), include telehealth, reducing the number of in-person visits, timing of visits, grouping tests (eg, aneuploidy, diabetes, infection screening) to minimize maternal contact with others, restricting visitors during visits and tests, timing of indicated obstetric ultrasound examinations (eg, gestational age, fetal anomaly, fetal growth, placental attachment), and timing and frequency of use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles. There are many ways to reduce the time patients, including patients with high-risk pregnancies, are in the office [45]. For example, the clinician can order a 75 gram two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) instead of a glucose challenge test and 100 gram three-hour GTT (in women with positive results); cell-free DNA screening can be used (at >10 weeks) for Down syndrome screening rather than the combined test (ie, nuchal translucency on ultrasound and serum analytes). Ideally, every woman should have telehealth capabilities and a means for measuring blood pressure at home. In the author's practice, during the pandemic, most low-risk pregnant women come to the office only for in-person prenatal visits at approximately 12, 20, 28, and 36 weeks of gestation (ie, at gestational ages when ultrasound and/or laboratory tests can also be performed) to minimize person-to-person contacts. Some practices are encouraging that even these visits occur by telehealth, and others include a visit at approximately 32 weeks [9]. When an outpatient office visit occurs, all patients and health care workers wear at least a surgical mask; no partner is allowed, but video communication is encouraged.The psychological impact of COVID-19 should also be recognized and support offered. In one study, approximately one-third of respondents reported moderate to severe anxiety [46].Medical management of pregnant women with COVID-19Home care — Most pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19 have mild disease (no shortness of breath) that does not warrant hospital-level care in the absence of obstetric problems (eg, preterm labor). Patient instructions and other aspects of home care are similar to that in nonpregnant persons, except pregnant women in the third trimester should perform fetal kick counts and report decreased fetal movement [9]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting' and ""Decreased fetal movement: Diagnosis, evaluation, and management"".) The US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its approval for use of noninvasive fetal and maternal monitoring devices in the home in patients who require fetal and/or maternal monitoring for conditions unrelated to COVID-19 [47]. This can help reduce patient and health care provider contact and potential exposure to COVID-19 during the pandemic.Hospitalized patients — Pregnant women with mild disease plus comorbidities or moderate to critical disease are hospitalized. Pregnant hospitalized patients with severe disease, an oxygen requirement plus comorbidities, or critical disease should be cared for by a multispecialty team [9]. (See 'Classification of disease severity' above.)Guidelines for management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, including evaluation and care of critically ill patients, are reviewed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)Additional issues in pregnant women include:●Fetal monitoring – A specific management issue in pregnant patients is fetal monitoring in those who are at a viable gestational age. The need for and frequency of fetal testing depend upon gestational age, stability of maternal vital signs, other maternal comorbidities, and discussions with the patient and her family that consider the possibly increased risks of stillbirth and perinatal morbidities in the absence of testing as well as the possible risks from increased contact with health care personnel performing this testing. For hospitalized patients, a Bluetooth-enabled external fetal monitor can transmit the fetal heart rate tracing to the obstetric provider. The monitor can be used continuously in unstable hospitalized patients in whom cesarean delivery would be performed for a persistent nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. An abnormal tracing might also help guide maternal oxygen therapy. In patients with stable oxygen saturation (SaO2), a nonstress test can be performed twice daily, as one option. ●Monitoring for preterm labor – Monitoring pregnant patients for signs and symptoms of preterm labor is a routine component of obstetric care and should be a component of maternal monitoring of pregnant patients hospitalized in nonobstetric settings. (See ""Preterm labor: Clinical findings, diagnostic evaluation, and initial treatment"".)●Maternal oxygenation level – Among critically ill COVID-19 patients, profound acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the dominant finding. General supportive care of the critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is similar to that in patients with ARDS due to other causes. Common complications of COVID-19-related ARDS include acute kidney injury, elevated liver enzymes, and cardiac injury (eg, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death). During pregnancy, maternal peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) should be maintained at ≥95 percent, which is in excess of the oxygen delivery needs of the mother. If SpO2 falls below 95 percent, an arterial blood gas is obtained to measure the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): Maternal PaO2 greater than 70 mmHg is desirable to maintain a favorable oxygen diffusion gradient from the maternal to the fetal side of the placenta.In the intensive care unit (ICU), severely ill patients with COVID-19 are often managed in the prone position. Some ICUs have extended this approach to pregnant women, although even a semi-prone position can be a difficult position in which to place a pregnant woman in the last half of pregnancy. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"" and ""Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period"", section on 'Supportive care' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●Use and type of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis – Direct data on thromboembolic risk with COVID-19 are limited but suggest an increased risk. The American Society of Hematology, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, and the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis [48-50] recommend routine pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 unless there is a contraindication (eg, bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia). We initiate prophylaxis in all pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital for management of an antepartum obstetric or medical disorder and all postpartum women with the infection. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)Unfractionated heparin is generally preferred in pregnant women who might be proximate to delivery because it is more readily reversed than low molecular weight heparin. Low molecular weight heparin is reasonable in women unlikely to be delivered within several days and those who are postpartum. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)●Safety of antiviral drug therapy – Several agents are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Although some of these agents are clinically available for other indications (eg, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine), their use for COVID-19 remains investigational. At some hospitals, pregnant women with severe COVID-19 are being offered remdesivir in a compassionate-use protocol.•Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [51] and related coronaviruses (including severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) both in vitro and in animal studies [52]. It has been used without reported fetal toxicity in some pregnant women with Ebola and Marburg virus disease [53] and is being used to treat, on a compassionate-use basis, pregnant patients with severe COVID-19. Randomized trials of the drug during the COVID-19 pandemic have excluded pregnant and breastfeeding women.•Both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, but data from early randomized trials generally do not suggest a benefit. Hydroxychloroquine crosses the placenta. Accumulation in fetal ocular tissues has been observed in animal studies, but fetal ocular toxicity has not been observed in humans, which is reassuring given that the drug has been widely used by pregnant women for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus or for prevention of malaria. Adverse maternal effects include abnormal heart rhythms (QT interval prolongation and ventricular tachycardia). (See ""Malaria in pregnancy: Prevention and treatment"", section on 'Safety of antimalarials in pregnancy' and ""Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus"", section on 'Medications'.)Several other drugs are being used in research studies. One such drug is lopinavir-ritonavir, which is primarily used for treatment of HIV infection, including during pregnancy. It crosses the placenta and may increase the risk for preterm delivery, but an increased risk of teratogenic effects has not been observed in humans. Investigational drugs for COVID-19 that are known to be teratogenic include ribavirin and baricitinib. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications●Antenatal betamethasone – For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because they have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with MERS-CoV infection. However, the CDC have not addressed use of antenatal glucocorticoids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from preterm birth in pregnant COVID-19-positive patients.Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at high risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 [54]. However, for pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation and at risk of preterm birth within seven days, the benefits to the neonate are less clear, and ACOG has advised not administering a course of betamethasone to such patients. However, these decisions may need to be individualized, weighing the neonatal benefits with the risks of potential harm to the pregnant patient. (See ""Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery"", section on 'Gestational age at administration'.)●Low-dose aspirin – For pregnant women without COVID-19, ACOG has stated that low-dose aspirin should continue to be offered as medically indicated (eg, prevention of preeclampsia) [55]. For those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for whom low-dose aspirin would be indicated, the decision to continue the drug should be individualized. For example, continuing preeclampsia prophylaxis is likely not worthwhile in severely or critically ill patients or near term. A panel from the National Institutes of Health has stated that persons with COVID-19 who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for a comorbid condition should continue therapy as previously directed by their health care provider [11].Concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [56,57]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients when clinically indicated [58,59]. ●Tocolysis – In women with known or suspected COVID-19, our preferred tocolytic is nifedipine. It is a suitable alterative to indomethacin, which is subject to the concerns discussed above, and to beta sympathomimetics, which can further increase the maternal heart rate. Follow-up of women who recover from COVID-19 — An ultrasound to assess fetal growth is reasonable a few weeks following maternal recovery, especially in patients who had severe illness [9]. Very limited COVID-19-specific data on fetal growth are available [19]. Fetal growth restriction was reported in two of three pregnancies complicated by SARS and delivered five and seven weeks after onset of illness [60]. The placentas showed areas of fetal thrombotic vasculopathy, which may have been caused by SARS-related coagulopathy or placental hypoxia during the acute maternal illness [61].Timing delivery in infected women — For most women with preterm COVID-19 and nonsevere illness who have no medical/obstetric indications for prompt delivery, delivery is not indicated and ideally will occur sometime after a negative testing result is obtained or isolation status is lifted, thereby minimizing the risk of postnatal transmission to the neonate [62].In women with severe illness, there are multiple issues to consider, and timing of delivery needs to be individualized [9,63]. Whether the mother's respiratory disease will be improved by delivery and the risk of postnatal transmission in the delivery room when maternal symptoms are acute are both unclear. It should also be noted that maternal antibody production and, in turn, passive newborn immunity may not have had time to develop. On the other hand, increased oxygen consumption and reduced functional residual capacity, which are normal in pregnancy, may facilitate maternal deterioration in patients with pneumonia [64]. Excessive uterine distension from multiple gestation or severe polyhydramnios in the third trimester may further compromise pulmonary function.For the hospitalized patient with COVID-19 with pneumonia but not intubated, some authorities have advocated consideration of delivery in pregnancies >32 to 34 weeks. The rationale is that delivery is performed before the pulmonary situation worsens and ongoing maternal hypoxemia places the fetus at risk of compromise. Most authorities do not advocate delivery prior to 32 weeks, even though the maternal situation may worsen in the second week, given the known morbidity and mortality of very preterm infants.Timing of delivery of the hospitalized pregnant woman intubated and critically ill with COVID-19 is challenging. After 32 to 34 weeks, some have advocated delivery if the patient is stable, but this could exacerbate the maternal condition. Between viability and <32 weeks, continuing maternal support with fetal monitoring is usually suggested for perinatal benefit as long as the maternal situation remains stable or improving. In some situations, maternal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be necessary [65]. MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND DELIVERY — Although many asymptomatic patients are concerned about leaving their home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) continues to recommend following existing evidence-based guidance regarding home birth [55]. (See ""Planned home birth"".)Infection control precautions●Prehospital notification of possible infection – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that pregnant patients who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 notify the obstetric unit before arrival so that the facility can make appropriate infection control preparations [66]. The obstetric unit should ensure that their infection control practices for these patients are consistent with CDC guidelines. ●Evaluation of all patients presenting to the hospital – All patients should be screened for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as whether they have had close contact with a confirmed case or persons under investigation, before entering the hospital for admission to the labor and delivery unit [67]. Screening can include checking temperature and asking about fever and/or new cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle aches, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, and smell and taste abnormalities. The CDC advise prioritizing the testing of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 at admission or who develop symptoms of COVID-19 during admission [66]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)Asymptomatic patients and presymptomatic patients may present to the labor and delivery unit, which has implications for the health care staff and management of the newborn. For this reason, testing all patients upon presentation may be appropriate. The author's hospital and others in areas with a high rate of infection have begun using a rapid SARS-CoV-2 test on all patients admitted to the labor and delivery unit [22]. We believe this information is useful to inform infection control precautions both intrapartum and postpartum, including newborn care [14,68,69]. During the New York City pandemic, 215 pregnant women admitted to two New York City hospitals for delivery were screened for COVID-19, and 33 (15 percent) were SARS-CoV-2-positive [22]. Of the 33 women, 4 (12 percent) were symptomatic and 29 (88 percent) were asymptomatic on admission. Among the 29 asymptomatic women who tested positive, 3 developed a postpartum fever, and at least 1 of these patients was presumed to have COVID-19. One additional patient who tested negative on admission became symptomatic postpartum, and repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing was positive.The evaluation and diagnosis of women admitted to labor and delivery with suspected COVID-19 are similar to that of other patients admitted to the hospital with suspected disease. The CDC advise prioritizing the testing of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 at admission or who develop symptoms of COVID-19 during admission [66]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)●Use of personal protective equipment on labor and delivery – The author and others recommend that all clinicians with person-to-person contact wear a surgical mask in the health care setting, under the assumption that every patient and health care colleague might be infected with COVID-19 [69]. During active labor in particular, there are concerns of viral dissemination when the patient is forcefully exhaling [70]. To address asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, we also suggest that all asymptomatic patients wear a cloth face covering, at a minimum, consistent with CDC guidance [67]. If a patient arrives to the health care facility without a cloth face covering, a face mask should be used if supplies are available.●Care of COVID-19-positive inpatients – Ideally, pregnant COVID-19 inpatients should be cared for in specially equipped (eg, negative-pressure) rooms in antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum COVID-19-only units, similar to other adult COVID-19 inpatients who are usually placed in dedicated COVID-19-only units, halls, or hospitals. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are normally instructed to wear a face mask, including during labor and delivery, which may be difficult during active pushing [70]. Infection control precautions regarding pregnant patients with confirmed or suspected infection are similar to those for other hospitalized patients and are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●Support persons on labor and delivery – Perhaps the most controversial issue regarding infection control for women in labor and delivery units is whether to allow a support person. Most facilities recognize that a support person is important to many laboring women and permit one support person who must remain with the laboring woman (may not leave her room and then return). The support person should be screened for fever and other symptoms before entering the building and in accordance with hospital policies. Those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. If screening is negative, we require that the support person wear a cloth face covering, at a minimum, consistent with CDC guidance [67]. If the support person arrives at the health care facility without a cloth face covering, a face mask should be issued if supplies are available.A support person who screens positive should not be permitted in the hospital. In such cases and when additional support persons are desired, they can be a part of the patient's labor and delivery via video. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)Route of delivery — COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery [16,43]. Cesarean delivery is performed for standard obstetric indications. Even if vertical transmission is confirmed as additional data are reported, this would not be an indication for cesarean delivery since it would increase maternal risk and would be unlikely to improve newborn outcome. Reports of COVID-19 infection in the neonate have generally described mild disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)Screening patients scheduled for induction or cesarean delivery — Patients should be screened for COVID-19 and can undergo pre-induction/pre-cesarean laboratory testing the day before a planned induction or cesarean delivery. We evaluate symptomatic patients to determine whether it is feasible to reschedule until results of COVID-19 testing are available. This requires balancing the risks of continuing the pregnancy in the setting of a positive or negative test result. In particular, if the result is positive, the patient may become more severely ill over time since symptoms are often more severe in the second week of the illness.In asymptomatic women, inductions of labor and cesarean deliveries with appropriate medical indications should not be postponed or rescheduled; this includes 39-week inductions or cesarean deliveries after patient counseling. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications'.)Analgesia and anesthesia — In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, neuraxial anesthetic is not contraindicated and has several advantages in laboring patients: it provides good analgesia and thus reduces cardiopulmonary stress from pain and anxiety and, in turn, the chance of viral dissemination, and it is available in case an emergency cesarean is required, thus obviating the need for general anesthesia. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology suggests considering suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in these patients because of insufficient data about cleaning, filtering, and potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems [71]. They also urge consideration of limiting use of intravenous, patient-controlled analgesia because of the risk of respiratory depression. General anesthesia (intubation and extubation) is considered an aerosolizing procedure, so special personal protective equipment (ie, N-95 masks, etc) should be worn by all involved health care providers during such a cesarean delivery. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)Magnesium sulfate — In women with respiratory compromise, the use of magnesium sulfate for maternal seizure prophylaxis and/or neonatal neuroprotection should be decided on a case-by-case basis since the drug may further depress respirations. Consultation with maternal-fetal medicine and pulmonary/critical care specialists is advised.Labor management — Generally, management of labor is not altered in women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic or in women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 [70]. Person-to-person contact and time in the labor unit and hospital should be limited, as safely feasible. For patients who require cervical ripening, outpatient mechanical ripening with a balloon catheter is an option. For inpatient cervical ripening, using two methods (eg, mechanical and misoprostol or mechanical and oxytocin) decreases the time from induction to delivery, compared with using one agent only. (See ""Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction"", section on 'Outpatient cervical ripening' and ""Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction"", section on 'Balloon catheter combined with prostaglandins'.)Intake and output of fluids should be carefully monitored, and aggressive hydration should be avoided since it can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen already compromised maternal oxygenation [64]. SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in vaginal secretions or amniotic fluid, so rupture of fetal membranes and internal fetal heart rate monitoring may be performed for usual indications, but data are limited [20]. It should be noted that labor, and particularly pushing, often causes loss of feces, which can contain the virus and spread the infection [72,73].We believe that use of interventions that can increase risk of infection and have not been proven beneficial, for example the use of the birth ball or peanut ball, should be limited. As intrapartum oxygen has no proven fetal benefit, the practice of oxygen therapy for fetal resuscitation should be abandoned; the nasal cannula and face mask used are in contact with the maternal respiratory tract and secretions, so handling of such equipment increases contamination/exposure between patient and provider. Lastly, we advocate not delaying pushing in the second stage, although others have suggested minimizing the duration of active pushing because deep breathing and maternal expulsive efforts may increase exposure to the patient's respiratory secretions [64]. (See ""Intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings: Management"", section on 'In utero resuscitation' and ""Nonpharmacologic approaches to management of labor pain"", section on 'Birth ball' and ""Management of normal labor and delivery"", section on 'Pushing position and technique'.)Delivery procedures — For women with known or suspected infection, ACOG has stated that delayed umbilical cord clamping is highly unlikely to increase the risk of transmitting pathogens from an infected mother to the fetus [43]; however, many institutions have chosen to prohibit this practice in term infants, in whom the benefits are modest, to minimize newborn exposure to any virus in the immediate environment and reduce the chances that the newborn will require phototherapy for jaundice. Many institutions also prohibit skin-to-skin contact in these cases [74], although the World Health Organization has not advised against this [16]. One expert group suggested leaving the vernix caseosa in place for 24 hours after birth since it contains antimicrobial peptides [75]. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises bathing newborns as soon as reasonably possible after birth to remove virus potentially present on skin surfaces [76].Umbilical cord blood banking can be performed if planned; the risk of COVID-19 transmission by blood products has not been documented and is unclear at present [43].Intrapartum and postpartum fever — COVID-19 infection should be part of the differential diagnosis of intrapartum and postpartum fever, particularly when accompanied by respiratory symptoms and reduced oxygenation. Such patients should be tested for the virus, along with evaluation for common causes of intrapartum and postpartum infection (eg, chorioamnionitis, endometritis) [14]. (See ""Intrapartum fever"" and ""Postpartum endometritis"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)POSTPARTUM CAREVenous thromboembolism prophylaxis — Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be considered in all postpartum women with COVID-19, with the decision based on individual risk assessment. For example, we would not administer pharmacologic prophylaxis to women who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and have an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and go home within a few hours.For women who receive postpartum anticoagulation, the optimum duration of therapy is unclear. Some authorities recommend discontinuing prophylaxis upon discharge, and others continue prophylaxis for up to 10 to 14 days [9,64]. Patients at high risk of VTE receive a longer course (eg, six to seven weeks), which depends on the indication for prophylaxis. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"" and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)Maternal monitoring●For patients with known or suspected COVID-19 who are asymptomatic, postpartum maternal monitoring is routine. ●For patients with mild illness (see 'Classification of disease severity' above), we check vital signs and monitor intake and output every 4 hours for 24 hours after vaginal delivery and 48 hours after cesarean delivery. ●For patients with moderate illness, we perform continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for the first 24 hours or until improvement in signs and symptoms, whichever takes longer. The type and frequency of follow-up laboratory studies and chest imaging (initial or repeat) are guided by the patient's course. Several institutional protocols are available. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)●For patients with severe or critical illness, very close maternal monitoring and care on the labor and delivery unit or intensive care unit are indicated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)Infant evaluation — The infants of mothers with COVID-19 are considered COVID-19 suspects, and they should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 [66]. Where testing capacity is available, neonates should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as possible and within the first 24 hours of age using available molecular assays [76]. Repeat testing should be performed at approximately 48 hours of age if the infant is still at the birth facility. Both the throat and nasopharynx should be sampled, but one swab may be used to conserve swabs and polymerase chain reaction testing reagents. A separate rectal swab can be obtained if such testing is available at their center. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)Mother-baby contact — Temporary separation of mothers with known or suspected COVID-19 from their newborns has been proposed to reduce the risk of mother-baby transmission, but may also have adverse consequences [77]. For example, not rooming-in and avoiding skin-to-skin contact can be stressful for mothers; disrupt breastfeeding; and have negative effects on newborn stress, feeding, and bonding.The World Health Organization (WHO) has opined that mothers who have suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 virus infection should be enabled to remain together and practice skin-to-skin contact [16]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise determining whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant on a case-by-case basis, using shared decision making between the mother and the clinical team [66]. Factors to consider include:●The mother's and infant's clinical conditions.●Whether the mother's infection is suspected (no SARS-CoV-2 test result) or confirmed, and the infant's SARS-CoV-2 testing result (separation is not necessary if the infant has a positive test).●The mother's desire to breastfeed.●The facility's ability to accommodate mother-baby separation or colocation.●The mother's ability to maintain separation when she goes home, if she has not met criteria to discontinue temporary separation.●Other risks and benefits of temporary separation of a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant.If mother-baby separation is implemented, the following should be considered:●Infant COVID-19 suspects should be isolated from other healthy infants and cared for according to the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.●If another healthy family member is providing infant care (eg, diapering, bathing, feeding), they should use appropriate personal protective equipment (healthy family members should wear a gown, gloves, face mask, and eye protection).If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, other measures may be utilized to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission and include:●Physical barriers (eg, a curtain between the mother and newborn) can be constructed, and the newborn can be kept ≥6 feet away from the mother.●The mother can wear a face mask and practice hand hygiene when in close contact with her infant, particularly when feeding.●If another healthy adult is in the room, they can care for the newborn.After hospital discharge — After hospital discharge, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises [76]:●A mother with COVID-19 infection should maintain a distance of at least six feet from the newborn and use a face mask and hand hygiene for newborn care until (1) she is afebrile for 72 hours without use of antipyretics, and (2) at least seven days have passed since symptoms first appeared. For discontinuation of home isolation in nonpregnant persons, the CDC also suggest improvement in respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) [78]. ●A mother with COVID-19 infection whose newborn requires ongoing hospital care should maintain separation until (1) she is afebrile for 72 hours without use of antipyretics, and (2) her respiratory symptoms are improved, and (3) at least two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab tests collected ≥24 hours apart are negative. For mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have never been symptomatic, the CDC suggest discontinuing isolation when at least seven days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test [78]. For three days following discontinuation of isolation, they should continue to stay ≥6 feet away from others and wear a mask over their nose and mouth whenever they are in settings where other persons are present.(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk of transmission' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Breastfeeding and formula feeding — It is unknown whether the virus can be transmitted through breast milk. All samples of breast milk from 26 infected women tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 [10]. However, droplet transmission could occur through close contact during breastfeeding. Breastfeeding should be encouraged. In addition to its many other benefits, breast milk is a passive source of antibodies and other anti-infective factors and, thus, may provide passive antibody protection for the infant. (See ""Infant benefits of breastfeeding"" and ""Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding"".)If mother and baby separation has been implemented, ideally, the infant is fed expressed breast milk by another healthy caregiver until the mother has recovered or has been proven uninfected, provided that the other caregiver is healthy and follows hygiene precautions [66]. Expressing breast milk is important to support establishment of the maternal milk supply.Before pumping, ideally with a dedicated breast pump, the mother should wear a mask and thoroughly clean her hands and breasts with soap and water and clean pump parts, bottles, and artificial nipples [79]. The CDC have issued guidance about cleaning breast pumps and breastfeeding. If possible, the pumping equipment should be thoroughly cleaned by a healthy person. If feeding by a healthy caregiver is not possible, mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or symptomatic mothers with suspected COVID-19 should take precautions to prevent transmission to the infant during breastfeeding (wear a mask, hand and breast hygiene, disinfect shared surfaces that the symptomatic mother has contacted). However, it should be noted that the value of precautions, such as cleansing the breast prior to breastfeeding/milk expression or disinfecting external surfaces of milk collection devices (eg, bottles, milk bags) for reducing potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2, has not been formally studied [80].Ideally, women who choose to formula feed should have another healthy caregiver feed the infant. If this is not possible or desired, such women must also take appropriate infection control precautions, as described above, to prevent transmission through close contact when feeding.Analgesia — Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for treatment of postpartum pain. As discussed above, concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs in patients with COVID-19 was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [56,57]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and WHO do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs when clinically indicated [58,59]. Given the uncertainty, we suggest using acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Permanent and reversible contraception — Permanent contraception (tubal sterilization) does not add significant additional time or risk when performed at an uncomplicated cesarean birth and thus should be performed if planned. Permanent contraception after a vaginal birth is more of an elective procedure, so such decisions should be made on a local level, based upon available resources. If not performed or if a reversible contraceptive method is desired, an alternative form of contraception should be provided (eg, immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) as long as the patient desires one of these methods. This avoids additional outpatient postpartum visits. (See ""Overview of female permanent contraception"" and ""Postpartum permanent contraception: Procedures"" and ""Postpartum contraception: Counseling and methods"".)Discharge from hospital — We suggest early discharge postpartum, such as one day after vaginal delivery and a maximum of two days after cesarean delivery, to limit the patient's personal risk in the hospital environment [70].Candidates for mother-infant separation after discharge and criteria for discontinuation of separation are discussed above. (See 'After hospital discharge' above.)Postpartum office visit — Modifying or reducing postpartum outpatient care is appropriate to reduce the risk of inadvertent exposure. For example, it may be possible to perform early postpartum assessments, including wound and blood pressure checks, with telehealth. A comprehensive postpartum visit may still be important by 12 weeks, especially in patients with comorbidities and in patients who lose insurance coverage at that time.All postpartum patients should still be screened for postpartum depression four to eight weeks after delivery. The most widely used instrument is the self-report, 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (figure 1A-B), which can be completed in less than five minutes [81], but alternatives are available. As discussed above, the psychological impact of COVID-19, which may include moderate to severe anxiety, should also be recognized and support offered. (See ""Postpartum unipolar major depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Assessment'.)PREGNANCY REGISTRIES — Registries are being developed to collect data of how COVID-19 affects pregnancy and newborns. For example:●Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY (PRIORITY) is the official United States registry led by the University of California, San Francisco.●International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP) is another registry led by an international group of investigators.SELECTED RESOURCES — In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued guidance regarding prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care during the COVID-19 pandemic [43,82]. This includes general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19 and suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits, obstetric ultrasound examinations, use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles, planned induction or cesarean delivery, and contact with the infant.●American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists COVID-19 information●Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine●World Health Organization●Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:•Pregnancy and Breastfeeding•Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings●International Society of Infectious Disease in Obstetrics and Gynecology Recommendations Concerning COVID-19 and Pregnancy [9].●A dedicated website (www.pregnancycovid19.com) with several helpful pregnancy-specific links and information, including information for patients.PREGNANCY REGISTRY — PRIORITY (Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY) is a nationwide United States study of pregnant or recently pregnant women who are either under investigation or who have been confirmed to have COVID-19 infection.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Pregnant women should follow the same recommendations as nonpregnant persons for avoiding exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We suggest that pregnant health workers in the third trimester, particularly those ≥36 weeks, stop face-to-face contact with patients. (See 'Prevention' above.)●Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant women are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals. A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although false-positive and false-negative tests are possible. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)●Pregnancy does not appear to increase susceptibility to infection or worsen the clinical course, and most infected mothers recover without undergoing delivery. However, severe disease necessitating maternal intensive care unit admission and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can occur. (See 'Course in pregnancy' above.) ●Infected women, especially those who develop pneumonia, appear to have an increased frequency of preterm birth and cesarean delivery. These complications are likely related to severe maternal illness as intrauterine infection does not appear to occur, but this is still under investigation. A few possible early newborn infections and one possible placental infection have been reported. (See 'Pregnancy complications' above and 'Vertical transmission' above.)●The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) have issued guidance regarding prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic (available at acog.org and SMFM.org), including general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19, suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal and postnatal visits and hospital discharge, and algorithms for assessment and management. These modifications are tailored for low- versus high-risk pregnancies. (See 'Prenatal care' above and 'Discharge from hospital' above and 'Postpartum office visit' above.)●For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because of the potential for adverse effects on the course of the disease. Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. (See 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications' above.)●For most women with preterm COVID-19 and nonsevere illness who have no medical/obstetric indications for prompt delivery, delivery is not indicated and ideally will occur sometime after a negative testing result is obtained or isolation status is lifted, thereby minimizing the risk of postnatal transmission to the neonate. Severely ill patients at least 32 to 34 weeks of gestation with COVID-19 pneumonia may benefit from early delivery. (See 'Timing delivery in infected women' above.)●Generally, management of labor is not altered in women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic or in women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in vaginal secretions or amniotic fluid, so rupture of fetal membranes and internal fetal heart rate monitoring may be performed for usual indications, but data are limited. COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery. The partner/support person should be screened in accordance with hospital policies and those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. (See 'Management of labor and delivery' above.)●In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, neuraxial anesthetic is not contraindicated and has several advantages in laboring patients. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology suggests suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in these patients because of insufficient data about potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems. (See 'Analgesia and anesthesia' above.)●At delivery of patients with known or suspected COVID-19, some institutions have chosen to prohibit delayed cord clamping in term infants, in whom the benefits are modest, to minimize newborn exposure to any virus in the immediate environment and reduce the chances that the newborn will require phototherapy for jaundice. (See 'Delivery procedures' above.)●Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for treatment of postpartum pain; however, there are anecdotal reports of possible negative effects of NSAIDs in patients with COVID-19. Given the uncertainty, we use acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used. (See 'Analgesia and anesthesia' above.)●Infants born to mothers with known COVID-19 are COVID-19 suspects and should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See 'Infant evaluation' above.) ●Whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant is determined on a case-by-case basis. If the infant tests positive, separation is unnecessary. If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, other measures may be utilized to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission, including physical barriers and ≥6 feet separation, personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, and utilization of other healthy adults for infant care (feeding, diapering, bathing). (See 'Mother-baby contact' above.)●The virus has not been found in breast milk, but data are limited. Droplet transmission to the newborn could occur through close contact during feeding. In mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or symptomatic mothers with suspected COVID-19, to minimize direct contact, ideally, the infant is fed expressed breast milk by another caregiver until the mother has recovered or been proven uninfected, provided that the other caregiver is healthy and follows hygiene precautions. In such cases, the mother should wear a mask and thoroughly clean her hands and breasts before pumping; the pump parts, bottles, and artificial nipples should be cleaned as well. If she breastfeeds the infant directly, similar personal hygienic precautions should be taken. (See 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding' above.)●Several agents are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir is the most promising and has been used without reported fetal toxicity in some severely ill pregnant women. (See 'Hospitalized patients' above.)",2020-04-30 02:00:00,UPTODATE

ID:127551,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for ""coronavirus disease 2019"" [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Society guideline links'.)This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of arrhythmias and conduction system disease in patients with COVID-19. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of other cardiac presentations (eg, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, etc) and noncardiac symptoms of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere: ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The prevalence of arrhythmias and conduction system disease (and cardiovascular disease in general) in patients with COVID-19 varies from population to population. In 137 subjects from Hubei province, 10 patients (7.3 percent) noted palpitations as one of the initial symptoms [4]. In a study of 138 patients from Wuhan who were hospitalized with COVID-19-related pneumonia, arrhythmias were reported in 17 percent of the general cohort and in 44 percent of patients admitted to an intensive care unit [5]. With both of these reports, the specific cause of palpitations or type of arrhythmia were not specified. Hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities, both known to contribute to the development of acute arrhythmias, have been frequently reported in the acute phase of severe COVID-19 illness; therefore, the exact contribution of COVID-19 infection to the development of arrhythmias in asymptomatic, mildly ill, critically ill, and recovered patients is not known [6]. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSSigns and symptoms — Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. The most common clinical features reported at the onset of illness include fever (99 percent), fatigue (70 percent), dry cough (59 percent), anorexia (40 percent), myalgias (35 percent), dyspnea (31 percent), and sputum production (27 percent) [5]. Noncardiac manifestations of COVID-19 are discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of arrhythmias or conduction system disease. Patients may be tachycardic (with or without palpitations) in the setting of other illness-related symptoms (eg, fever, shortness of breath, pain, etc). The following observations have been reported from various cohorts:●In the cohort from Hubei province, 7.3 percent reported palpitations as a presenting symptom [4,7]. ●Among 4250 patients with COVID-19 from a multicenter New York cohort, 260 (6.1 percent) had QTc >500 milliseconds at the time of admission [8]. However, in another study of 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the baseline QTc was 435 milliseconds before taking these medications [9]. ●Among 393 patients with COVID-19 from a different New York cohort, atrial arrhythmias were more common among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (17.7 versus 1.9 percent) [10].●Among 187 patients with COVID-19 from a Chinese cohort, 11 patients (5.9 percent) had ventricular tachyarrhythmias while hospitalized [11]. ●Epidemiologic data from the Lombardi region of Italy show a nearly 60 percent increase in the rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the peak of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic (when compared with the same time frame from 2019) [12]. This could be related to COVID-19 infections, stress related to the pandemic, or delays in seeking medical attention by those with cardiac symptoms. It does not appear that there was increase in shockable rhythms, even in those who were suspected of or diagnosed with COVID-19. Other patients in whom arrhythmias may be seen include:●Patients who present with other cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection, such as myocardial injury or myocardial ischemia. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".) ●Patients with hypoxia, shock (septic or cardiogenic), or evidence of widespread systemic inflammation [13]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●Patients with electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypokalemia) that predispose to the development of arrhythmias. (See ""Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults"", section on 'Cardiac arrhythmias and ECG abnormalities' and ""Hypomagnesemia: Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion"", section on 'Cardiovascular'.)●Patients who are receiving QT-prolonging therapies and who may develop polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). (See 'Patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes)' below.) ●Patients with fever, which can unmask cases of cardiac channelopathies such as Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome [14,15]. (See 'Brugada syndrome' below and ""Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations"".)Cardiovascular testingECG — Most patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected, and in particular patients with severe disease or in whom QT-prolonging medications will be used, should have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the time of entry into the health care system [16]. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single- or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring or multiple lead positions from a hand-held ECG device may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient [17]. This will allow for documenting baseline QRS-T morphology should the patient develop signs/symptoms suggestive of myocardial injury or an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the baseline ECG allows for documentation of the QT (and corrected QTc) interval. Importantly, QTc will need to be monitored if QT-prolonging therapies are initiated (eg, azithromycin, chloroquine, etc) to reduce the risk of acquired LQTS. (See ""Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"" and 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' below.)Continuous ECG monitoring — In the absence of documented cardiac arrhythmias, suspected myocardial ischemia, or other standard indications, continuous ECG monitoring is not required. However, as part of infection control mechanisms for patients with established or suspected COVID-19 infection, many hospitals are utilizing continuous ECG monitoring (in conjunction with automated blood pressure readings and oxygen saturation monitors) in lieu of standard vital sign checks by nursing staff. This practice reduces the number of clinical staff interacting with the patient, thereby reducing the risk to health care workers and preserving personal protective equipment. Transthoracic echocardiography — While some patients may develop cardiac manifestations, including myocardial injury, an initial transthoracic echocardiogram is not necessary for all patients. Providers may consider using a point-of-care ultrasound for a focused exam. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)DIAGNOSIS OF ARRHYTHMIAS — Arrhythmias are most commonly diagnosed from a combination of vital signs and review of the ECG, ideally a 12-lead ECG, but a rhythm strip can also be used. Tachycardias present with a pulse greater than 100 beats per minute, while most bradyarrhythmias present with a pulse less than 50 to 60 beats per minute. ●The most common arrhythmia overall in patients with COVID-19 is sinus tachycardia, but the most likely pathologic arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and monomorphic or polymorphic VT.●The differentiation between various tachycardias based on regularity (ie, regular or irregular) and QRS width (ie, narrow or wide QRS complex) requires only a surface ECG. (See ""Narrow QRS complex tachycardias: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to the diagnosis"".)●Bradyarrhythmias, including sinus pauses or high-grade heart block with slow escape rhythms, have not typically been seen but can be identified using a surface ECG if present. (See ""Sinus node dysfunction: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II"" and ""Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block"".)The diagnosis of acquired LQTS can be made in a patient with sufficient QT prolongation on the surface ECG in association with a medication or other clinical scenario (ie, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) known to cause QT prolongation. Ideally, the diagnosis is made following review of a full 12-lead ECG, but sometimes a single-lead rhythm strip is adequate if a full 12-lead ECG cannot be obtained. Acquired QT prolongation is typically reversible upon removal of the underlying etiology, such as discontinuation of an offending medication or correction of electrolyte derangements. (See 'Management' below.)Overall, the average QTc in healthy persons after puberty is 420±20 milliseconds. In general, the 99th percentile QTc values are 470 milliseconds in postpubertal males and 480 milliseconds in postpubertal females [18]. A QTc >500 milliseconds is considered highly abnormal for both men and women.MANAGEMENTPatients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes) — All patients with torsades de pointes (TdP) should have an immediate assessment of the symptoms, vital signs, and level of consciousness to determine if they are hemodynamically stable or unstable. Unstable patients — Patients with sustained TdP usually become hemodynamically unstable, severely symptomatic, or pulseless and should be treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms [19], including cardioversion/defibrillation (algorithm 1). Initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, with the exception of intravenous (IV) magnesium, is not indicated for hemodynamically unstable or pulseless patients. A full discussion of the standard approaches to basic life support and advanced cardiac life support is presented separately. (See ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"" and ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"".)Stable patients — Patients with TdP who are hemodynamically stable on presentation may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. As such, therapy should be promptly provided to most patients. A stable patient is one who typically shows no evidence of hemodynamic compromise but may have frequent, repetitive bursts of TdP. This patient should have continuous monitoring and frequent reevaluations due to the potential for rapid deterioration as long as the TdP persists. ●For patients with a single episode of TdP, treatment with IV magnesium along with correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements and/or removal of any inciting medications may be sufficient. The patient should be carefully monitored until electrolytes are normalized and the QT interval nearly normalizes.●For patients with multiple self-terminating episodes of TdP, the same therapies are utilized as in patients with a single episode (ie, IV magnesium, correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements, and/or removal of any inciting medications), along with additional interventions to increase the heart rate, which include overdrive pacing and/or IV isoproterenol infusion.Patients with other arrhythmias — The management of other arrhythmias in the setting of COVID-19 infection is no different from the routine management of these conditions without COVID-19 infection. Please refer to the following topics for management:Atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular tachycardias:●(See ""Overview of the acute management of tachyarrhythmias"".)●(See ""Overview of atrial fibrillation"".)●(See ""Overview of atrial flutter"".)●(See ""Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia"".)●(See ""Treatment of symptomatic arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome"".)●(See ""Focal atrial tachycardia"".) Monomorphic VT:●(See ""Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management"".)●(See ""Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: Treatment and prognosis"".)●(See ""Ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease"".) Conduction system disease:●(See ""Sinus node dysfunction: Treatment"".)●(See ""Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block"".)●(See ""Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II"".)●(See ""Temporary cardiac pacing"".)Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc) — While data are limited, many patients are being treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, which are structurally similar to quinidine and have QT-prolonging effects by blocking activation of the potassium channel IKr (hERG/Kv11.1) [6,20,21]. Other medications with QT-prolonging effects may be tried for COVID-19 (table 1). In addition, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by CYP3A4, so other medications that inhibit this cytochrome could raise plasma levels [20]. Limited data on hydroxychloroquine suggest it has a low risk of causing TdP, based on its use for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and antimalarial therapy [22,23]. There are only in-vitro data suggesting safety of azithromycin and chloroquine on action potential duration alternans [24], with no clinical data on TdP risk. For these medications, their time window of use is short duration, which is another reason the risk of TdP may be lower. However, there can be greater QT-prolonging effects in those with electrolyte abnormalities, those taking other QT-prolonging medications, those with chronic renal insufficiency, and those with congenital long QT syndrome. ●In one study of 84 patients with COVID-19 who were receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, QTc increased from 435 milliseconds to a maximum of 463 milliseconds, peaking between days 3 and 4 [9]. There was a high-risk group of nine patients (11 percent) whose baseline QTc of 447 milliseconds increased to 527 milliseconds. Importantly, no TdP was seen.●In a study of 81 severely ill patients admitted with suspicion of COVID-19 who were all treated with azithromycin and randomized to receive chloroquine at high dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) or low dose (450 mg twice daily for one day, then 450 mg daily for four days), baseline QTc (by Fridericia method) averaged 425 milliseconds and was not significantly different between high- and low-dose patients [25]. QTc increased to >500 milliseconds in 7 of 37 (18.9 percent) high-dose recipients and 4 of 36 (11.1 percent) low-dose recipients. Two high-dose chloroquine recipients developed VT, but no TdP was reported.Monitoring for QT prolongation — The patient's baseline QTc value should be obtained prior to administering any drugs with the potential to prolong the QT interval [26]. The best method to obtain the QT interval is with a 12-lead ECG, but to reduce exposure to staff, this may not always be feasible. A single-lead ECG may underestimate the QT interval, and there should be an attempt to use a multiple-lead telemetry system to monitor the QT interval. There has been some outpatient use of hydroxychloroquine also, but there is no clear guidance regarding how to monitor these patients. Ambulatory ECG monitoring technologies, including the use of mobile or wearable technologies (eg, mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry), have been reported as reliable alternatives when the demand exceeds capacity for standard telemetry monitoring [27]. It is also important for patients being treated with QT-prolonging drugs to report promptly any new symptoms including palpitations, syncope, or near-syncope. They should also report clinical changes that could lead to hypokalemia, such as gastroenteritis or the initiation of diuretic therapy. In general, patients with the following QTc intervals are at low risk for significant QT prolongation and polymorphic VT:●QTc <460 milliseconds in prepubertal males/females●QTc <470 milliseconds in postpubertal males●QTc <480 milliseconds in postpubertal femalesPatients with baseline QTc interval ≥500 milliseconds (with a QRS ≤120 milliseconds) are at increased risk for significant QT prolongation and polymorphic VT [28]. In such patients, efforts should be made to correct any contributing electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and/or hypomagnesemia), with a goal potassium of close to 5 mEq/L. Even in those with a normal QT interval, there should be a review and discontinuation of any QT-prolonging medications that may not be essential to the immediate care of the patient (eg, proton pump inhibitors, etc) (table 1) [29]. In particular, when more than one QT-prolonging agent is being used simultaneously, we recommend one of the following approaches:●One protocol has been published from the Mayo Clinic, using the same QTc cutoffs as above [30]. If two to three hours after a dose of hydroxychloroquine or other QT-prolonging agent, the QTc increases to ≥500 milliseconds or if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds, there should be a reevaluation of the risk of TdP versus benefit of the medication, and the following steps should be taken:•Recognition that there is an increased risk of TdP.•Discontinuation of all other QT-prolonging medications.•Correction of all electrolyte abnormalities.•Place the patient on continuous telemetry, with consideration of a wearable defibrillator or placement of external defibrillator patches.•If TdP develops, then hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin or other medication should be stopped.●Another protocol proposes an ECG at baseline and again at four hours after hydroxychloroquine or other antiviral medication administration only if there is congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, patients are already taking other QT-prolonging medications, or patients have structural heart disease or bradycardia [20]. Another ECG can be completed one to three days later. For most others, an ECG or other QTc interval-monitoring method can be done 24 hours after starting the medication. If the QTc increases to ≥500 milliseconds, if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds, or if ventricular ectopy develops, this protocol recommends cardiology consultation. ●There has been a risk score developed in hospitalized patients for the prediction of QT interval prolongation, though not necessarily for the use of hydroxychloroquine [31,32]. It classifies patients as low, moderate, or high risk for TdP, which may allow for triaging whether continuous telemetry is needed while using the QT-prolonging medication, especially if there are limited resources and the patient could otherwise be followed as an outpatient. Signs of toxicity — There have also been anecdotal reports of toxicity associated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Doses of 5 gm of chloroquine will usually lead to death [33]. Symptoms typically occur in the first hour after ingestion, with seizures or cardiac arrest, as these medications are similar to quinidine, a sodium channel blocker. Cardiovascular toxicities include a widened QRS, prolonged QT interval, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, and hypotension. If ingestion is acute, activated charcoal may be used. In general, treatment involves epinephrine, high-dose diazepam, and repletion of potassium [34]. However, if too much potassium is given, there can be rebound hyperkalemia when there is intracellular shifting out of the cells. A bicarbonate IV infusion may be given, but there should be care in that it may lead to worsening hypokalemia. IV lipid emulsion has also been attempted in limited reports [35]. A local poison control center may be contacted for additional help. Brugada syndrome — Because there is an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of fever in those with Brugada syndrome, aggressive fever reduction with acetaminophen is imperative. High-risk patients, such as those with a spontaneous type 1 pattern ECG and prior syncope, might consider going to an emergency department if they have fever that cannot be promptly lowered with acetaminophen [20]. (See ""Brugada syndrome: Prognosis, management, and approach to screening"", section on 'Treatment'.)PROGNOSIS — Mortality rates appear to increase significantly with increasing age; case fatality rates <1 percent have been reported for those under 50 years of age, with rates approaching 15 percent for patients 80 years of age or older [36]. Similarly, mortality increases with disease severity, as there were no deaths reported among the mild or severe cases in the Chinese cohort, but mortality approached 50 percent among critically ill patients [36]. Underlying medical comorbidities appear to significantly impact COVID-19 severity and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and hypertension have been reported to have significantly high-case fatality rates compared with patients without these underlying comorbidities (10.5 and 6 percent mortality, respectively, compared with 0.9 percent mortality without underlying comorbidities) [36,37].IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PROVIDERS CARING FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS — In addition to providing the best possible care for each patient, infection control to limit transmission is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 [6,38-42].Inpatient care and consultation — The approach to caring for hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 differs slightly, with the intent to reduce exposure to (and spread of) COVID-19 to health care providers. In general, the number of persons interacting directly with the patient and the time spent in the room should be minimized. Social distancing should be maintained, with both the patient and other members of the health care team. The following steps, when possible, will minimize exposure of personnel and limit the use of PPE:●For stable new admissions, the patient should be seen in person by the attending physician and at most one house officer or advanced practitioner (when applicable).●For stable patients on daily rounds, one person on the primary care team should enter the room to conduct the needed physical exam, with the rest of the team participating from outside the room via video chat or telephone.●Routine arrhythmia consultations, particularly in stable patients with ECG evidence documenting a specific arrhythmia or conduction disorder, can be completed without entering the patient's room by reviewing the available records and ECG monitoring data. ●Consider placing all patients on telemetry with concerns of arrhythmias, thereby reducing the need for in-room vital signs.●Utilize rooms with windows in the door to assist with monitoring patients from outside of the room. Patients can be contacted by telephone for routine matters without requiring entry into the room.Arrhythmia-related procedures — In order to maximize the available health care system resources to treat COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, while also minimizing the potential exposure of health care personnel to asymptomatic carriers of the virus, elective and nonurgent procedures should be postponed until a later date. A discussion of the reasoning behind the decision to postpone any procedure should be communicated to the patient and documented in the medical record. Conversely, urgent and semiurgent procedures should be performed when the perceived benefits of the procedure to the patient outweigh the risks of resource utilization and health care personnel exposure. Examples of the types of procedures in each category are as follows [6,38]: Urgent (substantial risk of decompensation, hospitalization, or death if the procedure is delayed):●VT ablation for medically uncontrolled electrical storm in a hemodynamically compromised patient.●Catheter ablation of incessant, hemodynamically significant, severely symptomatic tachycardia (supraventricular VT [SVT]/atrial fibrillation [AF]/atrial flutter) not responding to antiarrhythmic drugs, rate control, and/or cardioversion.●Catheter ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or preexcited AF with syncope or cardiac arrest.●Lead revision for malfunction in a pacemaker-dependent patient or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patient receiving inappropriate therapy.●Generator change in pacemaker-dependent patients who are at elective replacement indicator (ERI) or at device end of life. ●Pacemaker or ICD generator change with minimal battery remaining, depending on specific clinical situations.●Secondary prevention ICD.●Pacemaker implant for complete heart block, Mobitz II atrioventricular (AV) block, or high-grade AV block with symptoms or severe symptomatic sinus node dysfunction with long pauses.●Lead/device extraction for infection, including patients not responding to antibiotics for endocarditis, bacteremia, or pocket infection.●Cardiac resynchronization therapy in the setting of severe refractory heart failure in guideline-indicated patients.●Cardioversion for highly symptomatic atrial arrhythmias or rapid ventricular rates not controlled with medications.●Transesophageal echocardiogram for patients who need urgent cardioversion.Semiurgent (those procedures not deemed urgent but should be performed in a timely manner due to the clinical scenario): ●VT ablation for medically refractory recurrent VT. ●SVT ablation in patients with medically refractory SVT, resulting in emergency department visits. ●Cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) generator replacement for ERI battery status that is not urgent. ●Primary prevention ICD in patients at particularly high risk of life-threating ventricular arrhythmia. Nonurgent (those procedures that may be delayed for weeks or months):●Premature ventricular complex ablation. ●SVT ablation. ●AF and atrial flutter ablation in stable patients without heart failure, not at significant risk of getting hospitalized by delaying the procedure, or at high risk for procedure-related complications due to comorbidities. ●Electrophysiology testing to evaluate stable tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia. ●Primary prevention ICD that is not semiurgent. ●Cardiac resynchronization therapy in stable patients.●CIED upgrade. ●Pacemaker implant for sinus node dysfunction, Mobitz I AV block, other stable non-high-degree AV block, or tachy-brady syndrome in mildly symptomatic patients. ●Pacemaker or ICD generator replacements in patients with >6 weeks of battery remaining. ●Extraction of noninfected devices/leads unless device function is dependent on lead extraction and reimplant. ●Cardioversion for stable arrhythmias with well-tolerated symptoms. ●Left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in patients who can be on anticoagulation.●Transesophageal echocardiogram for routine assessment of valves or LAA closure devices and cardioversions that can be done after appropriate period of anticoagulation.●Implantable loop recorder implants.●Tilt-table testing.Perioperative cardiac implantable electrical device management — For patients with a CIED undergoing surgery or an endoscopic procedure, it is important to know if the patient is pacemaker dependent, if the patient has an ICD with therapies activated, and the likelihood of electromagnetic interference (EMI) during the procedure (eg, due to electrocautery, etc). In a patient with documented or suspected COVID-19 who is undergoing a procedure with a high likelihood of EMI that could result in pacemaker or ICD malfunction, application of a magnet may be used to suspend antitachyarrhythmia therapy in an ICD or to produce asynchronous pacing in a pacemaker [39]. This allows the patient to safely proceed with the necessary procedure without reprogramming the CIED before and after the procedure, thereby reducing the risk to health care personnel and preserving personal protective equipment (PPE).The standard approach to CIED management, which includes in-person reprogramming of the CIED before and after the procedure, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Perioperative management of patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"".)Cardiac implantable electrical device interrogations — For most patients, the majority of CIED follow-up device interrogations on modern-era devices can be done either in person or remotely. To maintain social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend remote CIED interrogations for the vast majority of stable patients [39].Certain situations remain, however, in which an in-person CIED interrogation may be the preferred option, including [6,39]:●Suspected CIED malfunction, including:•Inappropriate pacemaker pacing or sensing noted on ECG or telemetry monitoring.•Failure of ICD to deliver therapy during documented sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia.●Clinically actionable abnormality of CIED or suspicion of the device being at or near end of battery life, noted on remote monitoring, telemetry, or ambulatory monitoring.●ICD shocks, presyncope, or syncope concerning for an arrhythmic event to perform programming changes.●Untreated sustained ventricular arrhythmias in a patient with an ICD.●Evaluation of symptoms suspicious for arrhythmia or abnormal device function in patients who are not enrolled in remote monitoring.●Identified need for reprogramming of the CIED, or ICD patients whose device is delivering auditory or vibratory alerts.●Assessment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a patient with a stroke and no clear documentation of AF on ECG or telemetry monitoring.●For CIED patients requiring urgent or emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, consider performing a computed tomography scan instead if possible (to minimize the need for additional health care provider or device manufacturer representative contact); if not urgent, delay the MRI. ●Patients in the emergency department (or other setting) where remote monitoring is not available. Remote monitoring should be used wherever possible, including the option of asking family to bring the patient's home monitoring equipment to the hospital. After in-person CIED interrogation is performed, it is important to disinfect any parts of the programmer (eg, the programming wand and cord) that have been in contact with the patient. If available, disposable plastic wand coverings may be used to minimize contamination, and consideration should also be given to using a dedicated interrogation device in all settings with known or suspected COVID-19-positive patients. To reduce exposure of health care personnel to CIED patients, a doughnut magnet can be used as an alternative to a complete CIED interrogation or reprogramming [40]. When a hospitalized patient has a pacemaker that does not have remote monitoring capabilities, and proper function of the pacemaker is in question, temporary application of a doughnut magnet over the pacemaker is safe to quickly determine whether or not the pacemaker is capable of delivering pacing stimuli that can capture the heart. Magnet application will place the pacemaker in an asynchronous pacing mode. Depending on the manufacturer and programmed settings, this may include changes in the paced rate, which gives evidence of battery status (ie, elective replacement indicator) or whether there is pacemaker capture. In addition, demonstration of ventricular capture should provide basic reassurance that the pacemaker is functional and can avoid the need for a complete pacemaker interrogation. (See ""Perioperative management of patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"".)Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) — In general, basic life support and advanced cardiac life support for patients with COVID-19 should be administered in standard fashion, similar to patients without COVID-19, with the following exceptions [6,41] (see ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"", section on 'Resuscitation of patients with COVID-19'):●Any personnel caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate PPE before entering the room: gown, gloves, eye protection, and a respirator (eg, an N95 respirator). If supply of respirators is limited, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges that facemasks are an acceptable alternative (in addition to contact precautions and eye protection), but respirators should be worn during aerosol-generating procedures, which includes intubation. The appropriate PPE should all be donned prior to interacting with the patient, even if this leads to a delay in the provision of resuscitative care.●The number of people involved in the resuscitation should be kept to a minimum. This typically includes a team leader, anesthesiologist to manage the airway (if the patient is not already intubated), recorder/scribe, and persons to perform chest compressions, defibrillation, and administration of medications (often, these participants can rotate to allow for periods of rest after performing chest compressions).●In COVID-19 patients who are not yet intubated at the time of cardiac arrest, early intubation should be performed by the provider most likely to achieve success on the first pass, utilizing all readily available technology (eg, video laryngoscopy) to optimize first-pass success. Chest compression can be stopped during intubation, and intubation (with a cuffed endotracheal tube) can be performed prior to the standard two minutes of chest compressions and early defibrillation as a means of controlling the potential spread of airborne droplets.●If available, mechanical chest compression device may be used in place of manual compressions for adults and adolescents who meet minimum height and weight requirements.●For a critically ill patient who is already intubated and in the prone position at the time of arrest, CPR may be attempted with the patient prone by performing compressions with the hands over the T7/10 vertebral bodies. Defibrillation may be performed with the pads in the anterior-posterior position. The patient should be turned to the supine position for resuscitation only if able to do so without equipment disconnections that may lead to aerosolization of viral particles.●For out-of-hospital resuscitation efforts, lay rescuers should perform chest compression-only CPR while wearing a face mask or cloth covering. When available, an automated external defibrillator should be applied and used according to the usual protocol. (See ""Automated external defibrillators"" and ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"", section on 'Defibrillation'.)Initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, with the exception of IV magnesium, is not indicated for hemodynamically unstable or pulseless patients. A full discussion of the standard approaches to basic life support and advanced cardiac life support is presented separately. (See ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"" and ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of arrhythmias or conduction system disease. However, patients in whom arrhythmias may be seen include patients with myocardial injury, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, shock, electrolyte disturbances, or those receiving medications known to prolong the QT interval. (See 'Signs and symptoms' above.)●All patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected should have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the time of entry into the health care system. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single-lead or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient. Continuous ECG monitoring and echocardiography are not required in all patients but can be used in select situations. (See 'Cardiovascular testing' above.)●Patients with sustained torsades de pointes (TdP) usually become hemodynamically unstable, severely symptomatic, or pulseless and should be treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms, including cardioversion/defibrillation (algorithm 1). Patients with TdP who are hemodynamically stable on presentation may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. Treatment with intravenous (IV) magnesium along with correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements and/or removal of any inciting medications may be sufficient, although patients with frequent recurrent episodes may require additional interventions. (See 'Patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes)' above.)●Patients receiving QT-prolonging medications should have a baseline QTc value obtained prior to administering the drugs. If the QTc subsequently increases to ≥500 milliseconds or if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds from the baseline ECG, the risk versus benefit of continued treatment with the QT-prolonging medication should be reassessed, with consideration of dose adjustment or additional intervention. (See 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' above.)●The approach to caring for hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 differs slightly, with the intent to reduce exposure to (and spread of) COVID-19 to health care providers. In general, the number of persons interacting directly with the patient and the time spent in the room should be minimized. Social distancing should be maintained, with both the patient and other members of the health care team. (See 'Inpatient care and consultation' above and 'Arrhythmia-related procedures' above.)●The approaches to cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) interrogations and perioperative CIED management are summarized in the text. Strategies to avoid in-person device interrogations should be deployed. (See 'Cardiac implantable electrical device interrogations' above and 'Perioperative cardiac implantable electrical device management' above.)●In general, basic life support and advanced cardiac life support for patients with COVID-19 should be administered in standard fashion as for patients without COVID-19. However, any personnel caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (including gown, gloves, eye protection, and a respirator or face mask) before entering the room, the number of people involved in the resuscitation should be kept to a minimum, and early intubation should be performed for patients who are not yet intubated at the time of cardiac arrest.

ID:127556,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic, in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread. The WHO has indicated three priorities for countries [2]:●Protecting health workers●Engaging communities to protect those at highest risk of severe disease (eg, older adults and those with medical comorbidities)●Supporting vulnerable countries in containing infectionThe rapidly expanding COVID-19 acute respiratory pandemic has impacted all areas of daily life, including medical care. The primary intervention to slow disease spread has been social distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene, and staying home as much as possible. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Preventing exposure in the community'.) Delivering care for patients with cancer during this crisis is challenging given the competing risks of death from cancer versus death or serious complications from SARS-CoV-2, and the likely higher lethality of COVID-19 in immunocompromised hosts [3,4]. Many patients with cancer are struggling to receive treatment for their cancers due to hospitals canceling or delaying surgeries and other procedures, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. There is also concern that patients who are otherwise healthy and have curable cancers that require timely implementation of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation have unfortunately concluded that the risk of contracting COVID-19 may outweigh the benefits of cancer treatment [5]. Inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers, limited hospital capacity, including intensive care units (ICUs), and lack of point-of-care testing and seroprevalence data further complicate the difficulty. This topic will discuss issues related to balancing the risk from treatment delay versus harm from COVID-19, ways to minimize the compromise of social distancing during care delivery, how limited healthcare resources can be appropriately and fairly allocated, and reviews the recommendations for cancer care during the COVID-19 epidemic from expert groups [6-12].Issues pertaining to the coronavirus in the general population are discussed elsewhere, as are issues related to particular patient populations.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Pregnant and breastfeeding women'.)INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE IN CANCER PATIENTS — The prevalence of cancer in those with COVID-19 has varied across reports.Although limited, the best information on incidence of COVID-19 among patients with cancer comes from Wuhan, China [3]. Of the 1524 patients with cancer admitted to an oncology department over a six-week period from December 2019 to February 2020, 0.79 percent (12 patients) had infection with SARS-CoV-2. Although this infection rate was higher than the cumulative incidence in the community served by the hospital (0.37 percent), these patients were all sick enough to be admitted, and this report does not address the incidence of COVID-19 among community-dwelling outpatients with cancer.Other studies, also from Wuhan, China, suggest that among those with COVID-19, approximately 1 to 2 percent have cancer [13-16]. On the other hand, a higher prevalence of cancer in those with COVID-19 have been reported from the New York City area (in one report of 5700 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 6 percent had cancer [17]), and in Lombardy, Italy (8 percent of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU] for COVID-19 had either active or prior history of malignancy [18]). In another report, 20 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in all of Italy were in patients with active cancer [19]. As the infection becomes more widespread, the population concurrently challenged by cancer and COVID-19 will undoubtedly expand asymmetrically across different geographies and risk cohorts. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Impact of age'.)CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND OUTCOMES — As in non-cancer populations, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with cancer usually include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, rigors, and a loss of taste or smell. Reddish-purple nodules on the distal digits similar in appearance to pernio (chilblains) have also been described, mainly in children and young adults with documented or suspected COVID-19 (""COVID-toes""). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)Although COVID-19 is typically more severe and lethal among older people [20], people of any age with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk if they contract the virus [21]. These conditions include active or past history of cancer, particularly if they recently received or are continuing to receive treatment. However, data are extremely limited and more studies are needed.Data on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients are limited by small sample sizes. One is a report of 28 patients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in Wuhan, China [22]:●Regarding demographics, 67 percent were male, the median age was 65 years, and the most frequent cancer type (7 of 28, 25 percent) was lung cancer. Eight were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission.●Clinical characteristics included fever in 82 percent, dry cough in 81 percent, and dyspnea in 50 percent. Lymphopenia was present in 82 percent and 75 percent were anemic.●In terms of clinical course, more than one-half of the patients had severe disease (15 of 28, 54 percent), and six required admission to the ICU (21 percent). There were more severe events among the seven patients who had received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy within the last 14 days, relative to those who had not received treatment with the last 14 days (hazard ratio [HR] 4.079, 95% CI 1.086-15.322). The finding of patchy consolidation on admission computed tomography (CT) was also associated with a greater risk of severe disease (HR 5.438, 95% CI 1.498-19.748).●At the time of analysis, the outcome was fatal in 8 patients (29 percent); 10 had been discharged, and 10 remained in hospital.Is illness more severe in patients with malignancy? — Data are limited but suggest that the likelihood of a severe illness from COVID-19 is higher among patients with cancer. Most of the data are derived from patients treated in Wuhan, China, but data are emerging in other populations: ●An early prospective cohort study from China included approximately 1600 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory disease; 18 patients had cancer [23]. Among these 18 patients, there was a higher risk of severe events (defined as death or being admitted to the ICU requiring invasive ventilation) compared with patients without cancer (39 versus 8 percent). However, these 18 patients represented a heterogeneous group and were not an ideal representation of the entire population of patients with cancer [24].●A meta-analysis of four retrospective studies totaling 1356 COVID-infected patients, all treated in China, addressed the severity of complications from the disease in patients with malignancy [25-29]. Although patients with cancer accounted for a higher proportion of individuals with severe disease (3.9 versus 1.4 percent of those with non-severe disease, odds ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.00-5.23), there were only 33 cancer patients in all four studies, and the number of events overall was very low.●Additional information comes from an analysis of 105 patients with cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 in 14 hospitals in Wuhan, China, over a seven-week period, whose outcomes were compared with a control group of 536 patients without cancer, and matched for age, hospital, and hospitalization time [30]. Lung cancer was the most frequent malignancy (n = 22), followed by gastrointestinal (n = 13), breast (n = 11), or thyroid cancer (n = 11), and hematological malignancy (n = 9). Compared with the matched controls without cancer, patients with cancer had higher observed death rates (odds ratio [OR] 2.34, 95% CI 1.15-4.77), higher rates of ICU admission (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.59-5.08), a greater likelihood of severe symptoms (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.74-4.41), and a two-fold higher likelihood of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Notably, cancer patients also experienced more in-hospital infections (19 versus 1.5 percent) and were more likely to be smokers (34 versus 9 percent), which could have accounted for some of these differences. Patients with hematologic malignancies, lung cancer, and metastatic cancer had the highest frequency of severe events, but the number of patients in each category was small.  ●An analysis of 5688 patients diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 over a five-week period in a single New York City health system included 334 patients with cancer (6 percent); most had breast (n = 57) or prostate cancer (n = 56), followed by lung (n = 23), urothelial (n = 18) and colorectal cancer (n = 16) [31]. After adjusting for age, cancer patients aged 66 to 80 were intubated significantly more frequently than those without a diagnosis of cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.76, 95% CI 1.15-2.70); no significant difference was found in other age groups. Although cancer patients under age 50 had a fivefold higher mortality rate than those in this age group without cancer (RR 5.01, 95% CI 1.55-16.2), mortality rates from COVID-19 were not significantly higher in older patients with cancer compared with those without cancer.●Finally, in a small series of seven patients from Wuhan, China, undergoing lung resection who contracted COVID-19 in the perioperative period, three died (mortality rate 42 percent) [32].MANAGEMENT OF CANCER PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 SYMPTOMS OR A KNOWN COVID-19 EXPOSURE — Cancer can be an immunocompromised state, and many cancer treatments can further compromise the immune system. As such, cancer patients with fever or lower respiratory findings (eg, cough, dyspnea, hypoxia) are among the highest priority for COVID-19 testing. These patients should also be evaluated for alternative causes of their symptoms other than COVID-19, such as influenza, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary progression of their underlying cancer (eg, lymphangitic spread), or treatment-related side effects such as postsurgical or systemic therapy related pulmonary events (eg, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonitis, pulmonary edema/fluid overload, immunotherapy-related pneumonitis, etc). Other symptoms (eg, chills, muscle pain, sore throat) also raise the suspicion for COVID-19 and may warrant testing. (See 'Differentiating lymphangitic spread, pneumonitis, and COVID-19' below and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing' and ""Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy"" and ""Radiation-induced lung injury"".)We also recommend COVID-19 testing for cancer patients with an exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Particular considerations for testing of lung cancer patients are discussed below. (See 'Patients with lung cancer' below.)Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection — In general, immunosuppressive cancer therapy should be withheld in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, although data are very limited, a case report has suggested that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib for patients with a chronic hematologic malignancy may be a possible exception [33], and continuation of this class of drugs should be considered on a case-by-case basis [34]. Additionally, some oral non-immunosuppressive therapies (such as hormonal therapies or drugs targeting activating mutations (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] inhibitors or BRAF/MEK inhibitors) may be continued on a case-by-case basis.Many mild cases of COVID-19 (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea or hypoxia) and asymptomatic infections can be managed conservatively at home, if individuals can be adequately isolated. However, patients with more severe disease may warrant a higher level of care. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)Importantly, if a cancer patient with late-stage disease or with significant comorbid health conditions affecting the heart or lungs acquires severe COVID-19 and requires mechanical ventilation, the prognosis is likely to be dismal [35]. It is therefore imperative for clinicians to have proactive discussions with patients about goals of care and advance care planning, especially for those with advanced cancer [36]. Depending on state regulations, patients should be offered the option of completing a Physician Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form and/or other type of out-of-hospital do not resuscitate (DNR) order, especially if they would not want to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or mechanical ventilation. In the absence of an advance directive, a patient with underlying severe chronic illness and acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 who is getting worse despite maximal therapy may be appropriate for a unilateral DNR order to reduce the risk of medically futile CPR to patients, families, and health care workers. This may occur through informed consent with the patient or his/her surrogate, or occasionally, informed assent [36]. (See 'Advance care planning' below and ""Palliative care: Medically futile and potentially inappropriate therapies of questionable benefit"", section on 'The nudge/assent model'.)Management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)When can cancer treatment be safely restarted? — While there are no universally accepted guidelines as to when cancer therapies can be safely restarted after COVID-19 diagnosis, given that reinfection rates and their consequences are unknown, the effects of further suppressing or augmenting a patient's immune system quickly after COVID-19 must be weighed heavily against the risks of their unique tumor's biology. Our approach for most patients, which draws upon available guidelines and individual centers' ""best practices,"" is to hold immunosuppressives until symptoms from COVID-19 have resolved. Once symptoms have resolved, we retest for SARS-CoV-2 and proceed with planned cancer therapies only if a negative result is obtained. However, given a significant false negative rate in first-generation test kits, two consecutive negative tests ≥24 hours apart can be considered. However, whereas there is no consensus on this issue, clinical judgment and individualized decision-making is needed, particularly in settings in which curative therapies are being withheld. As an example, in advanced testicular cancer, delaying chemotherapy for any extended period of time is usually not appropriate, and the risk/benefit ratio would favor continuing treatment even if the patients had persistent viral shedding but felt clinically well. Although serological assays to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are being developed [37], these are not yet widely available. Once available, such assays can be used to identify patients with previous exposure and possible immunity. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings'.)Examples of approaches taken by expert groups and at other institutions are as follows:●For cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, ASCO recommends that immunosuppressive cancer treatments be held until symptoms are resolved (including resolution of fever without the use of antipyretics) and there is some certainty that the virus is no longer present (eg, a negative SARS-CoV-2 test), a position that is concordant with test-based strategies for discontinuing home isolation recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Their recommendation is for negative results of a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)An exception to this general recommendation would be if the cancer is rapidly progressing and the risk/benefit assessment favors proceeding with cancer treatment.●Notably, United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published rapid guidance on the delivery of anticancer therapy that suggests treatment may be initiated or resumed after only one negative SARS-CoV-2 test. Similar guidelines are followed at some institutions in the United States. However, given a significant false negative rate in first-generation test kits, two consecutive negative tests may be considered. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Interpretation'.) ●Outside of the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that to be released from home isolation, the patient must test negative using two samples collected at least 24 hours apart; where testing is not possible, confirmed patients should remain isolated for an additional two weeks after symptoms resolve. ●At some institutions, delayed reinitiation of treatment until asymptomatic for at least 14 days, with negative testing, is advocated. Sending these patients initially to an isolated infusion center, away from the main infusion center, may be recommended under these more stringent guidelines. This position stems from concerns as to the limitations of test strategies, and that some proportion of recovered patients who initially test negative might in fact be persistent virus shedders [38]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Symptomatic patients'.)●Guidelines have also been put forth by the CDC regarding return to work for healthcare workers who have recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection or have had an exposure. These are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Return to work for health care workers'.)Regardless of the timing of reinitiation of treatment, social distancing rules and contact limitation remain essential components of cancer treatments amid the pandemic to protect the patient, the health care workers, and other non-COVID-19 patients being treated in the same center.Persistent virus shedding — Patients with persistent viral shedding despite symptom resolution should stay on precautions/isolation until they convert to a negative test. The duration of viral shedding is variable; there appears to be a wide range, which may depend on severity of illness. An important point is that detecting viral RNA via a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. There may be a threshold of viral RNA level below which infectivity is unlikely. Nevertheless, there is no way to distinguish patients who remain infectious from those who do not. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Decision-making about reinitiation of chemotherapy is particularly difficult in these patients, particularly if the withheld treatments are potentially curative, and the period of persistent viral shedding goes on for several weeks. Decisions must be individualized, carefully weighing the risks and benefits of withholding versus restarting treatment.   Negative test for SARS-CoV-2 infection — In such patients, the approach depends on whether the patient is symptomatic, and if so, the cause for the respiratory symptoms and the cancer in question. For those in whom respiratory symptoms are mild, following an approach that is similar to those without respiratory symptoms may be appropriate; although travel history, recent contacts, and prevailing local public health conditions should be considered given the imperfect negative predictive value of current COVID-19 testing, which is discussed in detail elsewhere. Retesting may be needed in the index of suspicion is high. (See 'Management of cancer care in patients without COVID-19 symptoms' below and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Interpretation'.)For those with more severe symptoms, management will depend on the underlying etiology and goals of care. Careful consideration for non-COVID-19 and potentially cancer and/or treatment-related etiologies causing similar constellations of symptoms must always be considered.MANAGEMENT OF CANCER CARE IN PATIENTS WITHOUT COVID-19 SYMPTOMSRecommendations for general care of patients with cancer — At this time, neither a diagnosis of cancer nor active cancer treatment are indications for routine coronavirus testing in asymptomatic patients.The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) suggests the following guidance for general care from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):●General Health Care Facility and Health Care Professional guidance●Clinical care guidance ●Home care guidance ●High-risk subpopulation guidanceIn addition to the general CDC guidance, the following points were emphasized in the ASCO recommendations:●Patients should be informed regarding the symptoms of COVID-19, and trained in proper handwashing, hygiene, and minimizing exposure to sick contacts and large crowds.●At this time, no specific evidence or guidance on mask use for patients with cancer has been published. Patients and clinicians are urged to follow the CDC's general recommendations on mask wear, which now recommends that everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they go out in public, as well as guidance from local health authorities.There is no guidance or evidence to suggest that N95 masks are required for cancer patients. However, most institutions and clinical practices are requiring health care workers, patients, and visitors to wear a surgical face mask within the facility. (See 'Allocation of limited health care resources' below.)●In general, as recommended by the CDC, any clinic visits that can be postponed without risk to the patient should be postponed. This includes routine surveillance visits to detect cancer recurrence. In many cases, the recommended frequency of these visits is already considered a range (eg, three to six months), so extending the time between evaluations may still be within the recommendations. (See 'Minimizing the compromise of social distancing during cancer care delivery' below.)●For cancer patients with fever or other symptoms of infection, a comprehensive evaluation should be performed, as per usual medical practice. (See 'Management of cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)●Prescreening via telephone calls or digital platforms for COVID-19 symptoms and exposure history prior to planned in-person clinic visits is recommended, if possible [39]. Screening clinics should be developed to allow for patients with symptoms to be evaluated and tested in a dedicated unit with dedicated staff.●For asymptomatic patients with cancer, there is no specific guidance with respect to COVID-19 testing. Local and state public health directives and guidance on who should be tested and how the tests should be conducted should be followed. One possible exception may be patients with lung cancer. (See 'Patients with lung cancer' below.)As testing becomes more widely available, it may be reasonable to test asymptomatic patients who will be receiving immunosuppressive anticancer therapy or who are believed to otherwise be at risk for serious complications from COVID-19. This information may inform whether a delay in anticancer therapy may be warranted and to guide decisions around protecting health care providers and other patients.Further information is available within UpToDate on the evaluation, diagnosis, and screening for COVID-19 that are not specific to cancer patients. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)General considerations regarding cancer management — Delivering cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis is challenging given the competing risks of death from cancer versus death or serious complications from infection, and the likely higher lethality of COVID-19 in immunocompromised hosts, including those with cancer. Other challenges include cancellations of in-office visits, surgery postponements or cancellations, social distancing in the office, and the transition to telemedicine for many visits. (See 'Minimizing the compromise of social distancing during cancer care delivery' below.)There is no ""one size fits all"" approach to delivering cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and treatment decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. Relevant issues are expanded upon in the following sections.Cancer diagnosis and staging — In general, as recommended by the CDC, any clinic visits that can be postponed without risk to the patient should be postponed. As an example, this might include a patient who is clinically suspected of disease with a low risk of rapid progression (eg, minor suspicious findings on mammography). There is no evidence that COVID-19 infection interferes with or has an effect on the diagnosis and staging of cancer. In a patient newly diagnosed with cancer, it is reasonable to limit staging procedures and pretreatment evaluation only to those that are most necessary to inform development of the initial care plan.Cancer surgery — The CDC's guidance for health care facilities and guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that ""elective surgeries"" at inpatient facilities should be rescheduled, if possible. However, clinicians and patients need to make individual determinations, based on the potential harms of delaying needed cancer-related surgery; in many cases these surgeries cannot be considered ""elective."" The American College of Surgeons notes that cases that involve cancers that may progress without treatment should be performed as resources permit, to minimize the need for emergency procedures, which are often more complicated and more likely to consume limited resources. Also, if a surgery will likely require postoperative intensive care, the capacity of available intensive care units (ICUs) should be considered as part of decision-making. (See 'Recommendations for general care of patients with cancer' above.)As health care facilities consider resuming elective surgical cases, the American College of Surgeons and other groups have issued the following recommendations [40,41]: (1) SARS-CoV-2 infection rates should be on a downward trend for at least two weeks at the facility's geographic location; (2) resource utilization, including ICU bed and personal protective equipment (PPE), must be carefully calibrated; (3) testing of patients and employees must be strongly considered; and (4) prioritization and scheduling of cases must be managed carefully by all key stakeholders.Other resources for resuming cases are available [42,43].In some cases, neoadjuvant therapy may be used as a means of delaying surgery. As an example, patients with rectal cancer may undergo chemoradiotherapy plus upfront chemotherapy (total neoadjuvant therapy) rather than chemoradiotherapy alone as a means of delaying surgery. (See ""Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma"", section on 'Total neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors'.)In other situations where neoadjuvant hormonal therapy is not routinely considered (eg, early stage breast cancer, high-risk prostate cancer), it may be reasonable to offer neoadjuvant therapy or to simply delay surgery rather than proceeding to upfront surgery. The risks of tumor progression with delay in definitive surgery should be weighed against the potential added burden on hospital resources, case complexity, and the risk of exposure to COVID-19. However, neoadjuvant therapy that requires clinic visits, clinician-patient contact, or that is immunosuppressive must also be viewed with the potential incremental risks to the patient.Specific guidance for decision-making for cancer surgery on a disease-by-disease basis is available from the American College of Surgeons, from the Society for Surgical Oncology, from an international Urologic Oncology Group, and from the European Society of Surgical Oncology. Radiation therapy — Some patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) with curative intent or for rapidly progressive tumors may reasonably proceed with therapy, as the risks of delaying treatment may outweigh the risks of COVID-19 exposure and infection. Where available, alternative regimens should be offered. As an example, an international expert consensus statement has recommended that neoadjuvant short course RT be preferred over long-course chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer during the pandemic [44]. (See ""Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma"", section on 'Short-course radiotherapy'.) For those receiving RT for symptom control, or for whom an alteration of schedule is unlikely to significantly impact outcome, treatment should be delayed or adjusted. According to the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), if hypofractionated schedules are considered reasonable, they should be considered. Similarly, the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group has issued guidance on alternative radiation treatment schemes in blood cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [45].For patients who are actively undergoing RT with established treatment plans, the decision to continue requires careful consideration of indications, dose already delivered, and risks and benefits. ASTRO suggests that cancellation or delay in cancer treatment may be an appropriate option for patients with COVID-19, after a reassessment of the patient's goals of care. Recommendations are also available from an international Radiation Oncology Group called the Global Radiation Oncology Targeted Response.Systemic anticancer treatments — There is no direct evidence to support changing or withholding chemotherapy or immunotherapy in patients with cancer [46], and routinely withholding critical anticancer or potentially immunosuppressive therapy is not recommended. The balance of potential harms that may result from delaying or interrupting treatment versus the potential benefits of possibly preventing or delaying COVID-19 infection is very uncertain. ASCO recommends that clinical decisions be individualized, and consider factors such as the curability of the cancer, the risk of cancer recurrence with treatment delay, modification or interruption; the number of cycles of therapy already completed; and the patient's tolerance of treatment.●Chemotherapy – Administration of chemotherapy is determined on a case-by-case basis. The decision is influenced by the likelihood of cure or extension of life from the cancer treatments, the potential risks of delaying treatment, the patient's tolerance of treatment, where they are in the planned treatment course, and the local incidence of coronavirus and availability of necessary resources. In general, adjuvant therapy with curative intent should likely proceed, despite the threat of SARS CoV-2 infection during therapy. Shorter treatment duration should be considered, where feasible. (See ""Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer"", section on 'Duration of therapy'.)For patients receiving palliative therapy for metastatic disease, the decision to continue requires careful consideration of indications, response to treatment already delivered, and risks and benefits of continued treatment. In some cases, treatment delays may lead to worsening symptoms and performance status and the loss of the opportunity to treat [35]. Considerations should include how such delays require hospital admission for palliation of symptoms, which would further stress available resources. Shared decision-making is paramount.Considerations for chemotherapy treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic set forth by ASCO include the following:•For patients in deep remission who are receiving maintenance therapy, stopping chemotherapy may be an option. Similarly, for those in whom the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is expected to be small and where non-immunosuppressive therapies are available (eg, hormone therapy for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer or prostate cancer), it may be reasonable to omit chemotherapy in consideration of the risks of COVID-19.•Oral chemotherapy and home infusion of chemotherapy drugs (if logistically feasible) may be options for some, but require coordination with the oncology team to ensure that patients are taking their treatments correctly. •If a particular cancer center is heavily affected by coronavirus infections, it may be reasonable to alter the chemotherapy schedule so that fewer visits are needed or to arrange infusion at a less affected cancer center.Specific guidance for treatment of hematologic malignancies on a disease-by-disease basis is available from the American Society of Hematology. The use of prophylactic growth factors is discussed below. (See 'Supportive care' below.)●Immunotherapy – At this time, there are no data regarding whether checkpoint inhibitor therapy increases, decreases, or has no effect on the severity of coronavirus infection and the immune response to it. Of particular concern is treatment-related pneumonitis, which may increase the risk of serious complications if the patient develops COVID-19. For those with a known coronavirus exposure, it is recommended to hold treatment until it is clear that the patient will not develop COVID-19. (See 'Management of cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)Updated guidelines from ASCO suggest that the potential harms and benefit of therapy with these agents should be carefully considered for each patient, and that where possible, testing for SARS-CoV-2 prior to therapy with these agents is reasonable. Less frequent drug administration is an option for patients who are already receiving the drug. One modeling study suggested that pembrolizumab 400 mg every six weeks leads to similar exposures as every three week administration of a single dose of either 200 mg or 2 mg/kg [47]. The safety and efficacy of this extended dosing option has been shown in patients with advanced melanoma [48], and this is an appropriate option for some patients receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy, particularly in areas where the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is high. Both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have approved a new dosing regimen of 400 mg every six weeks for pembrolizumab across all currently approved adult indications, in addition to the current 200 mg every three week dosing regimen [49,50].Decisions regarding whether it is appropriate to use combination versus single agent immunotherapy will need to be individualized. The risks of immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) associated with ipilimumab-containing combination regimens (or other immunotherapy combinations), including the risks of hospitalization and associated COVID-19 exposure, should be weighed against the diminished efficacy of single agent therapy, in each particular setting. Other considerations are similar as to those receiving chemotherapy. (See ""Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy"".)●Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation – Although there are limited data regarding the impact of COVID-19 in transplant candidates and donors and cellular therapy recipients, there is sufficient concern that COVID-19 could have a significant impact on posttransplant or post-therapy outcomes. Decisions on whether hematopoietic cell transplantation should be delayed must be individualized.The American Society of Hematology has published a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that pertain to treating hematologic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which address the role of induction and consolidation therapies, including hematopoietic cell transplantation in many malignancies. In addition, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance have provided guidance on stem cell transplantation and COVID-19 that may be of value.Considerations from ASCO include the following:•It may be prudent to test potential donors for COVID-19 even in an absence of evidence of transmission by blood transfusion.•As a general precaution, visitation post-transplant may need to be limited and visitors may need to be screened for symptoms and potential exposure.Supportive care — ASCO has set forth the following recommendations:●Although myeloid growth factor support is typically administered for those at high risk for febrile neutropenia (>20 percent), it may be reasonable for patients with a lower level of expected risk for febrile neutropenia with treatment (eg, >10 percent) to be prescribed prophylaxis with growth factor support.●There is no known role for prophylactic antiviral therapy for COVID-19 in any patient, including immune suppressed patients.●For patients who are febrile and likely to be neutropenic based on the timing of their cancer treatments, it may be reasonable to prescribe empiric antibiotics if the patient seems stable by clinical assessment (in person or via telemedicine evaluation). It is preferable that further evaluation be pursued, if necessary, outside of the emergency department.●Flushing of ports can occur at intervals as long as every 12 weeks, and patients who are capable of flushing their own devices should be encouraged to do so. However, the process of training may itself be a source of exposure and access to sterile supplies at home may be limited. (See 'Managing subcutaneous ports' below.)●Transfusions should be given according to usual practice guidelines, if possible, with consideration of erythropoietin-stimulating agents if severe or life-threatening anemia is anticipated or if blood products become scarce due to lack of donations. If anemia is due to bleeding, tumor embolization, volume expanders, and antifibrinolytic agents (eg, epsilon aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid, where available) can be offered as a temporizing measure; iron infusions are another option for those in less immediate need. In the operating room, the use of cell saver may also be appropriate.For patients in need of other blood products such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or platelets, care should be individualized based on the indications, severity, and alternatives. Donor-directed transfusions should be encouraged from patient family members in order to help sustain blood product supply during the pandemic.Advance care planning — Proactive advance care planning is important for all cancer patients, but is particularly critical given the additional risk of COVID-19. Aligning the care that is delivered with the patient's values and goals of care in the setting of an acute life-threatening illness is important, especially for patients with chronic, life-limiting disease. Individuals who are most likely to develop severe illness will be older and have a greater burden of chronic illness; these are the very populations who may wish to forego prolonged life support, should the need arise. If an oncology patient with late-stage disease or with significant comorbid health conditions affecting the heart or lungs develops COVID-19 and requires mechanical ventilation, the prognosis is likely to be dismal [35]. (See 'Management of cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)Because of these issues, it is imperative for clinicians to have proactive discussions with patients about advance care planning, especially for those with advanced cancer [36]. This should include the use of advance directives or other expressions of end-of-life preferences, and clear documentation of these conversations, especially if they take place during a telehealth visit.The following resources are available from the Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) and Respecting Choices:●CAPC COVID-19 Response Resources●Respecting Choices COVID-19 Tools and ResourcesFor cancer patients with COVID-19, who are at increased risk of needing mechanical ventilation or ICU care, a conversation about Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) is appropriate. Additional information is available at National POLST.Post-treatment surveillance — ASCO suggests that any clinic visits that can be postponed without risk to the patient should be postponed. This includes routine surveillance in patients who have completed treatment or those on active surveillance considered to be at relatively low risk of recurrence or disease progression, and those who are asymptomatic during the follow-up period. In situations where existing recommendations provide frequency ranges for interventions (eg, every three to six months), it is reasonable to delay scheduled interventions to the longest recommended frequency duration. Remote monitoring of such patients using telehealth may be adopted.Mental health issues — Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic is leading to mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear [51]. Cancer patients on and off treatment may have additional feelings of anxiety, fear, and vulnerability for disease recurrence or progression. As resources become constrained, cancer patients may feel loneliness and isolation as they watch their system swamped with cases that literally freeze them out. (See 'Allocation of limited health care resources' below.)Specific resources are available for patients. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)Clinicians are also at risk for increased anxiety and stress because of [52,53]:●Physical isolation from friends and family●Worry about their own health and health of family, peers, and colleagues●Competing demands of typical daily workload and COVID-19 response especially coupled with changes in family care responsibilities●Difficult choices and challenges in patient care, worry about patients, and the need to support patients and families during reduced visitationASCO has recommended mental health resources with tips on enhancing coping. The suggestions include avoiding information overload, and taking a break from news and social media regarding COVID-19. There is also a set of tips for enhancing mental and physical health during the pandemic.Resources are also available from the National Alliance on Mental Illness and a wide variety of other groups. (See 'Society guideline links' below and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Psychiatric issues"".)Cancer type-specific guidanceConceptual framework — A conceptual approach to decision-making regarding immediate cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic has been described, which balances the risk of progression with delay of cancer care versus the risk for significant morbidity from COVID-19 [54]. The list below presents examples that are meant to provide general guidance. Specific patient comorbidities as well as values and preferences must also be considered in each case. Specific considerations for lung cancer patients are discussed below. (See 'Patients with lung cancer' below.)●Based on low risk of progression in certain cancers, it may be safe to delay for more than three months certain treatments, regardless of age.•These include surgery and radiation (where indicated) for the following:-Nonmelanoma skin cancer.-Hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In such women, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be administered.•Similarly, medical oncology treatments may be delayed for chronic hematologic cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Specific guidance is available from the American Society of Hematology.●Based on intermediate risk of progression in other cancers, a delay of approximately three months may be acceptable in the following settings, particularly for individuals 50 and older.•Surgery for the following:-High-risk prostate cancer (androgen deprivation may be started in the interim)-Colon cancer with low risk for imminent obstruction-Low-risk melanoma•Radiation for post-resection endometrial cancer and high-risk resected prostate cancer.•In selected cases, chemotherapy for advanced metastatic breast, colorectal, lung, and other solid tumors. However, these are difficult decisions, and must be individualized. For some patients with rapidly progressive metastatic disease or a high tumor burden, a delay of three months could be catastrophic. In such cases, shared decision-making is critically important. In contrast, active surveillance may be an appropriate option for some patients with slow-growing advanced disease, such as some patients with indolent or low tumor burden metastatic clear cell renal cancer [55]. (See ""Systemic therapy of advanced clear cell renal carcinoma"", section on 'Active surveillance'.)●By contrast, given a high risk of progression in certain cancers, ideally there would be no delay in treatments for the following individuals under age 70, although for older individuals, benefits of immediate treatment must be balanced against the risks:•Surgery for the following:-≥2 cm lung mass-Colon cancer with imminent obstruction-Type 2 endometrial cancer-Pancreatic, ovarian, or liver mass(es) suspicious for malignancy-High-risk non-muscle invasive or muscle invasive urothelial cancer•Radiation for the following:-Lung cancer-Locally advanced rectal cancer-Head and neck cancer•Chemotherapy for the following:-Acute leukemia, large cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, symptomatic myeloma, and all other non-low-grade hematologic cancers-Metastatic testicular cancer-Small cell lung cancer-Most head and neck cancers, except thyroidOther conceptual frameworks for prioritizing radiation and systemic treatment for cancer during the pandemic are available [56]. In addition to potentially altering therapeutic protocols, other actions that have been suggested to increase the safety of managing oncologic care during the COVID-19 pandemic include screening all patients, caregivers, staff, and providers for COVID-19 symptoms; limiting exposure to sick contacts while on anticancer therapy; minimizing nonessential follow-up visits; restricting visitors to both outpatient and inpatient facilities; increasing engagement in telehealth and phone visits rather than in-person clinic visits; and prescribing oral drugs that can be taken at home, rather than injectable agents requiring administration in an infusion center, whenever possible.Guidance from expert groups — Guidance is available from several expert groups on how care for certain cancer types should be affected by COVID-19. The following is not an exhaustive list, and additional society guideline links are provided elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.). ●Breast cancer – In addition to guidance on breast cancer surgery from the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Breast Surgeons and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) have published brief, high-level guidance on prioritization for multidisciplinary care in breast cancer. ●Gastrointestinal cancers – In addition to guidance on colorectal surgery from the American College of Surgeons, and on gastrointestinal tract cancer surgery from ESMO, an American group of oncologists has developed recommendations for minimizing risks to patients with gastrointestinal malignancies [57].●Genitourinary cancers – In addition to guidance from ESMO, Canadian guidelines on prioritizing systemic therapy for patients with genitourinary malignancies are available, and there are also recommendations for triage of urologic surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic from a multidisciplinary group [58]. Recommendations for appropriate triage of outpatient procedures have also been proposed [59]. ●Gynecologic cancers – In addition to guidance form ESMO, and the American College of Surgeons, guidance for management of these cancers is available from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, the National College of French Gynecologists and obstetricians [60], from the editors of the International Journal of Gynecologic Cancer [61], and from the International Gynecologic Cancer Society. ●Hematologic malignancy – In addition to guidelines from the American Society of Hematology, the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT), the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), and ESMO, the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance has published guidance on managing patients with hematologic malignancies, which is in press [62]. The International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group has issued guidance on alternative radiation treatment schemes in blood cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [45].●Hepatocellular carcinoma – In addition to ESMO, the International Liver Cancer Association has issued guidance on management of HCC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional information on issues relevant to solid organ transplantation is available elsewhere.●Lung cancer – In addition to the American College of Surgeons, the Thoracic Surgery Outcomes Research Network has published guidance on triage for thoracic surgery in patients with thoracic malignancy [63]. Additionally, ESMO has laid out specific guidelines for the types of lung cancer care that should be considered high priority (should not be delayed), medium priority (should not be delayed more than six weeks), and low priority (patient condition is stable enough that services can be delayed for the duration of the pandemic, or the intervention is unlikely to have a significant magnitude of benefit). Guidance in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is provided by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC).Additional considerations for care of lung cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic are provided below. (See 'Patients with lung cancer' below.)●Neurooncology – Joint guidance on care of patients with brain tumors and brain metastases is available from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Tumor Section/Society for Neuro-Oncology [64], and specific guidance for management of glioma patients is available from an international multidisciplinary group [65].●Neuroendocrine tumors – Guidance in managing neuroendocrine tumors during the COVID-19 pandemic are available from the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS). SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONSUpper aerodigestive tract procedures — Because of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (eg, otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopists) are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations has been developed to guide evaluation and surgery of the head and neck during the pandemic [66]. At many institutions, testing for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is mandatory before such procedures are undertaken in patients. Given the significant risks of treating upper aerodigestive tract diseases in patients with COVID-19 and the uncertain but considerably lower specificity of current tests, two negative tests spaced ≥24 hours apart have been recommended for these patients. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)  Differentiating lymphangitic spread, pneumonitis, and COVID-19 — Some systemic cancer treatments are associated with a risk of pneumonitis (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors, gemcitabine, mechanistic (previously referred to as mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors). (See ""Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy"", section on 'Pneumonitis' and ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Molecularly targeted agents"" and ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with systemic antineoplastic therapy: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment"" and ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Molecularly targeted agents"", section on 'Rapamycin and analogs'.)In other cases, new infiltrates on radiographic imaging may reflect disease progression (eg, lymphangitic spread). Besides the fact that treatment-related pneumonitis might increase the risk of serious complications if the patient develops COVID-19, it may be difficult to distinguish therapy effect versus disease progression versus viral infection. In this setting, treatment should be held until it is clear that the diagnosis is not COVID-19. Testing for COVID-19 is appropriate in such circumstances, similar to the approach taken for patients with new respiratory symptoms. (See 'Management of cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)Managing subcutaneous ports — The typical frequency for maintenance flushing of subcutaneous ports is once every four to six weeks. However, at least some data suggest that extending the maintenance flushing interval of implanted ports in adult oncology patients to once every 12 weeks is safe and effective [67]. Patients who are capable of flushing their own devices may be encouraged to do so. However, the process of training may itself be a source of exposure and access to sterile supplies at home may be limited. (See 'Supportive care' above.)Cancer survivors — It is unclear if cancer survivors who have completed treatment are at increased risk for COVID-19 and its complications; such risk may be influenced by the type of cancer, treatment received, and patient age and comorbid medical conditions. The duration of time off therapy may be important, although late and long-term effects of prior treatment (ie, pulmonary or cardiac toxicities, persistent immunosuppression) may pose risks.Common questions about COVID-19 and answers for patients and cancer survivors are available from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (NCCS) [68]. In addition, a compilation of selected COVID-19 resources for cancer survivors and health care providers in the United States is available [69]. Patients with lung cancer●SARS-CoV-2 testing – Some have advocated for SARS-CoV-2 testing in all lung cancer patients, regardless of symptomatology, given that these patients often have baseline pulmonary deficits and other comorbidities [70,71]. Although this is not yet standard practice everywhere, it is a reasonable approach if adequate testing is available.●Risk – There remains a lack of clarity regarding the effect of current versus previous cancer treatments and other comorbidities on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 [5]. However, patients with lung cancer may be at higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 than the general population, and COVID-19 may interfere with effective diagnostic and therapeutic lung cancer management [71]. It has also been postulated that smoking history and prior tobacco-related lung damage increase the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection [70,72]. Given all of these issues, such patients should be particularly cautious, given that many have baseline respiratory comorbidity or impairment due to the cancer itself, and should immediately report any new or changing symptoms to their clinicians.In preliminary results of a registry study including 200 patients with thoracic cancer also diagnosed with COVID-19 infection through laboratory tests, or with suspected COVID-19 infection based on exposure and symptoms, the majority of patients were hospitalized (76 percent), and one third of these patients died [73]. Approximately three-quarters of patients had metastatic disease. Approximately one third of all patients were receiving chemotherapy alone, one quarter were receiving immunotherapy alone, and 19 percent were receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone. Although the mortality rate of COVID-19 in patients with thoracic cancer was high, it did not appear to be associated with any specific type of treatment, or other clinical feature, based on univariate and multivariate analyses.Previous smaller studies, with fewer than 10 patients with lung cancer and COVID-19, have not suggested higher rates of severe events compared with patients with other cancer types [23]), although there has been some suggestion that older patients with NSCLC have more severe effects from COVID-19 than younger patients [3].Overall these studies are small, and the risks of COVID-19 for those with lung cancer, particularly older patients, are not completely understood. However, data are rapidly evolving.●Impact on diagnosis and treatment•Distinguishing lung cancer evolution from a potential COVID-19 superinfection on the basis of radiologic or clinical presentation can be difficult. The main CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia can overlap with CT findings that are often found in patients with progressive lung cancer. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.)In addition, the worsening pulmonary symptoms during lung cancer progression can be similar to that typical of COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.) •Adding further complexity, pneumonitis can also be induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, an effective and widely used standard of care treatment for lung cancer in various treatment lines and settings [74]. Although the risk of pneumonitis is approximately 2 percent in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors for a variety of cancers, it may be higher in patients with lung cancer [75]. The clinical symptoms and radiologic imaging findings associated with pneumonitis may overlap with those of COVID-19.Pneumonitis may also complicate molecularly-targeted therapies such as osimertinib and standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Furthermore, cytotoxic chemotherapy can have immunosuppressive effects. (See ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Molecularly targeted agents"" and ""Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Cytotoxic agents"".)•The clinical and biologic aggressiveness of many lung cancers often does not allow for anticancer therapy to be withheld or postponed. •Specific guidance for lung cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is available from several expert groups. (See 'Cancer type-specific guidance' above.)MINIMIZING THE COMPROMISE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING DURING CANCER CARE DELIVERY — Patients undergoing cancer care including diagnosis, counseling, active treatment, and surveillance are highly exposed to medical centers, providers, staff, and other patients. This results in a massive number of personal contact points and a large number of potential opportunities for viral transmission for both patients and caregivers. ASCO guidelines recommend adoption of telemedicine visits for patients not requiring a physical exam, treatment, or in-office diagnostics. An important point is that while telemedicine is an important paradigm for patient provider communication, in an effort to maximize social distancing, it has the potential to interrupt important aspects of the patient's relationships with the care team. This can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings as well as avoidable delays and even adverse events related to improper care. As patients and providers utilize telephone and video platforms to communicate and deliver care, both must accept the benefits as well as the risks. Operationalizing televisit workflows to mimic those that providers and patients are accustomed to in person may be helpful to maintain familiarity and avoid missed opportunities to improve care and communication.At the same time, personal contact often provides confidence, reassurance, and comfort that the patient is receiving optimal care. For patients who are already coming in to the cancer center for imaging, procedures, surgeries, radiation therapy, or infusions, a face-to-face visit remains an important option, with the usual precautions (masks, strict attention to hand hygiene). In general, minimizing time in waiting rooms, rearranging patient contact areas to maximize social distancing, augmenting early discharge planning efforts, executing prompt and safe discharge events, minimizing visitors, instituting pharmacy deliveries, and anticipating/avoiding the possibility of urgent care/emergency department visits (eg, consider more delayed removal of drains/catheters based on risk benefit profile) are all necessary steps in creating a safe experience [76]. Both ASCO and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network have issued recommendations for oncology practices to keep patients with cancer, as well as their caregivers and health care staff, as safe as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic [39]. ALLOCATION OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE RESOURCES — The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging health care systems worldwide and raising important ethical issues, especially regarding the potential need for rationing health care in the context of scarce resources and crisis capacity. Limited availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) has complicated medical care of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 (and other transmissible conditions) worldwide. In general, social distancing and barrier protective measures are the most potent forms of COVID-19 avoidance. We suggest following the CDC recommendations on face mask wearing. Further measures to prevent viral spread are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Local and regional considerations and policies should be informed on prevailing conditions. Special attention should be paid to augmenting PPE for care providers in close contact with known COVID-19-positive patients and those who manage the airway and respiratory tracts. Rapidly emerging data suggest that PPE such as N95 masks can safely be sterilized for reuse. In the United States, the CDC offers guidance on optimizing the supply of PPE when sudden increases in patient volume threaten a facility's PPE capacity. Strategies include canceling non-urgent procedures or visits that would warrant use of PPE, prioritizing the use of certain PPE for the highest risk situations, and cautious extended or limited reuse of PPE. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'When PPE is limited'.)Beyond the care of individual patients, oncology clinicians may face the reality of rationing care due to limited resources, particularly hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. In the face of limited resources, clinicians must consider carefully what cancer treatments are most likely to be successful, symptom-relieving, or life-saving, and identify those patients who are likely to get the greatest benefit from treatment [35,77]. If treatments are withheld, from a medico-legal standpoint, national and local guideline standards should be followed [78,79]. ASCO has released guidance on allocation of limited resources during the COVID-19 pandemic [80]. They emphasize that decisions regarding allocation of scarce resources should be separated from bedside decision-making. In addition, interim guidelines for use during the COVID-19 pandemic are available from the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) for use of PPE during clinical oncology care and for safe handling and administration of hazardous cancer drugs. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care issues"", section on 'Surge capacity and scarce resource allocation'.)While high quality of and accessibility to care remains the greatest concern of providers, as resources become constrained, cancer patients may feel that their disease progression may become collateral damage to healthcare shortages and deferrals. Neither patients nor clinicians have any significant experience with rationing of care. Addressing fears such as these is critical to an open dialogue and may lead to opportunities to improve communication and prioritize care goals and shared decision-making. (See 'Mental health issues' above.)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored disease-specific guidelines (including those for hematology and oncology patients) from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Delivering cancer care during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is challenging given the competing risks of death from cancer versus death from infection, and the higher lethality of COVID-19 infection in immunocompromised hosts, among other reasons. Clinicians must balance the risks of delaying cancer treatments versus the risks for SARS CoV-2 exposure and the potential increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, while navigating the disruption in care associated with social distancing and limited health care resources. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Data are limited but suggest that the likelihood of a severe illness from COVID-19 is higher among patients with cancer, particularly if they recently received or are continuing to receive treatment. It is unclear if cancer survivors who have completed treatment are at increased risk for COVID-19 and its complications; such risk may be influenced by the type of cancer, treatment received that could have resulted in long-term cardiopulmonary toxicity or immune system compromise, time since treatment, patient age and comorbid medical conditions. (See 'Is illness more severe in patients with malignancy?' above and 'Cancer survivors' above.)●For cancer patients with lower respiratory symptoms and/or signs (eg, fever, cough, dyspnea, or hypoxia), or those with exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19, we proceed with testing for SARS-CoV-2. These patients should also be evaluated for alternative causes of their symptoms. (See 'Management of cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' above.)•For patients who test positive, immunosuppressive cancer treatments should be held at least until symptoms from COVID-19 have resolved. Some oral non-immunosuppressive therapies may be continued on a case-by-case basis.•While there are no universally accepted guidelines as to when immunosuppressive cancer therapies can be safely restarted after COVID-19 diagnosis, the effects of further suppressing or augmenting a patient's immune system quickly after COVID-19 must be weighed heavily against the risks of their unique tumor's biology. Our approach for most patients, which draws upon available guidelines and individual centers' ""best practices,"" is to hold immunosuppressives until symptoms from COVID-19 have resolved. Once symptoms have resolved, we retest for SARS-CoV-2 and proceed with planned cancer therapies only if a negative result is obtained. However, given a significant false negative rate in first-generation test kits, two consecutive negative tests ≥24 hours apart can be considered.However, there is no consensus on this issue, and at some institutions, more stringent guidelines are advocated, with delayed reinitiation of treatment until asymptomatic for at least 14 days and with two negative tests, at least 24 hours apart. Clinical judgment and individualized decision-making is needed, particularly in settings in which curative therapies are being withheld. (See 'When can cancer treatment be safely restarted?' above.)Patients with persistent viral shedding despite symptom resolution should stay on precautions/isolation until they convert to a negative test. Decision-making about reinitiation of chemotherapy is particularly difficult in these patients, particularly if the withheld treatments are potentially curative, and decisions must be individualized, carefully weighing the risks and benefits of withholding versus restarting treatment.   •For patients who test negative, the approach depends on the cause for the respiratory symptoms and the cancer in question.●For patients without lower respiratory symptoms or signs, neither a diagnosis of cancer nor active cancer treatment are indications for coronavirus testing. No specific evidence or guidance on mask use specifically for patients with cancer has been published. However, cancer patients are urged to follow the CDC's general recommendations in this regard, which are now that everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they go out in public. All patients should be informed regarding the symptoms of COVID-19, and trained in proper handwashing, hygiene, and minimizing exposure to sick contacts and large crowds. (See 'Recommendations for general care of patients with cancer' above.)●A decision-making approach regarding immediate versus delayed cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is presented above, which balances the estimated risk of progression with delay of cancer care versus the risk for significant morbidity from COVID-19. Additionally, several groups have laid out cancer type-specific guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, individual patient morbidities and values and preferences must also be weighed in these decisions. (See 'Cancer type-specific guidance' above.)•Clinicians should proactively discuss goals of care and advance care planning, including advance directives, especially for those with advanced cancer who are or may be infected with COVID-19. (See 'Advance care planning' above.)●Given the number of opportunities for viral transmission for both patients and caregivers during cancer care, the use of video and/or telephone visits is encouraged, but both clinicians and patients must accept the benefits as well as the risks. When patients must receive in-person care, specific strategies can be used to accomplish social distancing (eg, minimizing time in waiting rooms, minimizing/restricting visitors, instituting pharmacy deliveries, and avoiding emergency department visits, when possible). (See 'Minimizing the compromise of social distancing during cancer care delivery' above.)●Limited availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) has complicated medical care of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 (and other transmissible conditions) worldwide. In general, social distancing and barrier protective measures are the most potent forms of COVID-19 avoidance. We suggest following the CDC recommendations on facemask wearing and optimizing the supply of PPE when sudden increases in patient volume threaten a facility's PPE.

These resources come from select society and government-sponsored guidelines from several countries and regions around the world. Guidelines for medical professionals are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"".)We will update these links periodically; newer versions of some guidelines may be available on each society's website. Some societies may require users to log in to access their guidelines. The recommendations in the following guidelines may vary from those that appear in UpToDate topic reviews. Readers who are looking for UpToDate topic reviews should use the UpToDate search box to find the relevant content.UpToDate also offers ""The Basics"" patient education pieces. These are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and answer the main questions a patient is likely to have. We encourage you to print or email these topics to your patients. (See ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education:
