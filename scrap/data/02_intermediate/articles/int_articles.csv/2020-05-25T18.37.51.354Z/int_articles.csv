The absence of an effective treatment against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led clinicians to redirect drugs that are known to be effective for other medical conditions to the treatment of COVID-19. Key among these repurposed therapeutic agents are the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine, which is used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.1Principi N Esposito S Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of COVID-19.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online April 17.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30296-6Google Scholar,  2Perricone C Triggianese P Bartoloni E et al.The anti-viral facet of anti-rheumatic drugs: lessons from COVID-19.J Autoimmun. 2020;  (published online April 17.)DOI:10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102468Google Scholar These drugs have been shown in laboratory conditions to have antiviral properties as well as immunomodulatory effects.3Liu J Cao R Xu M et al.Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 16Google Scholar,  4Devaux CA Rolain JM Colson P Raoult D New insights on the antiviral effects of chloroquine against coronavirus: what to expect for COVID-19?.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 12.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938Google Scholar However, the use of this class of drugs for COVID-19 is based on a small number of anecdotal experiences that have shown variable responses in uncontrolled observational analyses, and small, open-label, randomised trials that have largely been inconclusive.5Tang W Cao Z Han M et al.Hydroxychloroquine in patients mainly with mild to moderate COVID-19: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online May 7.)

Moreover, we screened preprint servers, such as Medrxiv, for relevant articles and consulted the web pages of organisations such as the US National Institutes of Health and WHO. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (used with or without a macrolide) are widely advocated for treatment of COVID-19 based on in-vitro evidence of an antiviral effect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Their use is based on small uncontrolled studies and in the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials. Concerns have been raised that these drugs or their combination with macrolides could result in electrical instability and predispose patients to ventricular arrhythmias. Whether these drugs improve outcomes or are associated with harm in COVID-19 remains unknown.Added value of this studyIn the absence of reported randomised trials, there is an urgent need to evaluate real-world evidence related to outcomes with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (used with or without macrolides) in COVID-19. Using an international, observational registry across six continents, we assessed 96 032 patients with COVID-19, of whom 14 888 were treated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or their combination with a macrolide. After controlling for age, sex, race or ethnicity, underlying comorbidities, and disease severity at baseline, the use of all four regimens was associated with an increased hazard for de-novo ventricular arrythmia and death in hospital. This study provides real-world evidence on the use of these therapeutic regimens by including a large number of patients from across the world. Thus, to our knowledge, these findings provide the most comprehensive evidence of the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) for treatment of COVID-19.Implications of all the available evidenceWe found no evidence of benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used either alone or with a macrolide. Previous evidence was derived from either small anecdotal studies or inconclusive small randomised trials. Our study included a large number of patients across multiple geographic regions and provides the most robust real-world evidence to date on the usefulness of these treatment regimens. Although observational studies cannot fully account for unmeasured confounding factors, our findings suggest not only an absence of therapeutic benefit but also potential harm with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine drug regimens (with or without a macrolide) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

Although several multicentre randomised controlled trials are underway, there is a pressing need to provide accurate clinical guidance because the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine along with macrolides is widespread, often with little regard for potential risk. Some countries have stockpiled these drugs, resulting in a shortage of these medications for those that need them for approved clinical indications.10Peschken CA Possible consequences of a shortage of hydroxychloroquine for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus amid the COVID-19 pandemic.J Rheumatol. 2020;  (published online April 8.)DOI:10.3899/jrheum.200395Google Scholar The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19 using a large multinational registry to assess their real-world application. Principally, we sought to analyse the association between these treatment regimens and in-hospital death. Secondarily, we aimed to evaluate the occurrence of de-novo clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias. We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised 671 hospitals located in six continents (appendix p 3). The Surgical Outcomes Collaborative (Surgisphere Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA) consists of de-identified data obtained by automated data extraction from inpatient and outpatient electronic health records, supply chain databases, and financial records. The registry uses a cloud-based health-care data analytics platform that includes specific modules for data acquisition, data warehousing, data analytics, and data reporting. A manual data entry process is used for quality assurance and validation to ensure that key missing values are kept to a minimum. The Surgical Outcomes Collaborative (hereafter referred to as the Collaborative) ensures compliance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on real-world evidence. Real-world data are collected through automated data transfers that capture 100% of the data from each health-care entity at regular, predetermined intervals, thus reducing the impact of selection bias and missing values, and ensuring that the data are current, reliable, and relevant. Verifiable source documentation for the elements include electronic inpatient and outpatient medical records and, in accordance with the FDA guidance on relevance of real-world data, data acquisition is performed through use of a standardised Health Level Seven-compliant data dictionary, with data collected on a prospective ongoing basis. The validation procedure for the registry refers to the standard operating procedures in place for each of the four ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 27001:2013 certified features of the registry: data acquisition, data warehousing, data analytics, and data reporting. The standardised Health Level Seven-compliant data dictionary used by the Collaborative serves as the focal point for all data acquisition and warehousing. Once this data dictionary is harmonised with electronic health record data, data acquisition is completed using automated interfaces to expedite data transfer and improve data integrity. Collection of a 100% sample from each health-care entity is validated against financial records and external databases to minimise selection bias. To reduce the risk of inadvertent protected health information disclosures, all such information is stripped before storage in the cloud-based data warehouse. The Collaborative is intended to minimise the effects of information bias and selection bias by capturing all-comer data and consecutive patient enrolment by capturing 100% of the data within electronic systems, ensuring that the results remain generalisable to the larger population. The Collaborative is compliant with the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines for registries. With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, this registry was used to collect data from hospitals in the USA (that are selected to match the epidemiological characteristics of the US population) and internationally, to achieve representation from diverse populations across six continents. Data have been collected from a variety of urban and rural hospitals, academic or community hospitals, and for-profit and non-profit hospitals. The data collection and analyses are deemed exempt from ethics review. We included all patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, at hospitals participating in the registry and with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection, for whom a clinical outcome of either hospital discharge or death during hospitalisation was recorded. A positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assay of nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens, and this finding was used for classifying a patient as positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 was diagnosed, at each site, on the basis of WHO guidance.11WHOClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when novel COVID-19 disease is suspected: interim guidance.https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdfDate: March 13, 2020Date accessed: April 24, 2020Google Scholar Patients who did not have a record of testing in the database, or who had a negative test, were not included in the study. Only one positive test was necessary for the patient to be included in the analysis. Patients who received either hydroxychloroquine or a chloroquine analogue-based treatment (with or without a second-generation macrolide) were included in the treatment group. Patients who received treatment with these regimens starting more than 48 h after COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. We also excluded data from patients for whom treatment was initiated while they were on mechanical ventilation or if they were receiving therapy with the antiviral remdesivir. These specific exclusion criteria were established to avoid enrolment of patients in whom the treatment might have started at non-uniform times during the course of their COVID-19 illness and to exclude individuals for whom the drug regimen might have been used during a critical phase of illness, which could skew the interpretation of the results. Thus, we defined four distinct treatment groups, in which all patients started therapy within 48 h of an established COVID-19 diagnosis: chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide. All other included patients served as the control population. Patient demographics, including age, body-mass index (BMI), sex, race or ethnicity, and continent of origin were obtained. Underlying comorbidities (based on International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification codes) present in either the inpatient or outpatient electronic health record were collected, which included cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and history of a cardiac arrhythmia), current or previous history of smoking, history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and presence of an immunosuppressed condition (steroid use, pre-existing immunological condition, or current chemotherapy in individuals with cancer). We collected data on use of medications at baseline, including cardiac medications (angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins) or use of antiviral therapy other than the drug regimens being evaluated. The initiation of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine during hospital admission was recorded, including the time of initiation. The use of second-generation macrolides, specifically azithromycin and clarithromycin, was similarly recorded. A quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) was calculated for the start of therapy (including a scored calculation of the mental status, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) on room air was recorded, as measures of disease severity. The primary outcome of interest was the association between use of a treatment regimen containing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (with or without a second-generation macrolide) when initiated early after COVID-19 diagnosis with the endpoint of in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome of interest was the association between these treatment regimens and the occurrence of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (defined as the first occurrence of a non-sustained [at least 6 sec] or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) during hospitalisation. We also analysed the rates of progression to mechanical ventilation use and the total and intensive care unit lengths of stay (in days) for patients in each group. For the primary analysis of in-hospital mortality, we controlled for confounding factors, including demographic variables, comorbidities, disease severity at presentation, and other medication use (cardiac medications and other antiviral therapies). Categorical variables are shown as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as means with SDs. Comparison of continuous data between groups was done using the unpaired t-test and categorical data were compared using Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0·05 was considered significant. Multiple imputation for missing values was not possible because for disease and drug variables, there were no codes to indicate that data were missing; if the patient's electronic health record did not include information on a clinical characteristic, it was assumed that the characteristic was not present. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to evaluate the effect of age, sex, race or ethnicity (using white race as a reference group), comorbidities (BMI, presence of coronary artery disease, presence of congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, or COPD, current smoker, history of hypertension, immunocompromised state, and history of hyperlipidaemia), medications (cardiac medications, antivirals, and the treatment regimens of interest), and severity of illness scores (qSOFA <1 and SPO2 <94%) on the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia (using the time from admission to first occurrence, or if the event did not occur, to the time of discharge) and mortality (using the time from admission to inpatient mortality or discharge). Age and BMI were treated as continuous variables and all other data were treated as categorical variables in the model. From the model, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated for included variables to determine their effect on the risk of in-hospital mortality (primary endpoint) or subsequent mechanical ventilation or death (composite endpoint). Independence of survival times (or time to first arrhythmia for the ventricular arrhythmia analysis) was confirmed. Proportionality between the predictors and the hazard was validated through an evaluation of Schoenfeld residuals, which found p>0·05 and thus confirmed proportionality. To minimise the effect of confounding factors, a propensity score matching analysis was done individually for each of the four treatment groups compared with a control group that received no form of that therapy. For each treatment group, a separate matched control was identified using exact and propensity-score matched criteria with a calliper of 0·001. This method was used to provide a close approximation of demographics, comorbidities, disease severity, and baseline medications between patients. The propensity score was based on the following variables: age, BMI, gender, race or ethnicity, comorbidities, use of ACE inhibitors, use of statins, use of angiotensin receptor blockers, treatment with other antivirals, qSOFA score of less than 1, and SPO2 of less than 94% on room air. The patients were well matched, with standardised mean difference estimates of less than 10% for all matched parameters. Additional analyses were done to examine the robustness of the estimates initially obtained. Individual analyses by continent of origin and sex-adjusted analyses using Cox proportional hazards models were performed. A tipping-point analysis (an analysis that shows the effect size and prevalence of an unmeasured confounder that could shift the upper boundary of the CI towards null) was also done. All statistical analyses were done with R version 3.6.3 and SPSS version 26.

All included patients completed their hospital course (discharged or died) by April 21, 2020. Patients who were hospitalised during the study period without a completed course were unable to be analysed. The study cohort included 63 315 (65·9%) patients from North America, 16 574 (17·3%) from Europe, 7555 (7·9%) from Asia, 4402 (4·6%) from Africa, 3577 (3·7%) from South America, and 609 (0·6%) from Australia (details of the number of hospitals per continent are presented in the appendix, p 3). The mean age was 53·8 years (SD 17·6), 44 426 (46·3%) were women, mean BMI was 27·6 kg/m2 (SD 5·5; 29 510 [30·7%] were obese with BMI ≥30 kg/m2), 64 220 (66·9%) were white, 9054 (9·4%) were black, 5978 (6·2%) were Hispanic, and 13 519 (14·1%) were of Asian origin (appendix p 4). In terms of comorbidities, 30 198 (31·4%) had hyperlipidaemia, 25 810 (26·9%) had hypertension, 13 260 (13·8%) had diabetes, 3177 (3·3%) had COPD, 2868 (3·0%) had an underlying immunosuppressed condition, 16 553 (17·2%) were former smokers, and 9488 (9·9%) were current smokers. In terms of pre-existing cardiovascular disease, 12 137 (12·6%) had coronary artery disease, 2368 (2·5%) had a history of congestive heart failure, and 3381 (3·5%) had a history of arrhythmia. The mean length of stay in hospital was 9·1 days (SD 6·4), with an overall in-hospital mortality of 10 698 (11·1%) of 96 032. The use of other antivirals was recorded in 38 927 (40·5%) patients as treatment for COVID-19. The most common antivirals were lopinavir with ritonavir (12 304 [31·6%]), ribavirin (7904 [20·3%]), and oseltamivir (5101 [13·1%]). Combination therapy with more than one of these antiviral regimens was used for 6782 (17·4%) patients.Figure 1Study profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) The treatment groups included 1868 patients who were given chloroquine alone, 3016 given hydroxychloroquine alone, 3783 given chloroquine with a macrolide and 6221 given hydroxychloroquine and a macrolide. The median time from hospitalisation to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2 days (IQR 1–4). The mean daily dose and duration of the various drug regimens were as follows: chloroquine alone, 765 mg (SD 308) and 6·6 days (2·4); hydroxychloroquine alone, 596 mg (126) and 4·2 days (1·9); chloroquine with a macrolide, 790 mg (320) and 6·8 days (2·5); and hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, 597 mg (128) and 4·3 days (2·0). Additional details of the study cohort are provided in the appendix (pp 4–5). Demographic variables and comorbidities were compared among survivors and non-survivors (table 1). Non-survivors were older, more likely to be obese, more likely to be men, more likely to be black or Hispanic, and to have diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and a history of arrhythmias. Non-survivors were also more likely to have COPD and to have reported current smoking.Table 1Demographics and comorbidities of patients by survival or non-survival during hospitalisationSurvivors (n=85 334)Non-survivors (n=10 698)p valueAge, years53·1 (17·5)60·0 (17·6)<0·0001BMI, kg/m227·0 (5·1)31·8 (6·4)<0·0001Obese, BMI >30 kg/m222 992 (26·9%)6518 (60·9%)<0·0001SexFemale40 169 (47·1%)4257 (39·8%)<0·0001Male45 165 (52·9%)6441 (60·2%)<0·0001Race or ethnicityWhite57 503 (67·4%)6717 (62·8%)<0·0001Black7219 (8·5%)1835 (17·2%)<0·0001Hispanic4948 (5·8%)1030 (9·6%)<0·0001Asian12 657 (14·8%)862 (8·1%)<0·0001Native American1023 (1·2%)56 (0·5%)<0·0001Other1984 (2·3%)198 (1·9%)0·0019Comorbidities at baselineCoronary artery disease9777 (11·5%)2360 (22·1%)<0·0001Congestive heart failure1828 (2·1%)540 (5·0%)<0·0001Arrhythmia2700 (3·2%)681 (6·4%)<0·0001Diabetes10 963 (12·8%)2297 (21·5%)<0·0001Hypertension21 948 (25·7%)3862 (36·1%)<0·0001Hyperlipidaemia26 480 (31·0%)3718 (34·8%)<0·0001COPD2603 (3·1%)574 (5·4%)<0·0001Current smoker7972 (9·3%)1516 (14·2%)<0·0001Former smoker14 681 (17·2%)1872 (17·5%)0·45Immunocompromised2406 (2·8%)462 (4·3%)<0·0001MedicationsACE inhibitor7521 (8·8%)428 (4·0%)<0·0001Statin8506 (10·0%)739 (6·9%)<0·0001Angiotensin receptor blocker5190 (6·1%)659 (6·2%)0·75Antiviral35 189 (41·2%)3738 (34·9%)<0·0001Disease severityqSOFA <171 457 (83·7%)7911 (73·9%)<0·0001SPO2 <94%7188 (8·4%)2129 (19·9%)<0·0001Treatment groupChloroquine alone1561 (1·8%)307 (2·9%)<0·0001Chloroquine with macrolide** Macrolides include only azithromycin or clarithromycin.2944 (3·4%)839 (7·8%)<0·0001Hydroxychloroquine alone2473 (2·9%)543 (5·1%)<0·0001Hydroxychloroquine with macrolide** Macrolides include only azithromycin or clarithromycin.4742 (5·6%)1479 (13·8%)<0·0001OutcomesDe-novo ventricular arrhythmia839 (1·0%)400 (3·7%)<0·0001Non-ICU length of stay, days9·0 (6·2)9·8 (7·4)<0·0001ICU length of stay, days2·1 (3·7)9·4 (10·6)<0·0001Total length of stay, days11·1 (7·3)19·2 (14·4)<0·0001Mechanical ventilation4821 (5·6%)4533 (42·4%)<0·0001Data are mean (SD) or n (%).

Analyses using propensity score matching by treatment group are shown in the appendix (pp 15–18). The results indicated that the associations between the drug regimens and mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias were consistent with the primary analysis. A tipping point analysis was done to assess the effects of an unmeasured confounder on the findings of significance with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (appendix pp 19–20). For chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 50% in the exposed population would need to have an HR of 1·5 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. For a comparison with the observed confounders in this study, if congestive heart failure (which has an HR of 1·756) were left out of the model, it would need to have a prevalence of approximately 30% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis. Similarly, for hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 37% in the exposed population would need to have an HR of 2·0 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. Again, congestive heart failure (which has an HR of 1·756) would need to have a prevalence of approximately 50% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis, had it not been adjusted for in the Cox proportional hazards model. In this large multinational real-world analysis, we did not observe any benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (when used alone or in combination with a macrolide) on in-hospital outcomes, when initiated early after diagnosis of COVID-19. Each of the drug regimens of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide was associated with an increased hazard for clinically significant occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of in-hospital death with COVID-19. The use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in COVID-19 is based on widespread publicity of small, uncontrolled studies, which suggested that the combination of hydroxychloroquine with the macrolide azithromycin was successful in clearing viral replication.7Gautret P Lagier JC Parola P et al.Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 20.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949Google Scholar On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for these drugs in patients if clinical trial access was unavailable.12US Food and Drug AdministrationEmergency use authorization: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) EUA information.https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covidtherapeuticsDate accessed: May 15, 2020Google Scholar Other countries, such as China, have issued guidelines allowing for the use of chloroquine in COVID-19.13Gao J Tian Z Yang X Breakthrough: chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies.Biosci Trends. 2020; 14: 72-73Google Scholar Several countries have been stockpiling the drugs, and shortages of them for approved indications, such as for autoimmune disease and rheumatoid arthritis, have been encountered.10Peschken CA Possible consequences of a shortage of hydroxychloroquine for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus amid the COVID-19 pandemic.J Rheumatol. 2020;  (published online April 8.)DOI:10.3899/jrheum.200395Google Scholar A retrospective observational review of 368 men with COVID-19 treated at the US Veterans Affairs hospitals raised concerns that the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a greater hazard of death; however, the baseline characteristics among the groups analysed were dissimilar and the possibility of bias cannot be ruled out.14Magagnoli J Narendran S Pereira F et al.Outcomes of hydroxychloroquine usage in United States veterans hospitalized with COVID-19.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 23.)

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with concerns of cardiovascular toxicity, particularly because of their known relationship with electrical instability, characterised by QT interval prolongation (the time taken for ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation). This mechanism relates to blockade of the hERG potassium channel,16Traebert M Dumotier B Meister L Hoffmann P Dominguez-Estevez M Suter W Inhibition of hERG K+ currents by antimalarial drugs in stably transfected HEK293 cells.Eur J Pharmacol. 2004; 484: 41-48Google Scholar which lengthens ventricular repolarisation and the duration of ventricular action potentials. Under specific conditions, early after-depolarisations can trigger ventricular arrhythmias.9Giudicessi JR Noseworthy PA Friedman PA Ackerman MJ Urgent guidance for navigating and circumventing the QTc-prolonging and torsadogenic potential of possible pharmacotherapies for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).Mayo Clin Proc. 2020;  (published online April 7.)DOI:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.024Google Scholar Such propensity for arrhythmia provocation is more often seen in individuals with structural cardiovascular disease, and cardiac injury has been reported to occur with high frequency during COVID-19 illness.17Shi S Qin M Shen B et al.Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online March 25.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950Google Scholar,  18Guo T Fan Y Chen M et al.Cardiovascular implications of fatal outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online March 27.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017Google Scholar Furthermore, individuals with cardiovascular disease represent a vulnerable population that experience worse outcomes with COVID-19.19Bonow RO Fonarow GC O'Gara PT Yancy CW Association of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with myocardial injury and mortality.JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online March 27.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1105Google Scholar,  20Mehra MR Desai SS Kuy S Henry TD Patel AN Cardiovascular disease, drug therapy, and mortality in COVID-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online May 1.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621Google Scholar Pathological studies have pointed to derangements in the vascular endothelium and a diffuse endotheliitis noted across multiple organs in COVID-19.21Varga Z Flammer AJ Steiger P et al.Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1417-1418Google Scholar Whether patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and those that experience de-novo cardiovascular injury have a greater predilection to ventricular arrhythmias with chloroquine or its analogues remains uncertain but plausible.

Our study did not examine the QT interval but instead directly analysed the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrythmias. We showed an independent association of the use of either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias. We also note that the hazard of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias increased when the drugs were used in combination with a macrolide. In our analysis, which was dominated by patients from North America, we noted that higher BMI emerged as a risk marker for worse in-hospital survival. Obesity is a known risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.27Lavie CJ Arena R Alpert MA Milani RV Ventura HO Management of cardiovascular diseases in patients with obesity.Nat Rev Cardiol. 2018; 15: 45-56Google Scholar,  28Sanchis-Gomar F Lavie CJ Mehra MR Henry BM Lippi G Obesity and outcomes in COVID-19: when an epidemic and pandemic collide.Mayo Clin Proc. 2020;  (published online May 19.)DOI:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.05.006Google Scholar The most commonly reported arrhythmias are atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Although age, race, and BMI were predictive of an increased risk for death with COVID-19 in our analysis, they were not found to be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias on our multivariable regression analysis. The only variables found to be independently predictive of ventricular arrhythmias were the four treatment regimens, along with underlying cardiovascular disease and COPD. Thus, the presence of cardiovascular comorbidity in the study population could partially explain the observed risk of increased cardiovascular toxicity with the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, especially when used in combination with macrolides. In this investigation, consistent with our previous findings in a smaller cohort of 8910 patients,20Mehra MR Desai SS Kuy S Henry TD Patel AN Cardiovascular disease, drug therapy, and mortality in COVID-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online May 1.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621Google Scholar we found that women and patients being treated with ACE inhibitors (but not angiotensin receptor blockers) or statins had lower mortality with COVID-19. These findings imply that drugs that stabilise cardiovascular function and improve endothelial cell dysfunction might improve prognosis, independent of the use of cardiotoxic drug combinations.21Varga Z Flammer AJ Steiger P et al.Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1417-1418Google Scholar Our study has several limitations. The association of decreased survival with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment regimens should be interpreted cautiously. Due to the observational study design, we cannot exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors, although we have reassuringly noted consistency between the primary analysis and the propensity score matched analyses. Nevertheless, a cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred. These data do not apply to the use of any treatment regimen used in the ambulatory, out-of-hospital setting. Randomised clinical trials will be required before any conclusion can be reached regarding benefit or harm of these agents in COVID-19 patients. We also note that although we evaluated the relationship of the drug treatment regimens with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, we did not measure QT intervals, nor did we stratify the arrhythmia pattern (such as torsade de pointes). We also did not establish if the association of increased risk of in-hospital death with use of the drug regimens is linked directly to their cardiovascular risk, nor did we conduct a drug dose-response analysis of the observed risks. Even if these limitations suggest a conservative interpretation of the findings, we believe that the absence of any observed benefit could still represent a reasonable explanation. In summary, this multinational, observational, real-world study of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation found that the use of a regimen containing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) was associated with no evidence of benefit, but instead was associated with an increase in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and a greater hazard for in-hospital death with COVID-19. These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed.

The global community awaits the results of ongoing, well powered randomised controlled trials showing the effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 clinical outcomes. These drugs, however, might be associated with cardiac toxicity.

QTc prolongation can be associated with a specific ventricular arrhythmia called torsade de pointes, which, although often self-terminating, can degenerate into ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, leading to death. Torsade de pointes is a rare event, with an estimated annual crude incidence of 3·2 per million population; the incidence is almost doubled in women compared with men and increases with age.3Sarganas G Garbe E Klimpel A Hering RC Bronder E Haverkamp W Epidemiology of symptomatic drug-induced long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes in Germany.Europace. 2014; 16: 101-108Google Scholar Drug-induced torsade de pointes mostly occurs in the presence of several risk factors, including high drug concentration, simultaneous exposure to multiple QTc-prolonging drugs, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypokalaemia, bradycardia, or congenital long-QT syndrome, among others.4Vlachos K Georgopoulos S Efremidis M Sideris A Letsas KP An update on risk factors for drug-induced arrhythmias.Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2016; 9: 117-127Google Scholar In The Lancet, Mandeep Mehra and colleagues5Mehra MR Desai SS Ruschitzka F Patel AN Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis.Lancet. 2020;  (published online May 22.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31180-6Google Scholar report the largest observational study published to date on the effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, with or without a macrolide, in 96 032 hospitalised patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Verified data from an international registry comprising 671 hospitals in six continents were used to compare patients with COVID-19 who received chloroquine (n=1868), hydroxychloroquine (n=3016), chloroquine with a macrolide (n=3783), or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (n=6221) within 48 h of COVID-19 diagnosis, with 81 144 controls who did not receive these drugs. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was also analysed. A Cox proportional hazard model accounting for many confounding variables, including age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, other medications, and COVID-19 severity, showed a significant increase in the risk of in-hospital mortality with the four treatment regimens compared with the control group (hazard ratios [HRs] of 1·335 [95% CI 1·223–1·457] to 1·447 [1·368–1·531]). Analyses using propensity score matching by treatment group supported this result. The increased risk of in-hospital mortality was similar in men (1·293 [1·178–1·420] to 1·408 [1·309–1·513]) and women (1·338 [1·169–1·531] to 1·494 [1·334–1·672]). The incidence of repetitive ventricular arrhythmias ranged from 4·3% to 8·1% in patients treated with a 4-aminoquinoline, compared with 0·3% in the control group (p<0·0001). Despite limitations inherent to the observational nature of this study, Mehra and colleagues should be commended for providing results from a well designed and controlled study of the effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, with or without a macrolide, in a very large sample of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Their results indicate an absence of benefit of 4-aminoquinoline-based treatments in this population and suggest that they could even be harmful. It is tempting to attribute the increased risk of in-hospital deaths to the higher observed incidence of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias, given that these drugs are known to prolong QTc and provoke torsade de pointes. However, the relationship between death and ventricular tachycardia was not studied and causes of deaths (ie, arrhythmic vs non-arrhythmic) were not adjudicated. Although not all ventricular arrhythmias might have been detected, the number of deaths in the treatment groups was much greater than the number of patients who had ventricular arrhythmias. The risk of death associated with 4-aminoquinolines alone or combined with a macrolide was similar, whereas it would be expected that the combination of two QTc-prolonging drugs would increase their proarrhythmic potential.6Frommeyer G Fischer C Ellermann C et al.Additive proarrhythmic effect of combined treatment with QT-prolonging agents.Cardiovasc Toxicol. 2018; 18: 84-90Google Scholar The HRs for death were similar in men and women, whereas women have a higher sensitivity to drug-induced QTc prolongation7Darpo B Karnad DR Badilini F et al.Are women more susceptible than men to drug-induced QT prolongation?

The study therefore does not suggest that the increased risk of death with 4-aminoquinolines was due to a proarrhythmic mechanism. Another hypothesis to explain the increased risk of death with 4-aminoquinolines is that their antiviral and immunomodulatory properties could worsen COVID-19 severity in some patients. Nevertheless, the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is intriguing.

Several explanations have been advanced for this situation, from a panicking public hoarding masks to the offshoring of manufacturing and the disruption of global trade. The history of medicine suggests another factor could be considered: the progressive replacement of reusable face masks by disposable ones since the 1960s. Medicine has been transformed by consumer culture—what Life Magazine enthusiastically named “Throwaway Living” in 1955. The history of the medical mask illuminates how this vulnerability was created. Covering the nose and mouth had been part of traditional sanitary practices against contagious diseases in early modern Europe. This protection was primarily about neutralising so-called miasma in the air through perfumes and spices held under a mask, such as the plague doctors' bird-like masks. Such practices, however, had become marginal by the 18th century. Face masks, as they are used today in health care and in the community, can be largely traced back historically to a more recent period when a new understanding of contagion based on germ theory was applied to surgery. In 1867, the British surgeon Joseph Lister postulated that wound disease was caused by the germs of the microscopically small living entities that Louis Pasteur had recently described. Lister suggested eliminating germs through the use of antiseptic substances. But in the 1880s, a new generation of surgeons devised the strategy of asepsis that aimed to stop germs from entering wounds in the first place. This was a risky strategy. Hands, instruments, even the operator's exhalations were suspect now. Johann Mikulicz, head of the surgery department of the University of Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) started working with the local bacteriologist Carl Flügge, who had shown experimentally that respiratory droplets carried culturable bacteria. In response to these findings, Mikulicz started to wear a face mask in 1897, which he described as “a piece of gauze tied by two strings to the cap, and sweeping across the face so as to cover the nose and mouth and beard”. In Paris, the surgeon Paul Berger also began wearing a mask in the operating room the same year. The face mask stood for a strategy of infection control that focused on keeping all germs away, as opposed to killing them with chemicals. Such a narrowly targeted strategy was not uncontroversial. The physician Alexander Fraenkel in Berlin, for example, was sceptical about the “whole surgical costume with a bonnet, mouth mask and veil, devised under the slogan of total wound sterility”. However, masks became increasingly widespread. A study of more than 1000 photographs of surgeons in operating rooms in US and European hospitals between 1863 and 1969 indicated that by 1923 over two-thirds of them wore masks and by 1935 most of them were using masks. It was mainly the use of the mask to cover the mouth and nose (and beard) during the Manchurian plague of 1910–11 and the influenza pandemic of 1918–19 that turned the face mask into a means of protecting medical workers and patients from infectious diseases outside of the operating room. During the 1918–19 influenza pandemic, wearing a mask became mandatory for police forces, medical workers, and even residents in some US cities, although its use was often controversial. Yet in cities like San Francisco, the decline in deaths from influenza was partly attributed to the mandatory mask-wearing policies. At this point, the rationale for wearing masks moved beyond their original use in the operating theatre: they now also protected the wearer against infection. Meanwhile, masks continued to be developed in medicine. Although medical practitioners agreed on the general function of the mask, in the first decades of the 20th century they attempted to determine the most efficient type of masks and there were patents on various designs. Masks were usually made of several layers of cotton gauze, sometimes with an additional layer of impervious material, held by a metal frame. Their main goal was to prevent respiratory droplets from being transmitted from and to the wearer, as Mikulicz and Flügge had suggested for the operating theatre. Most masks were washable and the metal parts could be sterilised and “thus permit the use of the mask for a long time”, as one US inventor explained, who had a medical mask patented in 1919.

They found that masks varied greatly in the extent to which they filtered bacteria. But when used properly, some masks were considered to offer protection from infection. Medical masks started to be replaced by disposable paper masks during the 1930s and were increasingly made of synthetic materials for single use in the 1960s. By the early 1960s, there were advertisements for new kinds of filtering masks made of non-woven synthetic fibres in nursing and surgery journals. These filtering masks were all disposable. Advertisements highlighted their performance, comfort, and convenience. Unlike most traditional medical masks, these cup-shaped respirator masks fitted snugly on the face and were designed to filter incoming, not only outgoing, air, as well as to prevent the spread of droplets like traditional masks. These masks could be used only once because their synthetic fabric would deteriorate during sterilisation. The substitution of reusable masks was part of the broader transformation in hospital care towards what a hospital administrator in 1969 called a “total disposable system” that included syringes, needles, trays, and surgical instruments. In part, disposability was supposed to reduce the risk of compromising the precarious state of sterility. However, another reason for switching to disposable masks was a desire to reduce labour costs, facilitate the management of supplies, and to respond to the increased demand for disposables that aggressive marketing campaigns had created among health-care workers. Disposables were convenient, an advantage apparent to anyone “who has seen staff disentangling the tapes and reassembling autoclaved linen masks”, as a British medical researcher put it in 1980. Industry-sponsored studies found the new synthetic masks to be superior to traditional reusable cotton masks. More frequently, however, reusable masks were omitted from comparative studies. In 1975, in one of the last studies to include an industrially manufactured cotton mask, the author concluded that the reusable mask, made of four-ply cotton muslin, was superior to the popular disposable paper masks and the new synthetic respirators. He noted that “cotton fabrics may be as effective as synthetic fabrics when incorporated in a good mask design”. Some studies have suggested that washing reusable masks might increase their bacterial filtering efficiency, perhaps by tightening their fibres. In the absence of commercial cotton masks, more recent studies have only compared artisanal or homemade masks with industrially produced disposable masks, finding the latter to be superior. These results to some extent reinforced the idea that reusable masks were potentially unsafe, partly discouraging further research into well designed and industrially manufactured reusable masks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities in some countries have recommended that citizens wear masks in public under certain circumstances. In this context, a number of grassroots initiatives has emerged, typical of our participatory age, to help people sew cloth masks at home for their personal use and in some communities to supply nearby hospitals. These improvised masks typically overlook some of the design elements that were crucial for the efficiency of earlier cotton masks. Yet the public response has been enthusiastic in some places, at least as measured by the number of people viewing instructional videos. The home production of reusable masks for use in the community offers last resort solutions to some and comfort to many, but is unlikely to contribute more than marginally to solving the shortage of personal protective equipment globally. As for health-care workers and hospitals, in some settings they are experimenting with methods to sanitise disposable masks, even though they were not designed to be reused. Such an approach is a far cry from the carefully designed, manufactured, and tested reusable masks in use until the 1970s. Reusable masks were once an essential part of the medical arsenal. However, the industrial production and further research and development of reusable masks was largely halted with the transition towards disposable masks in the 1960s. Disposable masks and respirators will certainly remain an essential part of medical personal protective equipment in the future, since some of them possess specific filtration qualities designed for health-care situations. To avoid a shortage of masks during the next pandemic, one should look beyond the creation of large stockpiles of disposable face masks and consider the risks of the throwaway consumer culture applied to life-saving devices. Perhaps one day it might again be possible to say about protective face masks what medical researchers wrote in 1918: “A mask may be repeatedly washed and used indefinitely.”",2020-05-22 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

In many countries, efforts to contain COVID-19 have resulted in an economic recession, pushing millions out of their jobs, and creating previously unprecedented unemployment in many countries worldwide. In addition to the millions of people infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hundreds of thousands have died—and will die—from COVID-19. An anticipated wave of mental and behavioural problems is beginning to be documented—compounded by social and economic stressors and uncertainties—that will likely present a population health burden for months and years to come. COVID-19 has also triggered enormous displays of pro-social behaviour with neighbours coming to the aid of those isolated by the containment efforts and of support for front-line workers, including doctors, nurses, and other health-care personnel, whose responsibilities keep them at risk of infection. In the public conversation about this pandemic, an admirable empathy has been evident for those who have been affected and for those who have died from COVID-19. In some ways, the pandemic has brought populations together, generating an understanding that our health is interlinked and that we could all be at risk. That understanding made it possible, perhaps in an unprecedented way, to empathise with those with the disease and to wish them well out of a clear sense that they could also be us. Infectious diseases have always been the paradigmatic example of diseases that show how our health is interlinked. We take vaccinations and make sure our children are vaccinated both to protect ourselves and as a social good. This impulse is laudable and, indeed, useful. It has helped, for example, ensure that during this pandemic an enormous number of people worldwide have followed guidance and orders to physically distance with relatively little demonstrable social disturbance. In fact, the opposite quickly became true: in many countries social norms shifted to encourage physical distancing, casting opprobrium on those who may have flaunted physical distancing norms and expectations. Public apologies by prominent figures who were found to be flaunting these guidelines became a feature of national media coverage. And yet, it is worth reflecting on the extent to which our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been informed by an understanding that we are all in this together, that the virus does not discriminate, and that as a result it benefits us all to comply with physical distancing guidelines to protect others and ourselves. Our empathy, our capacity to envision that we too could be affected, has been a powerful tool in the public health arsenal. But, in large part, it is hard not to notice that our empathy is informed here, as it often is, by an appreciation of our own personal risk. We feel regret and feel terrible about those who are suffering, in no small part because we can imagine that suffering being our own. But is it true that this suffering is our own? Is it true that COVID-19 does not discriminate? Evidence is emerging that the effects of COVID-19, far from being indiscriminate, follow deeply entrenched patterns of health inequities, mirroring burdens of disease that are near universal. Those with resources, money, and power, often majority racial or ethnic groups, are better able to physically distance, work from home, and retain their employment. Those same groups then have lower risks of becoming infected or dying from COVID-19, probably reflecting a combination of factors, including better access to health care and a lower underlying burden of morbidity that predisposes to worse COVID-19 outcomes. It turns out that COVID-19 does discriminate, and that those who are already vulnerable—for example, the unstably housed, people on low income, those with poorer education, and individuals with less access to reliable nutritious food—are more likely to both become infected with the virus and die from COVID-19. And this is where empathy fails. Empathy in the context of health is largely predicated on our appreciating the risks of a disease because we can imagine getting the disease ourselves. When we imagine we can also be infected, we are then willing to take the steps necessary to protect ourselves—and others—from the disease. And that force has been powerful and contributed to the dramatic change in how we live and in a shutdown of large parts of the world's economy, informed by fear of a novel disease and the need to protect ourselves and others around us.

What if those efforts also result in economic consequences that are inevitably going to be borne principally by those who are vulnerable and marginalised to begin with? What if those efforts are therefore going to result in the long-term widening of health inequities, consigning many people to worse mental and physical health for years to come? How do we account for this eventuality and how do we factor this into our thinking? This calls ultimately for compassion as the animating force behind our thinking about health, and our thinking about how we go about informing the decisions we make to contain a novel threat like COVID-19. Compassion extends beyond empathy. It does not motivate our action because we too may be harmed. Compassion motivates action because the phenomena we observe are unjust, not worthy of the world we would like to live in. Martin Luther King Jr spoke often of compassion, enjoining us to see that compassion ultimately motivates not to “[fling] a coin to a beggar” but to “see that the edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring”. Compassion pushes us to understand how we have structured the world, and to ask how we can structure it better, not because we may suffer but because others are suffering and that is not how the world should be. What would such a world look like? It would be one that is grounded in the principles of justice and the equitable distribution of resources. An approach to health that is rooted in compassion would help us see beyond ourselves, and place the good of others first. A world rooted in compassion would embrace health as a public good. This means treating health the way we do parks, education, the post office, fire stations, or our environment—in essence, as a crucial piece of the global commons supported by our collective investment for the benefit of all. I recognise that this might seem theoretical, but such an approach would have concrete implications for our approach to health that can shape all our actions, be they in times of crisis, or in other times. In some respects, the current overwhelming investment in doctors and medicine has pushed a vision of health as a private commodity, something we can buy and sell, particularly in countries like the USA that do not have access to universal health care. But what we can buy—health care—can only help us after we have become sick. And what we have been buying in the time of COVID-19 is largely an approach to bludgeon an epidemic into submission, informed by strict prioritisation of the biological imperatives of viral transmission. But our focus should always have been, and more importantly should now be, on building a world that is resilient to these challenges. Our focus should be on health as a state of not being sick to begin with, grounded in an approach that balances the health of all in all our actions. We must recognise that unless we invest in the preventive conditions of health—like safe housing, good schools, liveable wages, gender equity, clean air, drinkable water, and a more equal economy—any action we take during this and any future pandemic is likely to widen entrenched health gaps. And that situation should be unacceptable to all of us. Would our approach to COVID-19 have been different were we accustomed to seeing health through the lens of compassion? I would argue yes. First, we would have long invested in the conditions that make people healthy, aiming to remove the underlying disproportionate burden of preventable illness that accrues to vulnerable populations worldwide. Second, our response to COVID-19 would be informed in equal parts by efforts to contain the spread and to mitigate how the consequences of our efforts to do so can bring about disproportionate harm to those who are removed from the decision making around this pandemic. Third, our response would recognise the global differences that characterise a world that puts the burden of disease squarely on countries with fewer resources, often driven to that condition by centuries of cross-national injustice, and would push us to redouble our efforts to do everything in our power to help those countries, perhaps before our own. Surely this moment calls for careful reflection and a reinvestment in compassion as a foundational approach to health. Calling attention to compassion in this way is not sentimental. It is pointing out a tangible good, without which health for all is impossible. In a sense, COVID-19 has shown us that a healthy person and a healthy world are the same. And healthy people and a healthy world are both strengthened immeasurably by having compassion at the heart of health.",2020-05-22 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

Long-term follow-up relies on a combination of primary disease monitoring, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) surveillance and treatment, and long-term complications, such as secondary malignancy surveillance. The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started spreading around the world in Feb 2020, presenting an unexpected challenge for transplantation services. In Italy, the first positive patient was identified on Feb 21, 2020, and as of Apr 23, 2020 more than 190 000 people have been diagnosed and over 25 000 have died. Northern Italy, where our stem cell transplantation programme is located, was rapidly overwhelmed. When the first patient with COVID-19 was diagnosed, we were faced with the dilemma of how to minimise the risk of infection while ensuring the delivery of the essential clinical care to our onco-haematological patients who received transplantation with a curative intent and were at high risk of developing clinically significant COVID-19 disease. Could we use telemedicine to follow-up patients after transplantation during the pandemic? Telemedicine can facilitate the interactions between patients, caregivers, and health-care providers, but could it be used to manage transplantation recipients, who are generally frail and have multiple comorbidities? Italy has the privilege of having a national health system (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) since 1978, which relies on three fundamental principles: universality, solidarity, and uniformity. Even though much has been discussed on the potential benefit of telemedicine in the country in the past decade, little has been implemented so far. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has urgently pushed for the need to rethink the classic model of in-person consultations. Within 48 hours from the first COVID-19 diagnosis in Italy, physicians of our long-term follow up clinic organised telephone consultations with transplantation recipients, prioritising contact on the basis of time from transplantation and known individual post-transplantation complications. The first planned telephone call focused on areas of urgent intervention: assessment of signs or symptoms of infection, GVHD, or any signs of organ damage. The suggestion of infections or GVHD symptoms was further investigated through closed-ended questions aimed at identifying warning signs: “have you had dry mouth or difficulty swallowing dry food in the past 4 weeks?”, to address potential oral GVHD; or “have you noticed a dry cough in the past two weeks?”, to address the concern about infections. When visual examination was required (ie, onset of a skin rash), voice-only calls were replaced by video consultations. The consultations were summarised in the patients' electronic medical record. We started a risk versus benefit approach, by which patients who had less than 3 months of follow-up since transplantation and no suspected COVID-19 were all assessed through in-person visits (figure). All patients with suspected COVID-19 were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by nasopharyngeal swab and then managed by a dedicated COVID-multidisciplinary team if positive, or by the transplant physicians if negative. Patients with 3 or more months of follow-up after transplantation who did not have any COVID-19 symptoms were attended via teleconsultation if they did not show signs of transplantation-related complications, while those with organ toxicity or GVHD were assessed in-person.FigurePatient distribution and decision-making flow-chartShow full captionBlue pathway=classic long-term follow-up; red pathway=COVID-19 dedicated follow-up. *Of five COVID-19-positive patients, three were hospitalised and two were followed-up via teleconsultation. †All COVID-19-negative patients were evaluated through an in-person visit.View Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) Blue pathway=classic long-term follow-up; red pathway=COVID-19 dedicated follow-up. *Of five COVID-19-positive patients, three were hospitalised and two were followed-up via teleconsultation. †All COVID-19-negative patients were evaluated through an in-person visit.

Only 20 (4%) of 465 patients who received a transplantation reported fever and respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19; 17 (85%) of 20 were tested and 5 (25%) were confirmed COVID-19 cases. These patients were treated by a dedicated multidisciplinary team with full clinical resolution. The remaining 229 (49%) of 465 patients—all with a post-transplantation follow-up of more than 2 years—were contacted by e-mail to provide disease-specific information and explain how we were re-organising visits and teleconsultations in the long-term follow-up clinic. Our next step will be to send an email survey to patients asking for feedback and preference between teleconsultations or in-person visits. We are also preparing standarised telephone questionnaires that address all possible complications post-transplantation, including physical function and quality of life, and special sections on the effect of isolation and physical distancing measures during the pandemic. The medical emergency around COVID-19 did not allow our team to discuss important aspects of teleconsultations, such as medical liability or economic compensation for such consultations. The complete definition of the legal and financial framework for this kind of programme is our next challenge. The widespread use of internet connection, smartphones, and devices facilitate access to e-Health technologies. The sponsorship of government agencies would be crucial for the success of e-Health programmes at all levels; among multidisciplinary hospital teams, patients, caregivers, and community health providers. But ultimately, it is up to health care providers to guide patients on the virtuous use of these tools to promote equitable personalised medicine. Our experience shows the feasibility of using telemedicine to maintain a long-term follow-up programme for transplantation patients. Physicians involved in this experience felt confident about the management of patients using teleconsultations, and patients—reassured that they were not left alone while in quarantine—provided positive feedback on our telemedicine approach. This framework was developed out of necessity in the context of COVID-19 but could be fostered in the post pandemic-era through an integrated model of care after transplantation. Similar teleconsultation programmes might be useful for managing patients undergoing intensive treatments in the future, such as those with acute leukemia or lymphoma.

The authors see the decision by the Indian Council of Medical Research, under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to recommend chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine in select groups of contacts at high risk as an abandonment of scientific reasoning in desperate times. We present our counterview on this issue. The safety concerns raised by Rathi and colleagues include haemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and QTc prolongation. The prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in India ranges from 0% to 10%, with heterogenous distribution and incomplete penetrance.2Kumar P Yadav U Rai V Prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in India: an updated meta-analysis.Egypt J Med Hum Genet. 2016; 17: 295-302Google Scholar Haemolysis is not clinically significant when hydroxychloroquine is administered in usual therapeutic doses to individuals with WHO class II and III glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the safety of hydroxychloroquine is well established with prolonged use. Furthermore, a routine electrocardiogram for QTc interval is not essential before hydroxychloroquine initiation in clinical practice and is not recommended in any guidelines. Decades of experience with this drug in autoimmune disorders is enough to allay these fears. Concerns have been raised regarding lack of data on efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A paucity of data is expected in the first wave of a pandemic caused by a novel virus. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have in-vitro activity against the virus.

The pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine, such as its long half-life and high lung concentration (500-times the blood concentration), are ideally suited for use as an agent for prophylaxis.7Liu J Cao R Xu M et al.Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 16Google Scholar The criticisms made by Rathi and colleagues overlook the fact that prophylactic hydroxychloroquine would be targeted to individuals at high risk rather than the general population. Projection of adverse events to the population level causes unjustified alarm. The advisory from the Indian Council of Medical Research includes a section of key considerations that address all such concerns, which have been ignored by Rathi and colleagues. In addition, the argument that there will be a shortage of the drug is not tenable. Production has been ramped up and the Government of India is supplying hydroxychloroquine to more than 50 countries, which has received widespread appreciation. We are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation pandemic, given the scale of morbidity and mortality. The frontline health-care workers are at great risk of infection; in Italy, 20% of the responding health-care workers have been infected.8The LancetCOVID-19: protecting health-care workers.Lancet. 2020; 395: 922Google Scholar A wide variety of therapeutic interventions are being tried in COVID-19 patients, without any evidence but following a prudent approach.

By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in milk from Mother 2 at days 10 (left and right breast), 12, and 13. Samples taken subsequently were negative (figure 2). Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 N peaked at 29·8 and 30·4 in whole milk and skimmed milk, respectively, corresponding to 1·32 × 105 copies per mL and 9·48 × 104 copies per mL (mean of both isolations). Since milk components might affect RNA isolation and quantification, viral RNA recovery rates in milk spiked with serial dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 stock were determined. We observed up to 89·2% reduced recovery rate in whole milk and 51·5% in skimmed milk (appendix), suggesting that the actual viral loads in whole milk of Mother 2 could be even higher than detected.Figure 1Timecourse of SARS-CoV-2 infection of two mothers with newborn childrenShow full captionAfter delivery, Mother 1 developed mild COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Mother 2 had been wearing a surgical mask since the onset of symptoms and followed safety precautions when handling or feeding the neonate (including proper hand and breast disinfection, strict washing, and sterilisation of milk pumps and tubes). However, whether Newborn 2 was infected by breastfeeding or other modes of transmission remains unclear. Further studies of milk samples from lactating women and possible virus transmission via breastfeeding are needed to develop recommendations on whether mothers with COVID-19 should breastfeed.

David Agren reports from Mexico City. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador set out to defend the country's coronavirus czsar Hugo López-Gatell on May 8, in a morning press conference. He described López-Gatell as “honest” and “humanistic”, with “a position in favour of the people, not in favour of mercantilism, which unfortunately also came to predominate during the neoliberal period in everything related to health”. López Obrador, commonly known as AMLO, was referring to the three decades before he took office. He said that in the past some doctors only “looked to enrich themselves”, and that they asked patients “what assets do you have”, rather than “what (condition) you have”. “That's not…Dr López-Gatell”, he said. Doctors quickly denounced the comments, which came as medical staff stopped wearing their uniforms in public. Health workers have been physically assailed by people considering them COVID-19 risks. Some have had bleach thrown on them. “Many of us are risking our lives treating COVID-19 and the president makes remarks that were not appropriate for a president and much less at this time”, said Asisclo de Jesús Villagómez, former president of the Mexican College of Critical Care Medicine. More than 40 medical associations issued statements on May 10 urging AMLO to apologise. It was an unprecedented rebuke from a profession careful with its public pronouncements. Mexico's Health Secretariat did not respond to an interview request from The Lancet. AMLO apologised on May 11, saying he was only speaking of some physicians. His response to accusations from former health secretaries of shortcomings in his government's response has been to raise accusations of corruption in past administrations. However, physicians report routinely paying out of pocket for supplies. Georgina Magaña, a neurointensivist in Mexico City, said she saw early stories on COVID-19 and started purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE). What has subsequently arrived only “augments” her own personal supplies, she said. Staff have protested outside public hospitals, too, over a lack of PPE. Anti-graft group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity found 219 hospitals had reported shortages—ranging from disposable gowns to N95 masks to hand gel—as of May 14. Mexico has implemented “safe-distancing” campaigns, shut schools and universities, and closed non-essential businesses. The government has urged people to “stay home”, although quarantines have not been strictly enforced. Mexico's response has relied heavily on modelling from sentinel surveillance—which reports respiratory disease information from 475 sites across the country—rather than widespread testing. “I don't think testing is a must”, López-Gatell told CNN on May 16. “We will use testing but in a carefully planned manner.” Mexico has done 0·4 tests per 1000 people, ranking last among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. “Mexico is reserving PCR just for the serious patients”, said Xavier Tello, a physician and health-care consultant. “Contacts are not being tested, identified, or traced.” Foreign media outlets have alleged that Mexico is undercounting COVID-19 deaths. López-Gatell has denied hiding any death figures and has projected the true death rate to be more than eight times higher than the officially confirmed figures—not an unusual occurrence in a pandemic, he said. Mexico started reopening in stages on May 18, beginning with 324 municipalities with no COVID-19 cases reported in the past 28 days. Public health experts asked, however, if testing had occurred in those municipalities. “They cannot know [which municipalities to open] with their sampling scheme”, said Malaquías López-Cervantes, public health professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He said sentinel surveillance could provide a national picture, but not one at the state or local level. The Health Secretariat recorded 51 633 COVID-19 cases and 5322 deaths on May 18. “We have been able to flatten the curve”, López-Gatell said on May 16. The pandemic “will lengthen, but serious cases will not overwhelm our hospital capacity”. Even with his controversial comments and COVID-19 approach, AMLO has remained popular, according to polls—and retained the support of many physicians. Esther Zurita, a general practitioner in private practice, said most people took the president's comments out of context. She backs his COVID-19 response. “Dr López-Gatell is doing a good job of communicating the strategy…It would be extremely arrogant to judge the results prematurely.”",2020-05-23 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

On April 7, 2020, it was reported that in the US city of Chicago, where the black population is roughly 30%, nearly 70% of COVID-19 deaths were in this demographic. A report released by the UK Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre on April 17, 2020, showed that 34% of patients in the UK receiving advanced respiratory support were non-white, despite the non-white population nationally being about 14%. That day, the UK Government announced a review into the impact of COVID-19 on black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities. On May 7, 2020, a provisional analysis by the UK Office for National Statistics of NHS England data suggested that, after adjustment for age, some sociodemographic characteristics, and measures of self-reported health and disability, black people were almost twice as likely as white people to have a COVID-19-related death. We don't yet have the full picture of this pandemic. Even so, teasing apart local demographics and infection patterns seems likely to explain at least a portion of the disparities seen to date. 44% of National Health Service medical staff, on the front line of virus exposure, are non-white. In London, one of the worst affected regions of the UK, white British people are in a minority according to the 2011 Census. Socioeconomic factors may well account for some of the disparities, as might racism in health care. However, other far more speculative explanations have also been offered: some medical researchers have raised the possibility that innate genetic differences between racial groups cause the virus to hit some harder than others.

It has become routine in medical research and clinical practice to categorise people by race and ethnicity. While this is no doubt important in identifying demographic groups who might be disadvantaged by unequal treatment and to spot any environmental or social patterns affecting disease prevalence, these categories are also sometimes used to guide research, diagnosis, and treatment in ways that are not necessarily useful. At worst, they may be reinforcing damaging myths about biological differences between groups. In making the case for the possibility of innate biological health differences between groups during the COVID-19 crisis, at least one researcher has pointed to the already-recognised increased risk of hypertension among black people of Afro-Caribbean descent in the UK and the USA. Hypertension is an example of a health condition that has been unambiguously racialised. It is so widely accepted as such that the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend that black patients younger than 55 years with hypertension be given calcium-channel blockers instead of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) inhibitors, which are given to non-black patients under 55 years. What justifies this distinction in treatment on the basis of race? When epidemiologist Jay Kaufman, at McGill University in Canada, and cardiologist and global expert on hypertension Richard Cooper, at Loyola University Chicago in the USA, analysed studies that claimed to see racial differences in responses to ACE inhibitors, they did not find evidence that black or white patients were significantly advantaged by different prescriptions. Their conclusion about the benefit of assigning ACE inhibitors according to race was that from “the point of view of any individual patient, this is not meaningfully better than being assigned by the flip of a coin”. Kaufman and Cooper's research affirmed what has long been known by population geneticists. Humans are a highly homogeneous species, even more so than our closest evolutionary cousin, the chimpanzee. By far the greatest source of human genetic variation is not group differences, but individual differences. This is perhaps why, for all the effort that has been poured into research to prove the long-held hypothesis that racial differences seen in hypertension have a genetic basis, scientists have not found anything consistent in our DNA to support it. More pertinently, when we talk about race we are talking about groups that are socially defined. In the USA, for instance, someone may have just one grandparent of African ancestry but be categorised as black based on appearance. It makes little sense to conduct research around the assumption that a socially defined group could exhibit a genetic difference from another socially defined group when the groups are not biologically defined to begin with. To do so defies logic. It similarly defies logic to assume that all non-white people in the UK, with their diverse geographical ancestries, are so genetically different from white people that they will as a group be more innately affected by COVID-19. We need only look to history to understand how race was constructed and how little grounding it ever had in biology. One reason counter-assumptions persist is that racial categories are such looming presences in our social and cultural lives that we can't imagine they don't have a firmer biological basis. This is not to say that group-level differences do not exist—for example, in certain genetic conditions that run in families—and indeed, such research should not be dismissed if it can yield useful insights. But it must also be remembered that where such variations are seen, they are fuzzy and marginal, and cannot be a reliable guide to the treatment of any one patient. Very often, environmental and social factors are at play rather than biological ones. In the case of hypertension, one dominant risk factor is diet, particularly salt consumption. Alongside other known social risk factors such as physical inactivity and obesity, research looking at hypertension in black Americans suggests that there might also be an association with stress, possibly including the stress associated with racial discrimination. Yet, time and again, I have seen health researchers erroneously invoke social categories as though they are biological ones. At a conference on diversity in clinical trials held in London, UK, I saw an employee from a major pharmaceutical company repeatedly refer to “Latino” as an “ancestral” group. Anyone familiar with the history of the Americas will know that this socially defined group of people with cultural ties to Latin America comprises individuals of hugely diverse ancestries. Even at a stretch it can't be considered a genetically similar group for the purposes of scientific research. Incidents like this have made me wonder whether some well intentioned but misguided medical researchers are keeping race science alive. The temptation to group people by perceived common traits is known in any other sphere of life as stereotyping. I would argue that in medicine there is also a dangerous habit of racial stereotyping. This tendency to treat people in the same social group as similar, to enter into biological essentialism, too easily glosses over the complexities and breadth of individual differences. One possible reason that race keeps being reintroduced into health research is that one of its blue-sky goals is to have personalised medicine so precise that every person's biological profile is perfectly understood, avoiding adverse drug reactions and unnecessary deaths. In the greyer real world in which we don't have all the necessary data to do this, some doctors and researchers instead turn to social categories as proxies. They work on the assumption that certain groups share certain health traits on average, allowing them to roughly gauge the medical requirements of any patient belonging to that group. It feels like a useful step on the road to personalised medicine, some might argue. In my view, it is a fudge. Our social categories have enormous power in society, in dictating how we live and how we are treated by others, but this doesn't mean they have the same significance underneath our skins. When gaps are seen between groups, we must therefore be careful about diagnosing the causes until we have clear evidence. Casual speculation helps nobody. The UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths found in 2018 that black women were five times more likely than white women to die during pregnancy and childbirth. Similar mortality rates have been seen in the USA, not only among black women but also other minorities. Some have wondered whether this might have something to do with black women's bodies being in some way more vulnerable and less able to withstand pregnancy. It has fallen on health professionals working with minority women, such as the brilliant Florida-based midwife Jennie Joseph, to show through on-the-ground work with pregnant women that, simply by improving standards of care, mortality rates can be drastically improved. It is not groups of people that are different, Joseph's work proves, but how those groups are treated. It is racism that kills, not race. Scientists are finally investigating the damaging effects of conscious and unconscious bias on patients, revealing disturbing truths about racism, sexism, and other forms of prejudice in medicine. A review of gender differences in the treatment of chronic pain in 2018 showed that women tend to be taken less seriously than men, and are more easily dismissed as over-sensitive or hysterical. A 2020 study uncovered racial disparities in dementia care in the UK, with Asian dementia patients less likely to be prescribed anti-dementia drugs than white patients. These are not easy facts to confront for doctors and medical researchers who believe they are doing their best for patients. But the persistent habit of essentialising large groups of people in medicine, I would argue, needs to be interrogated. Medical research is not helped by maintaining myths. If race is to be used as a research variable or diagnostic tool, the reasons why need to be clearly articulated and justified, to avoid a reliance on stereotypes rather than on facts.

The public health response was fast and efficient with good governance and effective health-risk communication”, she says. But Singapore's second wave of COVID-19 among migrant workers has exposed wider inequalities. Highlighting the values at the heart of her global health vision, Legido-Quigley says: “We are not doing our job properly in global health if we do not address the circumstances of vulnerable populations, especially among the millions of people that make up the world's migrant population.” Before the COVID-19 pandemic, analysis of health systems and the implications for prevention and management of key health areas including antimicrobial resistance, non-communicable diseases, and mental health were her research priorities. The pandemic has understandably refocused some of the work of her team in Singapore. As a result, she is collaborating with public health colleagues internationally to build in-country profiles of pandemic responses. “This will be crucial to help us establish best practice, and how we can learn to adapt and influence the ability of health systems to respond with appropriate public health strategies in future outbreaks and other public health emergencies”, she explains. Legido-Quigley's career journey owes much to her parents, who instilled the values of education to their five daughters during family life in Barcelona, Spain. She studied sociology at the universities of Barcelona and Reading, UK, followed by a masters in social policy at the University of Edinburgh. But it was her time as a volunteer at an HIV/AIDS hospice in South Africa around the turn of the millennium that heightened Legido-Quigley's desire to work in the academic health and policy arena. “It was a difficult and transforming experience, trying to help dying mothers and their children, before the era of access to antiretroviral therapy”, she says. She moved to London in 2002 for her PhD at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), working extensively on European health systems projects with Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health. This included an analysis of the health system impact of Spain's austerity programme. Having spent the COVID-19 lockdown back in her native country, the impact of Spain's austerity measures has been all too evident. “Any country with depleted public health infrastructure is going to struggle in responding to a pandemic, a sobering message for our future global health security”, she says. The latter part of her time at LSHTM was spent working with the school's Director Peter Piot, with a focus on policy implications of public health research, highlighted by her contributions to the 2015 Defeating AIDS—Advancing Global Health and the 2018 Future of Health in sub-Saharan Africa Lancet Commissions. Legido-Quigley's engaging and caring personality was immediately apparent to McKee, who comments: “The first thing that strikes you about Helena is her concern for others. These include the people she is researching, many of whom are on the margins of society, and her colleagues, especially her junior staff. I'm sure that this has helped her fit so easily into different cultures in Europe and Asia. But Helena is also an extremely talented researcher and has become a role model for others, especially young female health service researchers. I feel extremely privileged to have had her as my doctoral student, and to have continued working with her ever since.” With her current position being shared between the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health in Singapore and LSHTM, Legido-Quigley is collaborating with multidisciplinary teams of academics to research the health, social, and economic impacts of COVID-19 in Asia and Europe. “We are planning one such project for WHO Europe, which will include a focus on where the pandemic has greatest impact, encompassing its effects on vulnerable populations”, she explains. Her other priorities will be the consolidation of her professional passions: mentoring a younger generation of public health researchers and contributing to the women in science and global health agenda; she is currently helping to establish a network for female scientists in Asia as part of the wider global advocacy movement to improve gender equality throughout the scientific community. Legido-Quigley has recently been appointed Editor-in-Chief of Elsevier's new Journal of Migration and Health, and is planning a special issue later this year dedicated to migrant health and the impact of COVID-19. “This is incredibly exciting for me, as the health of migrants is my passion, and no other journal has its main focus on this important component of global health”, she says. Further ahead, she sees a new dialogue on global health governance as a priority, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. “How we redefine global health architecture will have enormous implications for how health systems worldwide can be resilient to future public health emergencies”, she says. Through her membership of the Council of the World Economic Forum, Legido-Quigley is in a prime position to exert her growing influence in global health and the wider sustainable development arena.",2020-05-23 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

Talha Burki reports. On May 15, 2020, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) released provisional figures on deaths involving COVID-19 in the care sector in England and Wales. From March 2 to May 1, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed or suspected in the deaths of 12 526 individuals living in care homes in the two nations. Worrying as these figures are, they only capture official notifications; when taking account of excess mortality, the situation appears even worse. In an average year, the care sector in England and Wales sees roughly 20 000 fewer deaths during March and April than have been recorded in 2020. Once COVID-19 enters a care home, it moves quickly. By the time the first patient displays symptoms, up to half the residents might already be infected. Care homes have found it difficult to obtain adequate quantities of personal protective equipment in a reasonable time, with providers tending to prioritise the National Health Service. A survey by the Alzheimer's Society found that almost half of care homes were not confident in their supply of personal protective equipment; one facility said it had started taping bags over staff members' hands, feet, and hair. There have also been difficulties in getting hold of enough tests. “People have been trying to isolate residents and manage outbreaks without knowing who had the virus; that is an incredibly difficult task”, said Adam Gordon, professor of the care of older people (University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK). According to a report by Sky News, homes had been pressured into receiving patients with COVID-19 from hospitals. Until mid-April, official advice stated that “negative tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home”. It was only on April 28 that the government stipulated that all residents and staff should be tested for the virus. “You had a situation where care homes were forced to bring in people who probably had the virus, they did not have any means of testing, and they did not have the tools to keep people safe”, points out Adelina Comas-Herrera, a research fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK. “It was a toxic combination.” The sector is already facing a staffing crisis. Pay for care home workers tends to hover around minimum wage, despite them performing a similar job to nurses. If they do not work, they do not get paid. That makes choosing to self-isolate a costly decision. The ONS noted that 9039 of the 12 526 deaths involving COVID-19 from March to April occurred within a care home, while 3444 deaths occurred within a hospital. Gordon is not surprised by the disparity. “This is a group of people who are very frail and often have multiple morbidities”, he said. “Many patients in care homes feel that they are coming to the end of their lives; they make a conscious decision not to go to hospital but to receive care within the residential facility, even if that means palliative care”. In the vast majority of registered cases, care home residents who died from COVID-19 had at least one underlying condition, most commonly dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This is hardly surprising; around 80% of residents have some kind of cognitive impairment. Patients may deteriorate so quickly that there is no time to get them to hospital; COVID-19 can kill soon after the initial appearance of symptoms. Comas-Herrera points out that even if the majority of this year's excess deaths in care homes are not directly attributable to infection with SARS-CoV-2, that does not mean they are not a consequence of the pandemic. “COVID-19 has been hugely disruptive; it has affected all aspects of care”, she said. Isolating residents may mitigate the spread of the virus, but it is associated with morbidity of its own. Care homes are built for communal living and staffed accordingly. The lack of supervision places isolated residents at increased risk of injury, particularly from falls, and their mental health might suffer. People with dementia often stop eating if they are depressed, which can hasten death. Besides, it is no small task to persuade people with dementia to stay in their rooms and maintain physical distancing. No-one wants to see caregivers resort to restraining or sedating residents. England and Wales are far from being the only countries struggling with an epidemic of COVID-19 within the care sector. The French death toll is not much smaller (12 511). Care home residents represent around a third of the total number of reported deaths from COVID-19 in England and Wales, which is in line with several countries of similar income levels. “Even nations who have done well to control the overall epidemic, such as Germany and Norway, are seeing a high proportion of deaths among people in long-term care”, said Gordon.",2020-05-23 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

Praise for the heroic work being done by health-care workers to save lives worldwide in dangerous, exhausting conditions is everywhere. But those same workers are often left unprotected by governments and systems that have failed to supply them with enough personal protective equipment (PPE), supplies, and resources to do their jobs. In April alone, there were an estimated 27 COVID-19-related health worker deaths in the USA, 106 in the UK, and 180 in Russia, with tens of thousands of infections. The actual numbers are probably much higher. But essential work extends beyond health care. Although some people have been able to shift their jobs to their homes, millions of workers have jobs that cannot be done at home—not only custodial staff and orderlies in hospitals, but also teachers and child-care workers, grocery clerks and supermarket workers, delivery people, factory and farm workers, and restaurant staff, often without adequate PPE. These people leave their homes to help maintain a semblance of normality for others, at great risk to themselves and their families. What constitutes an essential worker in the USA varies by state, but black and Latino Americans make up a large part of the essential workforce and have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In New York City, over 60% of COVID-19 deaths have been in black and Latino populations. Meat processing plants have become hotspots for transmission, with 700 new cases at a Texas plant on May 16. 81 employees at a Walmart in Massachusetts tested positive for COVID-19 on May 2. Those who would rather quit their jobs than be exposed to a dangerous work situation face a daunting prospect in the USA. 36 million people have filed for unemployment in the past 2 months and quitting a job (even one that is unsafe) would disqualify workers from unemployment insurance benefits. In the UK, 33% (10·6 million people) of the total workforce are deemed key workers according to the Office for National Statistics. Despite a government plan to pay furloughed workers 80% of their salary, many low-wage workers such as cleaners, migrant and seasonal workers, and student labourers might not be eligible. Transport staff have been particularly hard hit. In New York City, 120 employees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) have died due to COVID-19, and nearly 4000 have tested positive. The MTA changed guidance to advise wearing face masks before the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO shifted their guidance, but being exposed to the public, even with adequate PPE, presents dangers. At least 28 London bus drivers have died due to COVID-19, and a UK railway worker, Belly Mujinga, died after being spat on by a passenger who claimed to have COVID-19, leaving behind an 11-year-old daughter. The International Labour Organization has reported that 2·7 billion people—81% of the world's workforce—had been affected by lockdown measures. 61% of workers are from the informal sector, 90% of whom are in low-income and middle-income countries, and social protection measures are often inadequate, with a lack of access to health-care support and economic protections. Informal and migrant workers are likely to fall through the cracks and ensuring their safety must be a priority. Some US states are considering reopening restaurants, bars, gyms, and swimming pools, without a viable system in place to test, trace, and isolate people, and a CDC draft plan to lift the lockdown has been watered down by the Trump administration. In Germany, infection rates rose as lockdown restrictions began to ease and in the UK Boris Johnson's vague, amorphous plan to end lockdown has caused confusion and angered many. Gifted with a 2-month lockdown and a chance to lay the groundwork for a staged, successful reopening, many western leaders have instead prevaricated, shifted blame, and appear not to grasp the dangers of lifting lockdown without robust testing and mitigation strategies in place. The rush towards a premature, ill-advised end to the lockdown risks a second wave of infections that could surpass the first, and essential workers who never got a chance to isolate and consider their health during the first wave will face the greatest risk to their lives. When this pandemic has ended, we cannot allow a return to the status quo ante. We must ensure that essential workers can do their jobs safely, and that they have adequate health care and paid sick leave to safeguard their health beyond extraordinary pandemics. Essential workers are just that—essential—and by protecting their health, we protect the health and wellbeing of us all.

On the first day of the first-ever virtual World Health Assembly, held during the worst acute global health crisis since WHO's creation in 1948, Alex Azar, US Secretary of Health and Human Services, further damaged the credibility of the US Government as a constructive member of the international community. “We must be frank”, he began. What followed was an astonishing series of unsubstantiated allegations. “There was a failure by this organisation”, Azar stated. He argued that WHO had conspired with a member state (he meant China) “in an apparent attempt to conceal this outbreak”. He accused WHO of unjustly blocking Taiwan's participation at the World Health Assembly. And he said “WHO must change.” It must be more transparent and more accountable. Earlier, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus gave a forceful defence of the agency. He accepted that “we all have lessons to learn”, but argued that WHO had stood “shoulder-to-shoulder with countries”. The agency had acted quickly, Tedros said. He promised to initiate an “independent evaluation” of the global response. “The world must never be the same.” There was no need for new plans, procedures, or institutions. What mattered now was to strengthen existing mechanisms, especially national public health capacities specified in the 2005 International Health Regulations. Investing in health was a prerequisite for development. To protect the world from future pandemics, Tedros called on member states to support a stronger WHO. In the speeches that followed, countries repeatedly backed WHO and the Director-General. China stressed that it acted in a timely, open, transparent, and responsible manner. Some countries went further, denouncing the unilateral and coercive actions of the US Government.

Overnight, President Trump wrote an explosive letter to WHO's Director-General. He claimed that “the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly to the world…if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization. I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America's interests.” But the basis for his accusations is dubious at best. In his letter, President Trump reports the results of a review his administration conducted into WHO's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He wrote that “we know the following”. The first allegation he makes is that WHO “consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal. The World Health Organization failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government's official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself.” This statement is factually incorrect.

The first reports the journal published were on Jan 24, 2020. In a paper by Chaolin Huang and colleagues, the first 41 patients from Wuhan with COVID-19 were described. The scientists and physicians who led this study were all from Chinese institutions. They worked with us closely, collaboratively, and quickly to make information about this new epidemic outbreak and disease fully and freely available to an international audience. A second paper, from Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan and colleagues, also published on Jan 24, described the first scientific evidence confirming person-to-person transmission of the new virus. This report included scientists and physicians from Hong Kong and mainland China. The allegations levelled against WHO in President Trump's letter are serious and damaging to efforts to strengthen international cooperation to control this pandemic. It is essential that any review of the global response is based on a factually accurate account of what took place in December and January. It is regrettable that President Trump's letter fell short of these standards. He should retract his letter, correct the record, and withdraw his allegations against WHO.

High-income and upper-middle-income countries have borne the brunt of deaths associated with COVID-19 so far, and they are now seeing diminishing mortality rates. Countries across the world are easing lockdown restrictions. But, as this UNICEF paper outlines, for populations least affected by the disease itself, but for whom food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition are already prevalent and critical problems, the worst might be yet to come. The Global Nutrition Report launched this month, with the bleak headline finding that one in nine people is hungry or malnourished. In 2018, almost a quarter of the world's children younger than 5 years, 149·0 million children, were stunted and 7·3% (49·5 million children) were wasted. Progress over the past few years has been minimal and remains far from the 2025 global nutrition targets: to reduce childhood stunting to fewer than 100 million children and childhood wasting to 5% or less. Now, in light of current global events, tackling malnutrition is expected to become harder still. On April 20, the 2020 Global Report on Food Crises was published, describing the factors that have led to a perfect storm for a food crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the report, armed conflict remains a key driver of food insecurity in the region, disrupting agriculture and trade, blocking supply chains, and prompting mass population displacement. Exacerbating the situation since last June, unusually heavy rains have facilitated the development of locust swarms, devastating crops across east Africa. Movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 crisis are delaying delivery of pesticides and stationing of staff to address the problem. Moreover, reports indicate that, where farmers can grow crops, lockdown restrictions are regularly preventing them from transporting produce and livestock to markets, and that rice imports to sub-Saharan Africa that were intended to compensate for the shortfall have been disrupted or stopped, driving up prices of this staple food. Finally, wage losses resulting from government-imposed shelter-in-place orders are further restricting the purchasing power of many families who were already on the borderline of poverty: an African Union study has projected that up to 20 million jobs could be lost in the region due to the COVID-19 crisis. The Global Report on Food Crises estimates that 135 million people were food insecure in 2019, but more recent World Food Programme (WFP) projections indicate that, because of the economic effects of and supply chain disruptions associated with COVID-19, this number could double in 2020, to 265 million people. In announcing these projections, WFP Executive Director David Beasley warned: “if we don't prepare and act now—to secure access, avoid funding shortfalls and disruptions to trade—we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months.” Women and, particularly, children could bear the brunt of the effects of food insecurity, as well as COVID-19-associated health system disruptions. In their Article in The Lancet Global Health, Timothy Roberton and colleagues estimate the effects of these disruptions on maternal and under-5 child deaths in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. They find that even a small reduction in coverage and use of maternal and child health services could lead to 42 240 additional child deaths and 2030 additional maternal deaths per month, with worst-case scenario disruptions potentially resulting in an excess 1 157 000 child deaths and 56 700 maternal deaths over 6 months. These indirect effects will reach far beyond the disease itself, with long-term social and economic consequences for individuals and society. How can we prepare for this impending humanitarian disaster? In March, the UN set up the US$2 billion COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, to enable agencies such as WHO, UNICEF, and the WFP to provide food, water and sanitation, and vaccinations, as well as COVID-19 testing materials and medical equipment, to the most vulnerable communities. At the time of writing, it had only received 46% of the required amount. Fully funding this appeal should be an urgent priority for donors, even as they struggle with economic shocks of their own. Additionally, restrictions on transport and trade should be considered in the wider context of their potentially devastating effects on food supply chains. To paraphrase David Beasley, leaders should be acutely alert to the potential for an infectious disease pandemic to be compounded by a pandemic of undernutrition.

Interruptions in supply chains with subsequent stock-outs of antiretrovirals and closure of sexual health clinics and counselling services are already affecting the HIV response in some countries. Correspondence in this issue describes how drug shortages are affecting the HIV response in Indonesia. Many governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have responded with innovative strategies to counter the lockdown, including multimonth dispensing of antiretrovirals, online clinics and support networks, and postal testing for sexually transmitted infections. However, there have been worrying reports about countries and regions abusing the rights of key populations affected by HIV/AIDS under the pretext of COVID-19 regulations. In Egypt, Human Rights Watch (HRW) report that people with HIV are afraid to collect their antiretroviral prescriptions since government infectious disease hospitals, the only centres for HIV treatment, have been designated COVID-19 centres. Provision of HIV services by trusted NGOs has been resisted by government and multimonth prescribing is not encouraged. Also widely reported in the media is the plight of 19 young people staying at a shelter for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people in Kampala, Uganda, who were arrested, beaten, and questioned on their sexual behaviour. They were charged with disobeying COVID-19 regulations on social distancing but were not detained under Uganda's anti-homosexuality law. After 50 days detention, the charges were dropped and the 19 people were released after mounting pressure from human rights groups. Some of those detained have HIV and had no access to their medication during detention. UNAIDS have reported crackdowns against sex workers, including home raids, compulsory COVID-19 testing, arrests, and threatened deportation of migrant sex workers. Criminalised in most jurisdictions, lockdown and social distancing have decimated their livelihoods, and police harassment and criminal penalties endanger sex workers' health. Many government-led social protection schemes have excluded sex workers. Transgender populations have also been impacted by a lack of societal care in many countries. Since lockdown, there have been reports of murders of transgender people in Puerto Rico. And HRW has reported that transgender people (hijra) in Bangladesh, who are poorly provisioned for at the best of times, have little access to food and medication and there are doubts that there will be equitable distribution of emergency resources to this group. Homeless populations too have been severely affected—for example, in Minsk, Belarus, the number of homeless shelters has reduced from 11 to three, reducing the support available for this group, some of whom are living with HIV. Some governments have taken advantage of the COVID-19 emergency to pass laws blatantly penalising some key populations. Hungary passed a law to remove the right of people to change their gender and name to conform with their gender identity; and Poland fast-tracked an update to criminal law that increases the penalties for HIV exposure, non-disclosure, and transmission. UNAIDS and the European Parliament both rightly condemned the abuse of emergency powers in the two countries. Discrimination against the LGBTI community in South Korea threatens the COVID-19 response. Lauded for its approach to containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the country's tracking and tracing of people linked to an outbreak at a gay nightclub in Seoul has led to an anti-gay backlash, in a country with already entrenched homophobic attitudes. Concerns are that those affected will not get tested for COVID-19 for fear of being outed. The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the previous inequalities for key populations affected by HIV, and emergency laws have increased stigma and discrimination. As with the HIV epidemic, a human rights-based approach is the key to combatting the COVID-19 epidemic, and many lessons can be learned from the HIV experience. Countries must take effective and proportionate responses to COVID-19, but it is unacceptable that the most vulnerable in society are left behind and, in some cases, targeted and criminalised by governments and their agencies. Indeed, infringement of rights, abuse, stigmatisation, and criminalisation does nothing but alienate already vulnerable populations when their engagement with services is crucial. COVID-19 must not become a cover for the rolling back of hard won rights in the fight against HIV.

The shutdown has meant that accommodation, catering, and conference income has evaporated. A similar situation is evolving in the USA. In the 2017 fiscal year, the US higher education sector earned about US$44·6 billion in so-called auxiliary revenues, such as bookstores, halls of residence, and summer camps. The figure for this year is likely to be nearer $30 billion. Meanwhile, Australia expects its higher education sector to lose somewhere in the region of AUS$3–4·6 billion for the 2019–20 academic year. Universities worldwide have been forced rapidly to scale up online teaching, which has typically entailed unexpected expenditure. They have had to find money to continue paying their staff, as well as deep-cleaning facilities and mothballing research projects. Yet, sizeable as the losses are for the current academic year, they could easily be dwarfed by those expected next year. The economic downturn will force thousands of youngsters to defer entering university. More than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April 2020 alone. Students from outside the UK and EU contribute about £6·9 billion in yearly fees to British universities. Encouraged by successive governments, who wished to bolster commercial education, institutions have come to rely on this money, which represents about a third of the total income from tuition fees. A collapse in the international student market, which seems inevitable, would have serious consequences. Australia is similarly exposed. Its higher education sector hosts more 300 000 students from overseas. Terry Hartle (Vice-President of the American Council on Education, Washington, DC, USA) expects international enrolments in US universities and colleges to fall by at least a quarter in 2020–21. Prospective students might also be put off by the physical distancing requirements that are likely to prevail on university campuses for the foreseeable future. Much will depend on the dynamics of the pandemic. “We really do not have a handle on what will happen when it comes to September”, said Hartle. “Very few schools in the USA are certain that they will be able to open on time.” The shift to online learning looks set to continue at least until the advent of a successful vaccine for COVID-19. This situation raises questions about whether institutions can justify a fee structure predicated on a model of face-to-face contact. “Students generally report that university is much more than just tuition—place is also really important”, said Simon Marginson (Professor of Higher Education at the University of Oxford, Oxford, UK). “If students are going to miss half of what usually constitutes the student experience, are they really receiving the same value for money?” Furthermore, online learning is no substitute for laboratory work. Moreover, recessions diminish the prospects for graduate employment. “You have a downgrading of the student experience and a downgrading of the value of the degree; I think it is going to be difficult for universities to sustain the same level of fees that they have been”, said Marginson. It could easily add up to a perfect storm: weakening of domestic and international demand coupled with pressure to decrease fees. “Without any action, universities will be forced to make huge cuts, jobs will be lost, and vital research will be halted”, a spokesperson for Universities UK, an umbrella group representing 137 institutions, told The Lancet Oncology. “Pretty much every university in the country is looking at voluntary redundancies”, added Malcolm Reed (Dean of Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK, and Co-Chair of the Medical Schools Council, London, UK). “A lot of staff on short-term contracts are likely to go, and funding for PhDs is looking very precarious because of the impact on charities; our pool of future researchers is going to be shallower.” Prestigious research institutions, such as Harvard (Cambridge, MA, USA) or Oxford (UK) universities, are well placed to weather the coming storm. But places that fall lower down the league tables are vulnerable, especially if international student fees form a big part of their income. “For the most part, medical schools and high-quality research will be ring-fenced from changes”, said Marginson. “Medicine and life sciences are very strong in the UK system; I am confident that they will survive when other things go down”. Much will depend on the depth of the downturn. Reed points out that medical schools are integrated within the university's wider economy. “If the university is under threat, so is the medical school”, he said. Clinical placements for UK medical students in their penultimate year have been suspended since March. Reed hopes that if they are able to restart by September, the lost ground can be recovered. But any further delay would be problematic. “There is no simple answer as to how to deal with students who have missed 6 months of their clinical experience”, said Reed. “It would be a real threat to graduating on time next year”. As The Lancet Oncology went to press, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide was approaching 5 million. In the absence of substantial financial support, many of the world's colleges and universities are unlikely to survive the pandemic. Others will have to shut down large projects or sell property. “This is an epochal event”, said Hartle. “It is going to leave a huge impression on the education sector.” View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Ruth Swan/Shutterstock.com View Large                                            Image                                                                        Copyright                                © 2020 Ruth Swan/Shutterstock.com",2020-05-21 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

Anakinra is an immunosuppressive drug that carries the theoretical risk of harm in the wrong patient group by potentially targeting beneficial inflammation; however, positive effects might also be missed if the correct patient group is not ascertained. It is important, therefore, to target treatment to individuals considered to have hyperinflammation. Diagnostic criteria in this patient group are poorly developed and there is no consensus, as seen from the inclusion criteria listed for the ongoing anakinra trials (table). Although serum ferritin and IL-6 concentrations are highly specific to hyperinflammation and have been shown to be associated with a need for ventilation in patients with COVID-19,8Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (401)Google Scholar they are not routinely measured in the clinical setting, a shortcoming that is highly relevant given the requirement to identify as many patients as possible that might benefit. We suggest a pragmatic approach to patient selection based on identifying patients with progressive disease and evidence of increasing inflammation. Therefore, we propose using worsening lymphopenia, a marker of disease progression and severity in COVID-19, and increasing C-reactive protein as evidence of worsening inflammation. The dose and route of administration of anakinra is especially relevant given its short plasma half-life, with both intravenous and subcutaneous routes being considered.6Aouba A Baldolli A Geffray L et al.Targeting the inflammatory cascade with anakinra in moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia: case series.Ann Rheum Dis. 2020;  (published online May 6.)DOI:10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217706CrossrefGoogle Scholar,  7Cavalli G De Luca G Campochiaro C et al.Interleukin-1 blockade with high-dose anakinra in patients with COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and hyperinflammation: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet Rheumatology. 2020;  (published online May 7.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2665-9913(20)30127-2SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFGoogle Scholar While a short half-life is beneficial in limiting the drug's duration of action in case of adverse events, it also leads to large peak–trough fluctuations with an intravenous formulation. Variation in dosing needs to be minimised to ensure constant and adequate bioavailability, and to avoid a detrimental rebound increase of inflammation. Pharmacokinetic studies in various disease states have shown that subcutaneous anakinra might ensure adequate and consistent plasma concentrations, with bioavailability ranging from 80–95%.9Yang BB Baughman S Sullivan JT Pharmacokinetics of anakinra in subjects with different levels of renal function.Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2003; 74: 85-94CrossrefPubMedScopus (57)Google Scholar,  10Yang BB Gozzi P Sullivan JT Pharmacokinetics of anakinra in subjects of heavier vs. lighter body weights.Clin Transl Sci. 2019; 12: 371-378CrossrefPubMedScopus (0)Google Scholar Concerns have been raised regarding the suitability of subcutaneous drug administration in patients in intensive care because they are susceptible to the development of peripheral oedema and poor skin perfusion. Repeated subcutaneous injections might also lead to patient discomfort. However, these downsides should be weighed against the considerable benefits of subcutaneous administration in the context of this pandemic, which include easy administration by any health-care professional, increased cost-effectiveness with no need for infusion pumps or equivalent, and reduced fluid load. Reduced fluid load is important as current guidelines for management of severe ARDS recommend a negative fluid balance of 0·5–1·0 L per day,11Matthay MA Aldrich JM Gotts JE Treatment for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19.Lancet Respir Med. 2020; 8: 433-434SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (9)Google Scholar and the most commonly adopted mode of intravenous anakinra results in infusion of a minimum of 400 mL of fluid. Another important consideration is the choice of how to record the success (or otherwise) of the intervention. It is rare for single trials to provide definitive answers, so a core set of outcomes that are reported by all trials of a given intervention are important to allow systematic reviewers to combine results in similar patient populations.12Williamson PR Altman DG Bagley H et al.The COMET handbook: version 1·0.Trials. 2017; 18: 280CrossrefPubMedScopus (0)Google Scholar Of the ten identified trials (table), six trials consider patients with a severe condition. These trials are dominated by the REMAP-CAP trial (NCT02735707), which has an open-ended recruitment and a target of 7100 patients. The other five trials have a total of fewer than 400 participants receiving anakinra, with no outcome common to all. Some trials focus on effectiveness (clinical) and others on efficacy (biomarker) endpoints. The other four trials include patients with less severe disease but who are hospitalised, with total recruitment around 250 participants. These trials have a similar mix of effectiveness and efficacy endpoints, with mortality being the most commonly reported outcome. Only five trials explicitly mention ferritin as an outcome, which is regarded as an important parameter for assessing hyperinflammation, and these trials will report data in different ways that will preclude pooling. Even without the clinical heterogeneity inherent in the range of eligibility criteria and dosing regimens under study (table), power for meaningful meta-analysis will be low. Anakinra is a highly plausible drug candidate in COVID-19, but we encourage trialists to consider patient selection, dosing, and outcome measures, and, importantly, to ensure collection of core outcome measures for current and future trials.

These organoids were used to study diseases such as cystic fibrosis and lung tumours, and infections.3Sachs N Papaspyropoulos A Zomer-van Ommen DD et al.Long-term expanding human airway organoids for disease modeling.EMBO J. 2019; 38: 1-20CrossrefScopus (0)Google Scholar One study4Hui KPY Ching RHH Chan SKH et al.Tropism, replication competence, and innate immune responses of influenza virus: an analysis of human airway organoids and ex-vivo bronchus cultures.Lancet Respir Med. 2018; 6: 846-854SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (11)Google Scholar used airway organoids to look at viral replication, tissue tropism, and immune response to many human influenza A and avian viruses. Fortunately, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, was isolated and propagated early on in the pandemic using numerous in-vitro models, such as Vero cells, Huh7 cells, and human airway epithelial cells. This isolation was enhanced after SARS-CoV-2 was isolated and propagated in TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells, indicating the vital role of TMPRSS2 serine protease in virus infectivity.5Matsuyama S Nao N Shirato K et al.Enhanced isolation of SARS-CoV-2 by TMPRSS2-expressing cells.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020; 117: 7001-7003CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Thus, in-vitro models are effective in the study of virus propagation, but they poorly recapitulate respiratory tract histology and function. We recommend the use of human airway organoids as a model to study SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics, tropism, and host response (figure). Airway organoids can be generated using healthy lung tissue derived from patients undergoing surgical resection, and SARS-CoV-2 can be obtained from clinical specimens from patients who have tested positive. After the airway organoid is infected with SARS-CoV-2, immunofluorescence and electron scanning microscopes could be used to study the cytopathic effects of viral particles on different cell types. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR could determine viral replication kinetics and genetic alterations, and transcriptomic profiling could reveal the differential expression of genes related to viral infection. Additionally, flow cytometry enables the detection and quantification of different cell types before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.FigureCo-culture of airways organoidsShow full captionCo-culture of airways organoids with SARS-CoV-2 could be used to study viral replication, tropism, and pathogenicity in addition to structural changes (A); study immune responses and cytokine release, recapitulate some pathological conditions such as cytokine release syndrome, and develop immunomodulatory drugs (B); and as a tool for antiviral drug discovery and development (C).

Airway organoids could also be used in a co-culture model and be cultured with different immune cells. This co-culture model would enable the study of immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, genomic and transcriptomic profiling could reveal further signalling pathways involved in such immune responses. It is also possible to detect the secreted cytokines in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and hence provide a model to recapitulate cytokine release syndrome seen in some patients with COVID-19.8Shi Y Wang Y Shao C et al.COVID-19 infection: the perspectives on immune responses.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27: 1451-1454CrossrefPubMedScopus (11)Google Scholar Moreover, a co-culture model could be used to explore the activity of immunomodulatory drugs. Airway organoids could also be used to discover effective antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19. The potential activity of drug candidates could be predicted by several laboratory methods: real-time quantitative PCR can assess viral load, while immunofluorescence and electron microscopy can identify the number of cells that have been infected. Additionally, microarray analyses can identify the molecular mechanisms of investigational drugs and their possible cellular targets. Models using airway organoids could be invaluable to learn more about SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, replication kinetics, and host–virus interactions, an understanding of which will be key to help fight the current pandemic.

However, randomised clinical trials for both therapies have since failed to show benefit.2van Griensven J Edwards T de Lamballerie X et al.Evaluation of convalescent plasma for Ebola virus disease in Guinea.N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 33-42CrossrefPubMedScopus (137)Google Scholar,  3The PREVAIL II Writing GroupA randomized, controlled trial of ZMapp for Ebola virus infection.N Engl J Med. 2016; 375: 1448-1456CrossrefPubMedScopus (191)Google Scholar Why, then, did so many more Americans survive if not due to preferential access to experimental therapies? The likely answer is the Americans survived not due to preferential access to unproven therapies but to proven ones. 5 years later, the world is facing another, much larger, pandemic, and we worry the medical community has not learned from this recent experience. To be clear, searching for effective new therapies against COVID-19 is highly important. At the same time, we must remain cognisant that the odds are stacked against the candidates. Medications that decrease mortality are difficult to come by, leaving numerous diseases without direct remedies. Influenza provides an important perspective. Scientists have been searching for a cure since before the 1918 influenza pandemic, and more than 100 years later our best medicines for influenza merely shorten the duration of symptoms by a day at best.4Jefferson T Jones MA Doshi P et al.Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in adults and children.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014; 4CD008965PubMedGoogle Scholar None has been shown to reduce mortality. Influenza is not unique; sepsis has been subjected to decades of research resulting in a much advanced understanding of the syndrome's pathobiology. However, hundreds of therapeutic candidates with biological plausibility, from stem cells to vitamin C, have not consistently improved patient outcomes. Of course, a lack of targeted therapies does not mean a patient with the 1918 influenza would not fare better today, or that someone with sepsis is not better off in 2020 than before the Surviving Sepsis campaign of 2002. Just like the Americans evacuated home during the Ebola epidemic, access to modern medicine's supportive care toolbox—frequent laboratory assessments with correction of metabolic derangements, precise haemodynamic monitoring and support, lung protective mechanical ventilation, and dialysis, among others—would have saved countless lives. Although these everyday interventions have not received the same attention as novel therapeutic strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, their value is informed by decades of evidence. As with influenza, Ebola, and sepsis, the timely delivery of standard and supportive care will probably save more patients from COVID-19 in the months ahead than any of the unproven, and potentially dangerous, pharmacological therapies being both formally trialled and individually tried today. Hydroxychloroquine, for example, was widely used early in the pandemic on the basis of reports of a potential benefit. More recent assessment has called its use into question and even suggested harm. Rather than ruminating about which innovative therapeutic might help a given patient, our collective mental energy is better spent on guaranteeing the delivery of evidence-based care against COVID-19's main killers. In 2000, the ARDS Network discovered that use of small tidal volumes reduced absolute mortality by 9%—the first intervention shown to improve outcomes since acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first described 33 years earlier.5The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome NetworkVentilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with traditional tidal volumes for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.N Engl J Med. 2000; 342: 1301-1308CrossrefPubMedScopus (7881)Google Scholar Subsequent trials have shown an additional 17% absolute risk reduction for patients with moderate and severe ARDS when managed in the prone position.6Guérin C Reignier J Richard J-C et al.Prone positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.N Engl J Med. 2013; 368: 2159-2168CrossrefPubMedScopus (1122)Google Scholar Furthermore, a conservative fluid management strategy can decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation and onset of other organ dysfunction.7The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials NetworkComparison of two fluid-management strategies in acute lung injury.N Engl J Med. 2006; 354: 2564-2575CrossrefPubMedScopus (2068)Google Scholar Other strategies have been shown to prevent ARDS, including the conservative use of blood products, early identification and treatment of sepsis, default use of lung protective ventilation, and intensivist involvement. Despite these decades of data and agreed-upon standard of care for ARDS, many have suggested—via journal articles, medical blogs, news sites, and social media—that several of these standards should be abandoned in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19. It has been argued that COVID-19 causes a form of ARDS which is different from what is claimed to be traditional or typical ARDS and therefore should be treated differently. The evidence supporting these claims is poor or absent. For example, a common refrain is that patients with ARDS from COVID-19 have higher lung compliance and worse oxygenation than traditional ARDS. However, published compliance data from patients with ARDS from COVID-19 are largely consistent with data from ARDS trials predating the pandemic. Furthermore, the few published and preprint tissue analyses available from both biopsy and autopsy specimens show diffuse alveolar damage as is typically seen in ARDS from other causes. Similarly, while much attention has been paid to the presence of extensive pulmonary microthrombosis in patients with ARDS from COVID-19, the same observation was made in ARDS more than 30 years ago. It is certainly possible, and perhaps even likely, that ARDS from COVID-19 has unique features, just as ARDS from pneumonia, pancreatitis, and gastric aspiration probably have unique features. By definition ARDS is a syndrome, not a disease. While disentangling subtypes of ARDS is an active and promising field, the bulk of clinical trial data to date come from patients with ARDS of varying causes, including viral pneumonias. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, proven therapies for ARDS (low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and conservative fluid strategy) should remain the standard of care for all patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. As clinicians caring for patients dying from COVID-19, we too yearn for a novel therapy for this novel disease. We also recognise and appreciate the scientific value of expert observations. Indeed, they are crucial to identify aspects of management where there truly is equipoise and thus indication for rigorous study. Prompt collection of such data must be prioritised so we will be armed with appropriate evidence to fight the inevitable second surge when it arrives. History tells us a pandemic is not a justification to abandon the basic principles of evidence-based medicine. In fact, adhering to these values has never been more important.

First, people are currently more able than in the past to talk about depression, anxiety, and suicide ideation. It appears that sharing experiences of negative emotions carries less stigma than it used to. Moreover, death has become a topic that all ages can more readily talk about, and it might be easier for people and mental health providers to ask directly about suicide risk. Second, people now understand the importance of social support in times of crises and tend to agree that it saves lives. Finally, people at risk for suicide can now get psychological help online, which might be more accessible for various reasons (eg, because of reduced stigma and removal of transportation or time barriers). The medical community needs to make sure that online providers can assess suicide risk and provide specific suicide prevention interventions.5Stanley B Brown G Safety planning intervention: a brief intervention to mitigate suicide risk.Cogn Behav Pract. 2012; 19: 256-264CrossrefScopus (280)Google Scholar Mental health providers should now directly convey to every patient that in any case of severe crises, they should not hurt themselves.

We depend on their health and wellbeing so that they can continue to provide care to individuals, families, and communities with and without COVID-19. The reasons people attack and abuse health-care personnel during health emergencies are many, and local contexts vary. In some settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, fear, panic, misinformation about how SARS-CoV-2 can spread, and misplaced anger are likely drivers.

First, collect data on the incidence and types of attacks on health-care personnel, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in all countries to fully understand the scope of the problem and to design interventions to prevent and respond to the attacks. National and international bodies such as WHO must engage in a coordinated global effort.

Local and state governments must partner with civil society, community-based groups, and media organisations to highlight the problem of attacks on health-care workers and engage with the community on prevention, bystander intervention, and reporting. The Health Care in Danger team of the International Committee of the Red Cross, for example, recently published a checklist for preventing violence against health-care workers in the COVID-19 response, which includes recommendations for communication and collaboration.13International Committee of the Red CrossSafer COVID-19 response: checklist for health-care services.https://healthcareindanger.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4469_002_Safer_COVID-19_Response-Checklist_for_Health-care_Services-Lr_1.pdfDate: May, 2020Date accessed: May 16, 2020Google Scholar Third, misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 must be countered. Widespread misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19, including conspiracy theories, have contributed to the demonisation of certain groups such as health-care workers.14Beaumont P Borger J Boffey D Malicious forces creating “perfect storm” of coronavirus disinformation.The Guardian. April 24, 2020; Google Scholar Governments, international collaborative bodies, and social media companies must further refine and expand effective public information campaigns to keep members of the public informed and educated and to correct misinformation. These should include clear and concise information on how SARS-CoV-2 is and is not spread and the science behind response measures. In the face of high levels of community distrust in many places, active engagement of key trusted community stakeholders and organisations in information campaigns will also be essential for success. Fourth, accountability is needed. We must demand strong yet responsible enforcement actions against perpetrators of attacks by local and national governments. Violence against health-care personnel should be met with swift responses from law enforcement and legal systems. Local law enforcement authorities must fully investigate each reported incident, with an objective, evidence-based process. Full accountability for these crimes must be ensured and perpetrators must be held accountable. Fifth, state and local governments should invest in health security measures to protect health-care workers as part of COVID-19 emergency budgets. Funding for the protection of health-care personnel and health facilities is needed now. Finally, health professional associations, societies, and organisations from all specialties and disciplines should unite in speaking out forcefully against all acts of discrimination, intimidation, and violence against health-care workers.15International Council of NursesICN calls for government action to stop attacks on nurses at a time when their mental health and wellbeing are already under threat because of COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.icn.ch/news/icn-calls-government-action-stop-attacks-nurses-time-when-their-mental-health-and-wellbeingDate: April 29, 2020Date accessed: May 3, 2020Google Scholar They must immediately condemn violence when it occurs and participate in initiatives aimed at responding to and eliminating violence. These actions must be taken now. By protecting health-care personnel, we protect our most valuable assets in the fight against COVID-19: doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians, medical and respiratory technicians, laboratory workers, and many others on the front lines. We declare no competing interests.

Many factors could have a role in this disparity, including differences in proportion of elderly people in a population, general health, accessibility and quality of healthcare, and socioeconomic status. One mostly overlooked factor that could influence outcome of COVID-19 is the relative vitamin D status of populations. Because people are advised to stay at home as much as possible, the government health agencies of Great Britain have recommended that people take vitamin D supplements through summer and autumn during this pandemic. Vitamin D supplementation could be especially important for older people as they are at high risk of poor outcome from COVID-19 and of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D has a well-characterised role in calcium and phosphate balance, affecting bone growth and turnover. Low vitamin D status is also associated with other non-communicable diseases and with increased susceptibility to infectious disease; notably, upper respiratory tract infections. However, whether low vitamin D levels are a cause or consequence of disease has remained a point of heated debate. Intervention trials have rarely shown benefits of vitamin D supplementation as treatments or preventive measures. However, one important exception to this general trend is for upper respiratory tract infections: a 2017 meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 321 participants in 25 randomised controlled trials showed that vitamin D supplementation protected against acute respiratory tract infections and that patients with very low (<25 nmol/L) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (a marker of vitamin D status) gained the most benefit. A growing body of circumstantial evidence now also specifically links outcomes of COVID-19 and vitamin D status. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, emerged and started its spread in the Northern hemisphere at the end of 2019 (winter), when levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are at their nadir. Also, nations in the northern hemisphere have borne much of the burden of cases and mortality. In a cross-sectional analysis across Europe, COVID-19 mortality was significantly associated with vitamin D status in different populations. The low mortality rates in Nordic countries are exceptions to the trend towards poorer outcomes in more northerly latitudes, but populations in these countries are relatively vitamin D sufficient owing to widespread fortification of foods. Italy and Spain are also exceptions, but prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in these populations is surprisingly common. Additionally, black and minority ethnic people—who are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency because they have darker skin—seem to be worse affected than white people by COVID-19. For example, data from the UK Office for National Statistics shows that black people in England and Wales are more than four times more likely to die from COVID-19 than are white people. A role for vitamin D in the response to COVID-19 infection could be twofold. First, vitamin D supports production of antimicrobial peptides in the respiratory epithelium, thus making infection with the virus and development of COVID-19 symptoms less likely. Second, vitamin D might help to reduce the inflammatory response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Deregulation of this response, especially of the renin–angiotensin system, is characteristic of COVID-19 and degree of overactivation is associated with poorer prognosis. Vitamin D is known to interact with a protein in this pathway—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)—which is also exploited by SARS-CoV-2 as an entry receptor. While SARS-CoV-2 downregulates expression of ACE2, vitamin D promotes expression of this gene. Rose Anne Kenny (Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin, Ireland) led the cross-sectional study into mortality and vitamin D status and is the lead investigator of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). She is adamant that the recommendations from all public health bodies should be for the population to take vitamin D supplements during this pandemic. “The circumstantial evidence is very strong”, she proclaims regarding the potential effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Adding, “we don't have randomised controlled trial evidence, but how long do you want to wait in the context of such a crisis? We know vitamin D is important for musculoskeletal function, so people should be taking it anyway”. Kenny recommends that, at the very least, vitamin D supplements are given to care home residents unless there is an extremely good reason not to do so. Adrian Martineau (Institute of Population Health Sciences, Barts and The London, Queen Mary University of London, UK), lead author of the 2017 meta-analysis has joined with colleagues from universities around the UK to launch COVIDENCE UK, a study to investigate how diet and lifestyle factors might influence transmission of SARS-CoV-2, severity of COVID-19 symptoms, speed of recovery, and any long-term effects. They aim to recruit at least 12 000 people and to obtain interim results by the summer. Despite his enthusiasm for the study, Martineau is pragmatic: “At best vitamin D deficiency will only be one of many factors involved in determining outcome of COVID-19, but it's a problem that could be corrected safely and cheaply; there is no downside to speak of, and good reason to think there might be a benefit”.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on May 8, 2020, for clinical trial reports with the terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, and “clinical trial” and no date or language restrictions; no other data from a human clinical trial of COVID-19 vaccine have been reported thus far, to our knowledge. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for unpublished trials of COVID-19 vaccines, up to May 6, 2020. In addition to the adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine reported here, seven candidate COVID-19 vaccines are in ongoing clinical trials, including Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Inovio Pharmaceuticals' DNA vaccine, Sinovac, Wuhan and Beijing Institute of Biological Products' inactive COVID-19 vaccines, University of Oxford's chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, and BioNTech's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.Added value of this studyThis first-in-human trial showed that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerable and immunogenic in healthy adults. One dose of the vaccine at all dose concentrations (5 × 1010, 1 × 1011, and 1·5 × 1011 viral particles) tested induced both specific antibody and T-cell responses in most participants. Rapid specific T-cell responses were noted at day 14 and specific humoral responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination. Although we found that the high dose vaccine tended to be more immunogenic than the middle dose and low dose vaccines, it was also associated with a higher reactogenicity. Severe fever, fatigue, dyspnoea, muscle pain, and joint pain were reported in some of the recipients in the high dose group.Implications of all the available evidenceMany vaccine candidates are in rapid development, including recombinant-protein based vaccines, replicating or non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines (which mostly have focused on the spike glycoprotein or receptor binding domain), live attenuated vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines. All of these vaccine platforms have advantages and disadvantages, and it is too soon to predict which will be more successful.

We did a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, dose-escalation phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate in a rehabilitation centre in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Eligible participants were healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years, who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by negative results of serum specific IgM and IgG antibodies with a commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid test kit (Jinwofu, Beijing, China), negative nucleic acid for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs or sputum and anal swabs detected with a nucleic acid diagnostic kit (PCR-fluorescence probing, Sansure Biotech, Changsha, China), and a clear chest CT image with no evidence of lesions in the lungs at the time of screening. Exclusion criteria were a history of seizures or mental illness; allergy to any ingredient included in the vaccine; acute febrile disease on the day of enrolment; receipt of any blood products in the past 4 months; receipt of any research medicines or vaccine in the past month; and being unable to comply with the study schedule.

The administration of higher dose injections and new enrolment were paused if any criteria for pausing dose escalation were met. The protocol and informed consent were approved by the institutional review board of the Jiangsu Provincial Center of Disease Control and Prevention. Written informed consent from all participants was obtained before screening. This study was undertaken by Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was developed by Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Beijing, China) and CanSino Biologics (Tianjin, China). The vaccine is a replication defective Ad5 vectored vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. We cloned an optimised full-length spike gene based on Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number YP_009724390) with the tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide gene into an E1 and E3 deleted Ad5 vector, and constructed the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine using the Admax system from Microbix Biosystem (Toronto, ON, Canada). The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was manufactured as a liquid formulation containing 5 × 1010 viral particles per 0·5 mL in a vial. A single shot was allocated intramuscularly in the arm of the participants in the low dose group, with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (5 × 1010 viral particles per 0·5 mL). The participants in the middle dose group received one shot intramuscularly in the arm with two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (1 × 1011 viral particles per mL). Participants in the high dose group received a double-shot regimen with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in one arm and two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in the other arm (1·5 × 1011 viral particles per 1·5 mL). Adverse events were self-reported by the participants, but verified by investigators daily during the first 14 days after vaccination. Subsequently, adverse events were recorded by the participants on diary cards in the following weeks. Laboratory safety tests including white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophils, platelets, haemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine were measured on day 7 to assess any toxic effects post-vaccination. We graded adverse events and abnormal changes in laboratory tests according to the scale issued by the China State Food and Drug Administration (version 2019).11National Medical Products Administrationhttp://www.nmpa.gov.cn/WS04/CL2138/373037.htmlDate: 2019Date accessed: May 20, 2020Google Scholar Blood samples were taken from participants for serology tests at the scheduled site visits before the vaccination, and on days 14 and 28 after the vaccination. We assessed binding antibody responses against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike glycoprotein with ELISA kits manufactured by Beijing Wantai BioPharm (Beijing, China). A dilution of 1:40 was the positivity cutoff value for ELISA. We also measured the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination using both live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation (virus strain SARS-CoV-2/human/CHN/Wuhan_IME-BJ01/2020, GenBank number MT291831.1) and pseudovirus neutralisation tests (a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirus system expressing the spike glycoprotein).12Nie J Li Q Wu J et al.Establishment and validation of a pseudovirus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2.Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020; 9: 680-686Google Scholar Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood before the vaccination and at days 14 and 28 post-vaccination. Specific T-cell responses were quantified with an interferon (IFN) γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptide pools for about 12–24 h before detection, and expressed as the number of spot-forming cells per 100 000 cells. All measurements were subtracted from the unstimulated control values, and minus values were corrected to zero. The results were considered positive if there was at least a two-times increase in the number of IFNγ secreting T cells post-vaccination. We also assessed the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to vaccination according to the secretion of IFNγ, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), which were measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after the stimulation with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptide pools for about 6 h and detected by flow cytometry. Similar methods to measure T-cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining assays have been reported previously.13Ewer K Rampling T Venkatraman N et al.A monovalent chimpanzee adenovirus Ebola vaccine boosted with MVA.N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 1635-1646Google Scholar,  14De Santis O Audran R Pothin E et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine in healthy adults: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 1/2a study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2016; 16: 311-320Google Scholar The pre-vaccination and post-vaccination anti-Ad5 neutralising antibody titres were detected with a serum neutralisation assay.15Sprangers MC Lakhai W Koudstaal W et al.Quantifying adenovirus-neutralizing antibodies by luciferase transgene detection: addressing preexisting immunity to vaccine and gene therapy vectors.J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41: 5046-5052Google Scholar We analysed all outcomes in the intention-to-treat cohort. The primary endpoint for safety was the occurrence of adverse reactions within 7 days after the vaccination. Any abnormal changes in laboratory measures at 7 days post-vaccination, and adverse events within 28 days across the treatment groups were also analysed as secondary safety endpoints. The specific ELISA antibody titres to RBD and the spike glycoprotein, and the neutralising antibody amounts against live SARS-CoV-2 and a pseudovirus were measured as humoral immunogenicity endpoints. We defined a positive antibody response (seroconversion) as at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titre from baseline. ELISpot IFNγ and positive T-cell responses measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays were compared across the groups as endpoints for cell-mediated responses. Stratified analyses of the immune responses were done based on the pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres among the participants as low or negative (≤1:200) or high (>1:200). The sample size was not determined on the basis of statistical power calculations; however, a minimum sample size of 20–30 participants for a pilot vaccine trial has been recommended by the National Medical Products Administration, China. We assessed the number and proportion of participants with adverse reactions post-vaccination and compared safety profiles across the dose groups. The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were presented as geometric mean titres with 95% CIs and the cellular responses were shown as a proportion of positive responders. We used the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test to analyse categorical data, ANOVA to analyse the log transformed antibody titres, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for data that were not normally distributed. When the overall difference across the three groups was significant, pairwise comparisons were made and the differences between groups were estimated with 95% CIs. Multivariable analysis was used to establish the possible effects on the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine candidates. Hypothesis testing was two-sided with an α value of 0·05. Statistical analyses were done by a statistician using SAS (version 9.4) or GraphPad Prism 8·0·1. SPICE (version 6.0) was used for the analysis of data from multicolour flow cytometry experiments. An independent data and safety monitoring committee, with one independent statistician, one clinician, and one epidemiologist, was established before the start of the trial. Safety data for the first 3 days post-vaccination were assessed and reviewed by the committee to ensure that there was sufficient holding time between dose escalation.

Between March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 were sequentially enrolled and assigned to receive the low dose (n=36 [33%]), middle dose (n=36 [33%]), or high dose (n=36 [33%]) of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (appendix p 2). All participants completed the vaccination and the scheduled visits within 28 days. Baseline characteristics of the participants were similar across the treatment groups (table 1).Table 1Baseline characteristicsLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)Age, years18–299 (25%)12 (33%)10 (28%)30–3913 (36%)14 (39%)15 (42%)40–498 (22%)3 (8%)7 (19%)50–606 (17%)7 (19%)4 (11%)Mean age, years37·2 (10·7)36·3 (11·5)35·5 (10·1)SexMale18 (50%)19 (53%)18 (50%)Female18 (50%)17 (47%)18 (50%)Mean body-mass index, kg/m223·3 (2·7)23·9 (2·7)24·1 (3·1)Underlying diseases** Seven participants had hypertension, chronic bronchitis, gout, or were a carrier of hepatitis B virus.Yes1 (3%)2 (6%)4 (11%)No35 (97%)34 (94%)32 (89%)Pre-existing adenovirus type-5 neutralising antibodyMean GMT168·9 (13·9)149·5 (10·5)115·0 (13·4)≤200, titre16 (44%)17 (47%)20 (56%)>200, titre20 (56%)19 (53%)16 (44%)Data are n (%) or mean (SD).

No significant difference in the overall number of adverse reactions across the treatment groups was observed. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients. Pain was reported in 17 (47%) participants in the low dose group, 20 (56%) participants in the middle dose group, and 21 (58%) participants in the high dose group. The most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions overall were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]). Fever was reported in 15 (42%) participants in the low dose group, 15 (42%) participants in the middle dose group, and 20 (56%) participants in the high dose group. Headache was reported in 14 (39%) participants in the low dose group, 11 (31%) participants in the middle dose group, and 17 (47%) participants in the high dose group. Muscle pain was reported in seven (19%) participants in the low dose group, three (8%) participants in the middle dose group, and eight (22%) participants in the high dose group. Most adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Nine participants (two [6%] in the low dose group, two [6%] in the middle dose group, and five [14%] in the high dose group) had an episode of severe fever (grade 3) with axillary temperature greater than 38·5°C. Of them, one (3%) from the high dose group reported severe fever along with severe symptoms of fatigue, dyspnoea, and muscle pain. One participant in the high dose group reported severe fatigue and joint pain (appendix p 3). These reactions occurred within 24 h post-vaccination, and persisted for no more than 48 h. We found no significant difference in the incidences of adverse reactions or overall adverse events among the dose groups. High pre-existing Ad5 immunity (titre of >1:200 vs ≤1:200) was associated with significantly fewer occurrences of fever post-vaccination (odds ratio 0·3, 95% CI 0·1–0·6; appendix p 4). No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days. At day 7 after vaccination, nine (8%) participants had mild to moderate total bilirubin increase, ten (9%) had alanine aminotransferase increase, and four (4%) had fasting hyperglycaemia (appendix p 5), but no instances were considered as clinically significant.Table 2Adverse reactions within 7 days and overall adverse events within 28 days after vaccinationLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)Total (N=108)All adverse reactions within 0–7 daysAny30 (83%)30 (83%)27 (75%)87 (81%)Grade 32 (6%)2 (6%)6 (17%)10 (9%)Injection site adverse reactions within 0–7 daysPain17 (47%)20 (56%)21 (58%)58 (54%)Induration2 (6%)1 (3%)1 (3%)4 (4%)Redness2 (6%)1 (3%)1 (3%)4 (4%)Swelling4 (11%)4 (11%)08 (7%)Itch2 (6%)3 (8%)05 (5%)Muscular weakness001 (3%)1 (1%)Systemic adverse reactions within 0–7 daysFever15 (42%)15 (42%)20 (56%)50 (46%)Grade 3 fever2 (6%)2 (6%)5 (14%)9 (8%)Headache14 (39%)11 (31%)17 (47%)42 (39%)Fatigue17 (47%)14 (39%)16 (44%)47 (44%)Grade 3 fatigue002 (6%)2 (2%)Vomiting1 (3%)01 (3%)2 (2%)Diarrhoea3 (8%)4 (11%)5 (14%)12 (11%)Muscle pain7 (19%)3 (8%)8 (22%)18 (17%)Grade 3 muscle pain001 (3%)1 (1%)Joint pain2 (6%)2 (6%)5 (14%)9 (8%)Grade 3 joint pain001 (3%)1 (1%)Throat pain1 (3%)3 (8%)4 (11%)8 (7%)Cough1 (3%)2 (6%)3 (8%)6 (6%)Nausea2 (6%)1 (3%)3 (8%)6 (6%)Functional GI disorder1 (3%)001 (1%)Dyspnoea002 (6%)2 (2%)Grade 3 dyspnoea001 (3%)1 (1%)Appetite impaired6 (17%)5 (14%)6 (17%)17 (16%)Dizziness1 (3%)01 (3%)2 (2%)Mucosal abnormality001 (3%)1 (1%)Pruritus1 (3%)1 (3%)1 (3%)3 (3%)Overall adverse events within 0–28 daysAny31 (86%)30 (83%)27 (75%)88 (81%)Grade 32 (6%)2 (6%)6 (17%)10 (9%)Data are n (%).

Grade 3=severe (ie, prevented activity). GI=gastrointestinal. Rapid binding antibody responses to RBD were observed in all three dose groups from day 14 (table 3). At day 28, the recipients in the high dose group tended to have a higher binding antibody geometric mean titre of 1445·8 (95% CI 935·5–2234·5), followed by 806·0 (528·2–1229·9) in the middle dose group, and 615·8 (405·4–935·5) in the low dose group (high dose vs low dose 1611·5, 531·5–2691·5). At least a four-fold increase of anti-RBD antibodies was noted in 35 (97%) of 36 participants in the low dose group, 34 (94%) of 36 in the middle dose group, and 36 (100%) of 36 in the high dose group. Neutralising antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 were all negative at day 0, and increased moderately at day 14, peaking at 28 days post-vaccination. Neutralising antibody titre with a geometric mean titre of 34·0 (95% CI 22·6–50·1) was noted in the high dose group, which was significantly higher compared with 16·2 (10·4–25·2) in the middle dose group and 14·5 (9·6–21·8) in the low dose group, with an estimated difference of 27·7 (1·0–54·4) between the high dose group and the middle dose group and 33·2 (6·5–59·9) between the high dose group and the low dose group at day 28. Meanwhile, 18 (50%) participants in the low dose group, 18 (50%) in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) in the high dose group had at least a four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titres by day 28. Similar patterns of the binding antibody to spike glycoprotein and neutralising antibody titre to pseudovirus post-vaccination across the dose groups were also noted (appendix p 6). The association between the ELISA antibodies to RBD and neutralising antibody titres against live virus showed a moderate positive correlation of 0·749, and that between the ELISA antibodies to spike glycoprotein and neutralising antibody titres against live virus was 0·753, at the peak antibody response (p<0·0001). The neutralising antibody titres measured using a pseudovirus were also correlated well with those measured by live SARS-CoV-2 (appendix p 7).Table 3Specific antibody responses to the receptor binding domain, and neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2Day 14Day 28Low dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)p valueLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)p valueELISA antibodies to the receptor binding domainGMT76·5 (44·3–132·0)91·2 (55·9–148·7)132·6 (80·7–218·0)0·29615·8 (405·4–935·5)806·0 (528·2–1229·9)1445·8 (935·5–2234·5)0·016≥4-fold increase16 (44%)18 (50%)22 (61%)0·3535 (97%)34 (94%)36 (100%)0·77Neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2GMT8·2 (5·8–11·5)9·6 (6·6–14·1)12·7 (8·5–19·0)0·2414·5 (9·6–21·8)16·2 (10·4–25·2)34·0 (22·6–50·1)0·0082≥4-fold increase10 (28%)11 (31%)15 (42%)0·4218 (50%)18 (50%)27 (75%)0·046Data are mean (95% CI) or n (%).

Before vaccination, 20 (56%) participants in the low dose group, 19 (53%) participants in the middle dose group, and 16 (44%) participants in the high dose group had a high pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titre (>1:200). Only five (25%) participants of 20 in the low dose group, seven (37%) participants of 19 in the middle dose group, and ten (63%) participants of 16 in the high dose group, who had high pre-existing Ad5 immunity, had at least a four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titre at day 28 post-vaccination (appendix pp 8–10). Multivariable analysis showed that high pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres compromised the seroconversion of neutralising antibody post-vaccination, regardless of the vaccine doses, and recipients aged 45–60 years seemed to have lower seroconversion of neutralising antibody compared with the younger recipients (appendix p 11). The Ad5 neutralising antibodies were significantly boosted post-vaccination (appendix p 12). ELISpot responses at baseline were undetectable with spot-forming cells below the level of detection of the assay in all participants, but peaked at day 14 post-vaccination. The proportions of positive responders ranged from 83–97% across the dose groups, with a mean number of spot-forming cells per 100 000 cells of 20·8 (95% CI 12·7–34·0) in the low dose group, 40·8 (27·6–60·3) in the middle dose group, and 58·0 (39·1–85·9) in the high dose group (figure 1). T-cell responses in the high dose group were significantly higher than that in the low dose group (p<0·0010), but not significant compared with that in the middle dose group. A slight decrease of the T-cell responses across the dose groups was noted at day 28. High levels of baseline Ad5 neutralising antibody titre reduced the peak of post-vaccination T-cell responses in all the dose groups, particularly for the low dose group. Despite the effect of high pre-existing Ad5 immunity, positive responders were identified in 15 (75%) of 20 participants in the low dose group, 18 (95%) of 19 participants in the middle dose group, and 15 (94%) of 16 participants in the high dose group at day 14, and 12 (60%) of 20 participants in the low dose group, 16 (84%) of 19 participants in the middle dose group, and 16 (100%) of 16 participants in the high dose group at day 28.Figure 1Specific T-cell response measured by ELISpotShow full caption(A) The number of specific T cells with secretion of IFNγ at days 0, 14, and 28 in all participants, and stratified by pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres.

IFNγ was detected from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after the vaccination at day 14 and 28, in all dose groups (figure 2, appendix p 13). The TNFα expression from CD4+ T cells tended to be significantly lower in the low dose group than that in the high dose (p<0·0001) and middle dose groups (p=0·0032), on day 14. The TNFα expression from CD8+ T cells showed an overall p value of less than 0·0001 across the three groups on day 14. And the TNFα expression from CD8+ T cells tended to be higher in the high dose group than that in both the middle dose group (p=0·016) and the low dose group (p<0·0001). The p values are for the pairwise comparisons between groups. Amounts of IL-2 detected from CD4+ T cells were higher than that detected from CD8+ cells. The proportions of polyfunctional phenotypes detected from memory CD4+ T cells were higher than those from CD8+ T cells. Higher proportions of polyfunctional phenotypes were noted with the higher vaccine doses. We also noted that pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody had a negative effect on the pattern of T-cell responses (appendix pp 14–16). A post-hoc analysis showed that 28 (78%) participants in the low dose group, 33 (92%) participants in the middle dose group, and 36 (100%) participants in the high dose group showed either positive T-cell responses to spike glycoprotein or seroconversion of neutralising antibody to live SARS-CoV-2, at day 28 post-vaccination (appendix p 17).Figure 2Flow cytometry with intracellular cytokine staining before and after vaccinationShow full caption(A) Percentage of cells secreting IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 from CD4+ T cells.

To exclude any possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the study period, we tested the serum antibodies to nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in participants at day 28 using a special IgG/IgM rapid test kit (Vazyme Biotech, number CD101, Nanjing, China), but none of the participants were positive. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a first-in-human clinical trial of a novel Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerated in healthy adults in all three dose groups. The most common adverse reactions were fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain with no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions across the groups. Most adverse events reported were mild or moderate in severity. We noticed a higher reactogenicity profile of the high dose at 1·5 × 1011 viral particles, presenting as severe fever, fatigue, muscle pain, or joint pain, which might be associated with viraemia caused by Ad5 vector infection. However, the severe adverse reactions were transient and self-limiting. Additionally, no abnormal changes in laboratory measurements were clinically significant or considered to be related to the vaccine. The profile of adverse events reported in this trial is similar to that of another Ad5 vector-based Ebola vaccine expressing glycoprotein.16Zhu FC Hou LH Li JX et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a novel recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine in healthy adults in China: preliminary report of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial.Lancet. 2015; 385: 2272-2279Google Scholar To accelerate the process of clinical evaluation of the candidate COVID-19 vaccine, we selected doses for the phase 2 study mainly on the basis of the safety profile of the candidate vaccines shown in the participants within 7 days and 14 days post-vaccination. We chose the low dose (5 × 1010 viral particles) and middle dose (1 × 1011 viral particles) to be further assessed in a phase 2 clinical trial. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was immunogenic, inducing humoral and T-cell responses rapidly in most participants. Onset of detectable immune responses was rapid, with T-cell responses peaking at day 14 after vaccination and antibodies peaking at day 28. The antibody response to the vaccine in the high dose group was slightly greater than that in the middle dose and low dose groups. A single dose of Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was able to elicit a four-fold increase in binding antibodies to RBD in 94–100% of participants, and a four-fold increase to live virus in 50–75% of participants. Despite differences in magnitudes of the antibodies measured through different methods, there was a strong positive correlation between binding antibodies and neutralising antibody titres to the live virus. High proportions of participants with positive T-cell responses were noted across the all dose groups post-vaccination. The activation of both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was observed in vaccine recipients, particularly for antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. However, both the specific antibody response and T-cell response induced by vaccination were partly diminished by the presence of high pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity. Currently, correlates of protection for a vaccine against COVID-19 are unknown, and the roles of the specific antibodies or T cells in building effective protection are not yet defined. Therefore, we are unable to predict the protection of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine on the basis of the vaccine-elicited immune responses in this study. However, previous studies investigating SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) found that the increases in specific antibodies were temporary, and declined quickly in patients after recovery, whereas the specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses played an essential role in immunity.17Zhao J Zhao J Perlman S T cell responses are required for protection from clinical disease and for virus clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected mice.J Virol. 2010; 84: 9318-9325Google Scholar,  18Channappanavar R Fett C Zhao J Meyerholz DK Perlman S Virus-specific memory CD8 T cells provide substantial protection from lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.J Virol. 2014; 88: 11034-11044Google Scholar A similar rapid decline of the specific antibody amounts in patients with COVID-19 after recovery was also noted,19Wang X Guo X Xin Q et al.Neutralizing antibodies responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients.medRxiv. 2020;  (DOI: 2020.04.15.20065623 (preprint))Google Scholar,  20Wu F Wang A Liu M et al.Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications.medRxiv. 2020;  (DOI: 2020.03.30.20047365 (preprint))Google Scholar suggesting that both specific cellular and humoral immunity are potentially important for a successful COVID-19 vaccine. Here, we only report the data within 28 days after the vaccination, but we are going to follow up the vaccine recipients for at least 6 months, so more data will be obtained. This study was done in Wuhan, Hubei province, which was the centre of the COVID-19 epidemic in China.21Chen N Zhou M Dong X et al.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 507-513Google Scholar People living in the city of Wuhan had a much higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those living in other cities outside of Hubei province, even though when we initiated this trial, the city had already begun lockdown and implemented mandatory home isolation for residents. Therefore, we did serological screening, nucleic acid testing, and chest CT to exclude participants who had been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during recruitment. In addition, we arranged for all participants in our study to stay in a designated hotel for 14 days post-vaccination. This arrangement facilitated the observation of adverse events after the immunisation of the participants, and reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the following 2 weeks. These measures allowed the study to be done successfully without interference by the circulation of SARS-CoV-2, which is especially important in the absence of a placebo control. Interpretation of the results of this study is limited by the small size of the cohort, the short duration of follow-up, and the absence of a randomised control group. As it was a first-in-human study of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine, it was not designed to measure the vaccine efficacy. However, in preclinical studies, seven out of eight ferrets were protected from having detectable virus copies when challenged by SARS-CoV-2 through nasal dripping 21 days after immunisation with the vaccine, whereas only one out of eight ferrets in the control group was negative for virus copies (Wei C, unpublished). We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the candidate vaccine in healthy adults, with no interference by underlying diseases or medicines. However, results of our study indicated that older age could have a negative effect on the vaccine-elicited responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this trial, no participants were older than 60 years and only 16% of the participants were older than 50 years, providing limited information on the capability of generating a potent cellular and humoral response in the older population. Since age has also been identified as an independent risk factor for severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,4Weiss P Murdoch DR Clinical course and mortality risk of severe COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1014-1015Google Scholar,  22Ye G Pan Z Pan Y et al.Clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reactivation.J Infect. 2020; 80: e14-e17Google Scholar and there is a possibility that an even lower immune response might be found in the older population, we are going to include participants who are older than 60 years in the phase 2 study considering this population as an important target population for a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, experience with vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS have raised concerns about the antibody-dependent enhancement in participants who are infected with a circulating SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination.23Lurie N Saville M Hatchett R Halton J Developing Covid-19 vaccines at pandemic speed.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (NEJMp2005630.)Google Scholar However, this study was not statistically powered to measure any safety outcome, especially for the concerns around immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement events associated with the full-length spike glycoprotein vaccine antigen.24Cao X COVID-19: immunopathology and its implications for therapy.Nat Rev Immunol. 2020; 20: 269-270Google Scholar Our study found that the pre-existing Ad5 immunity could slow down the rapid immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and also lower the peak of the responses, particularly for humoral immunity. The high pre-existing Ad5 immunity might also have a negative effect on the persistence of the vaccine-elicited immune responses. In previous studies, heterologous prime-boost combinations or homologous prime-boost regimens with Ad5 vectored vaccines were shown to be able to induce more strong and durable immunogenic responses in populations with high pre-existing Ad5 immunity.25Venkatraman N Ndiaye BP Bowyer G et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous prime-boost Ebola virus vaccine regimen in healthy adults in the United Kingdom and Senegal.J Infect Dis. 2019; 219: 1187-1197Google Scholar,  26Dolzhikova IV Zubkova OV Tukhvatulin AI et al.Safety and immunogenicity of GamEvac-Combi, a heterologous VSV- and Ad5-vectored Ebola vaccine: an open phase I/II trial in healthy adults in Russia.Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017; 13: 613-620Google Scholar,  27Shukarev G Callendret B Luhn K Douoguih M A two-dose heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimen eliciting sustained immune responses to Ebola Zaire could support a preventive strategy for future outbreaks.Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017; 13: 266-270Google Scholar Nevertheless, limited information is available for the effects of multiple doses of the candidate Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in humans, which warrants further investigation. Over the past decade, the vaccine industry and clinical research centres have been asked to provide urgent responses to epidemics of emerging infectious diseases, such as H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus, Zika, MERS, and now SARS-CoV-2.23Lurie N Saville M Hatchett R Halton J Developing Covid-19 vaccines at pandemic speed.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (NEJMp2005630.)Google Scholar The risk of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, making the need for effective vaccines even more urgent.28Richardson S Hirsch JS Narasimhan M et al.Presenting characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area.JAMA. 2020;  (published online April 22.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.6775Google Scholar We started the development of this candidate vaccine in January, 2020, when SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated and sequenced.

We plan to monitor the participants in our upcoming phase 2 and phase 3 studies to assess the indication for any such acquisition. In conclusion, we found that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic in healthy adults. Specific humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination, and rapid, specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 after one shot of the vaccine. There is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for the control of the COVID-19 outbreak. An ongoing phase 2 trial in China (NCT04341389) will provide more information on the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine. Contributors F-CZ and Y-HL were co-first authors.

The absence of an effective treatment against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led clinicians to redirect drugs that are known to be effective for other medical conditions to the treatment of COVID-19. Key among these repurposed therapeutic agents are the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine, which is used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.1Principi N Esposito S Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of COVID-19.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online April 17.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30296-6Google Scholar,  2Perricone C Triggianese P Bartoloni E et al.The anti-viral facet of anti-rheumatic drugs: lessons from COVID-19.J Autoimmun. 2020;  (published online April 17.)DOI:10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102468Google Scholar These drugs have been shown in laboratory conditions to have antiviral properties as well as immunomodulatory effects.3Liu J Cao R Xu M et al.Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 16Google Scholar,  4Devaux CA Rolain JM Colson P Raoult D New insights on the antiviral effects of chloroquine against coronavirus: what to expect for COVID-19?.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 12.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938Google Scholar However, the use of this class of drugs for COVID-19 is based on a small number of anecdotal experiences that have shown variable responses in uncontrolled observational analyses, and small, open-label, randomised trials that have largely been inconclusive.5Tang W Cao Z Han M et al.Hydroxychloroquine in patients mainly with mild to moderate COVID-19: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online May 7.)

Concerns have been raised that these drugs or their combination with macrolides could result in electrical instability and predispose patients to ventricular arrhythmias. Whether these drugs improve outcomes or are associated with harm in COVID-19 remains unknown.Added value of this studyIn the absence of reported randomised trials, there is an urgent need to evaluate real-world evidence related to outcomes with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (used with or without macrolides) in COVID-19. Using an international, observational registry across six continents, we assessed 96 032 patients with COVID-19, of whom 14 888 were treated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or their combination with a macrolide. After controlling for age, sex, race or ethnicity, underlying comorbidities, and disease severity at baseline, the use of all four regimens was associated with an increased hazard for de-novo ventricular arrythmia and death in hospital. This study provides real-world evidence on the use of these therapeutic regimens by including a large number of patients from across the world. Thus, to our knowledge, these findings provide the most comprehensive evidence of the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) for treatment of COVID-19.Implications of all the available evidenceWe found no evidence of benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used either alone or with a macrolide. Previous evidence was derived from either small anecdotal studies or inconclusive small randomised trials. Our study included a large number of patients across multiple geographic regions and provides the most robust real-world evidence to date on the usefulness of these treatment regimens. Although observational studies cannot fully account for unmeasured confounding factors, our findings suggest not only an absence of therapeutic benefit but also potential harm with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine drug regimens (with or without a macrolide) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

Although several multicentre randomised controlled trials are underway, there is a pressing need to provide accurate clinical guidance because the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine along with macrolides is widespread, often with little regard for potential risk. Some countries have stockpiled these drugs, resulting in a shortage of these medications for those that need them for approved clinical indications.10Peschken CA Possible consequences of a shortage of hydroxychloroquine for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus amid the COVID-19 pandemic.J Rheumatol. 2020;  (published online April 8.)DOI:10.3899/jrheum.200395Google Scholar The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19 using a large multinational registry to assess their real-world application. Principally, we sought to analyse the association between these treatment regimens and in-hospital death. Secondarily, we aimed to evaluate the occurrence of de-novo clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias. We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised 671 hospitals located in six continents (appendix p 3). The Surgical Outcomes Collaborative (Surgisphere Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA) consists of de-identified data obtained by automated data extraction from inpatient and outpatient electronic health records, supply chain databases, and financial records. The registry uses a cloud-based health-care data analytics platform that includes specific modules for data acquisition, data warehousing, data analytics, and data reporting. A manual data entry process is used for quality assurance and validation to ensure that key missing values are kept to a minimum. The Surgical Outcomes Collaborative (hereafter referred to as the Collaborative) ensures compliance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on real-world evidence. Real-world data are collected through automated data transfers that capture 100% of the data from each health-care entity at regular, predetermined intervals, thus reducing the impact of selection bias and missing values, and ensuring that the data are current, reliable, and relevant. Verifiable source documentation for the elements include electronic inpatient and outpatient medical records and, in accordance with the FDA guidance on relevance of real-world data, data acquisition is performed through use of a standardised Health Level Seven-compliant data dictionary, with data collected on a prospective ongoing basis. The validation procedure for the registry refers to the standard operating procedures in place for each of the four ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 27001:2013 certified features of the registry: data acquisition, data warehousing, data analytics, and data reporting. The standardised Health Level Seven-compliant data dictionary used by the Collaborative serves as the focal point for all data acquisition and warehousing. Once this data dictionary is harmonised with electronic health record data, data acquisition is completed using automated interfaces to expedite data transfer and improve data integrity. Collection of a 100% sample from each health-care entity is validated against financial records and external databases to minimise selection bias. To reduce the risk of inadvertent protected health information disclosures, all such information is stripped before storage in the cloud-based data warehouse. The Collaborative is intended to minimise the effects of information bias and selection bias by capturing all-comer data and consecutive patient enrolment by capturing 100% of the data within electronic systems, ensuring that the results remain generalisable to the larger population. The Collaborative is compliant with the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines for registries. With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, this registry was used to collect data from hospitals in the USA (that are selected to match the epidemiological characteristics of the US population) and internationally, to achieve representation from diverse populations across six continents. Data have been collected from a variety of urban and rural hospitals, academic or community hospitals, and for-profit and non-profit hospitals. The data collection and analyses are deemed exempt from ethics review. We included all patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, at hospitals participating in the registry and with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection, for whom a clinical outcome of either hospital discharge or death during hospitalisation was recorded. A positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assay of nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens, and this finding was used for classifying a patient as positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 was diagnosed, at each site, on the basis of WHO guidance.11WHOClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when novel COVID-19 disease is suspected: interim guidance.https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdfDate: March 13, 2020Date accessed: April 24, 2020Google Scholar Patients who did not have a record of testing in the database, or who had a negative test, were not included in the study. Only one positive test was necessary for the patient to be included in the analysis. Patients who received either hydroxychloroquine or a chloroquine analogue-based treatment (with or without a second-generation macrolide) were included in the treatment group. Patients who received treatment with these regimens starting more than 48 h after COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. We also excluded data from patients for whom treatment was initiated while they were on mechanical ventilation or if they were receiving therapy with the antiviral remdesivir. These specific exclusion criteria were established to avoid enrolment of patients in whom the treatment might have started at non-uniform times during the course of their COVID-19 illness and to exclude individuals for whom the drug regimen might have been used during a critical phase of illness, which could skew the interpretation of the results. Thus, we defined four distinct treatment groups, in which all patients started therapy within 48 h of an established COVID-19 diagnosis: chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide. All other included patients served as the control population. Patient demographics, including age, body-mass index (BMI), sex, race or ethnicity, and continent of origin were obtained. Underlying comorbidities (based on International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification codes) present in either the inpatient or outpatient electronic health record were collected, which included cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and history of a cardiac arrhythmia), current or previous history of smoking, history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and presence of an immunosuppressed condition (steroid use, pre-existing immunological condition, or current chemotherapy in individuals with cancer). We collected data on use of medications at baseline, including cardiac medications (angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins) or use of antiviral therapy other than the drug regimens being evaluated. The initiation of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine during hospital admission was recorded, including the time of initiation. The use of second-generation macrolides, specifically azithromycin and clarithromycin, was similarly recorded. A quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) was calculated for the start of therapy (including a scored calculation of the mental status, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) on room air was recorded, as measures of disease severity. The primary outcome of interest was the association between use of a treatment regimen containing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (with or without a second-generation macrolide) when initiated early after COVID-19 diagnosis with the endpoint of in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome of interest was the association between these treatment regimens and the occurrence of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (defined as the first occurrence of a non-sustained [at least 6 sec] or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) during hospitalisation. We also analysed the rates of progression to mechanical ventilation use and the total and intensive care unit lengths of stay (in days) for patients in each group. For the primary analysis of in-hospital mortality, we controlled for confounding factors, including demographic variables, comorbidities, disease severity at presentation, and other medication use (cardiac medications and other antiviral therapies). Categorical variables are shown as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as means with SDs. Comparison of continuous data between groups was done using the unpaired t-test and categorical data were compared using Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0·05 was considered significant. Multiple imputation for missing values was not possible because for disease and drug variables, there were no codes to indicate that data were missing; if the patient's electronic health record did not include information on a clinical characteristic, it was assumed that the characteristic was not present. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to evaluate the effect of age, sex, race or ethnicity (using white race as a reference group), comorbidities (BMI, presence of coronary artery disease, presence of congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, or COPD, current smoker, history of hypertension, immunocompromised state, and history of hyperlipidaemia), medications (cardiac medications, antivirals, and the treatment regimens of interest), and severity of illness scores (qSOFA <1 and SPO2 <94%) on the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia (using the time from admission to first occurrence, or if the event did not occur, to the time of discharge) and mortality (using the time from admission to inpatient mortality or discharge). Age and BMI were treated as continuous variables and all other data were treated as categorical variables in the model. From the model, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated for included variables to determine their effect on the risk of in-hospital mortality (primary endpoint) or subsequent mechanical ventilation or death (composite endpoint). Independence of survival times (or time to first arrhythmia for the ventricular arrhythmia analysis) was confirmed. Proportionality between the predictors and the hazard was validated through an evaluation of Schoenfeld residuals, which found p>0·05 and thus confirmed proportionality. To minimise the effect of confounding factors, a propensity score matching analysis was done individually for each of the four treatment groups compared with a control group that received no form of that therapy. For each treatment group, a separate matched control was identified using exact and propensity-score matched criteria with a calliper of 0·001. This method was used to provide a close approximation of demographics, comorbidities, disease severity, and baseline medications between patients. The propensity score was based on the following variables: age, BMI, gender, race or ethnicity, comorbidities, use of ACE inhibitors, use of statins, use of angiotensin receptor blockers, treatment with other antivirals, qSOFA score of less than 1, and SPO2 of less than 94% on room air. The patients were well matched, with standardised mean difference estimates of less than 10% for all matched parameters. Additional analyses were done to examine the robustness of the estimates initially obtained. Individual analyses by continent of origin and sex-adjusted analyses using Cox proportional hazards models were performed. A tipping-point analysis (an analysis that shows the effect size and prevalence of an unmeasured confounder that could shift the upper boundary of the CI towards null) was also done. All statistical analyses were done with R version 3.6.3 and SPSS version 26. The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author and co-author ANP had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 96 032 hospitalised patients from 671 hospitals were diagnosed with COVID-19 between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020 and met the inclusion criteria for this study (figure 1). All included patients completed their hospital course (discharged or died) by April 21, 2020. Patients who were hospitalised during the study period without a completed course were unable to be analysed. The study cohort included 63 315 (65·9%) patients from North America, 16 574 (17·3%) from Europe, 7555 (7·9%) from Asia, 4402 (4·6%) from Africa, 3577 (3·7%) from South America, and 609 (0·6%) from Australia (details of the number of hospitals per continent are presented in the appendix, p 3). The mean age was 53·8 years (SD 17·6), 44 426 (46·3%) were women, mean BMI was 27·6 kg/m2 (SD 5·5; 29 510 [30·7%] were obese with BMI ≥30 kg/m2), 64 220 (66·9%) were white, 9054 (9·4%) were black, 5978 (6·2%) were Hispanic, and 13 519 (14·1%) were of Asian origin (appendix p 4). In terms of comorbidities, 30 198 (31·4%) had hyperlipidaemia, 25 810 (26·9%) had hypertension, 13 260 (13·8%) had diabetes, 3177 (3·3%) had COPD, 2868 (3·0%) had an underlying immunosuppressed condition, 16 553 (17·2%) were former smokers, and 9488 (9·9%) were current smokers. In terms of pre-existing cardiovascular disease, 12 137 (12·6%) had coronary artery disease, 2368 (2·5%) had a history of congestive heart failure, and 3381 (3·5%) had a history of arrhythmia. The mean length of stay in hospital was 9·1 days (SD 6·4), with an overall in-hospital mortality of 10 698 (11·1%) of 96 032. The use of other antivirals was recorded in 38 927 (40·5%) patients as treatment for COVID-19. The most common antivirals were lopinavir with ritonavir (12 304 [31·6%]), ribavirin (7904 [20·3%]), and oseltamivir (5101 [13·1%]). Combination therapy with more than one of these antiviral regimens was used for 6782 (17·4%) patients.Figure 1Study profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) The treatment groups included 1868 patients who were given chloroquine alone, 3016 given hydroxychloroquine alone, 3783 given chloroquine with a macrolide and 6221 given hydroxychloroquine and a macrolide. The median time from hospitalisation to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2 days (IQR 1–4). The mean daily dose and duration of the various drug regimens were as follows: chloroquine alone, 765 mg (SD 308) and 6·6 days (2·4); hydroxychloroquine alone, 596 mg (126) and 4·2 days (1·9); chloroquine with a macrolide, 790 mg (320) and 6·8 days (2·5); and hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, 597 mg (128) and 4·3 days (2·0). Additional details of the study cohort are provided in the appendix (pp 4–5). Demographic variables and comorbidities were compared among survivors and non-survivors (table 1). Non-survivors were older, more likely to be obese, more likely to be men, more likely to be black or Hispanic, and to have diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and a history of arrhythmias. Non-survivors were also more likely to have COPD and to have reported current smoking.Table 1Demographics and comorbidities of patients by survival or non-survival during hospitalisationSurvivors (n=85 334)Non-survivors (n=10 698)p valueAge, years53·1 (17·5)60·0 (17·6)<0·0001BMI, kg/m227·0 (5·1)31·8 (6·4)<0·0001Obese, BMI >30 kg/m222 992 (26·9%)6518 (60·9%)<0·0001SexFemale40 169 (47·1%)4257 (39·8%)<0·0001Male45 165 (52·9%)6441 (60·2%)<0·0001Race or ethnicityWhite57 503 (67·4%)6717 (62·8%)<0·0001Black7219 (8·5%)1835 (17·2%)<0·0001Hispanic4948 (5·8%)1030 (9·6%)<0·0001Asian12 657 (14·8%)862 (8·1%)<0·0001Native American1023 (1·2%)56 (0·5%)<0·0001Other1984 (2·3%)198 (1·9%)0·0019Comorbidities at baselineCoronary artery disease9777 (11·5%)2360 (22·1%)<0·0001Congestive heart failure1828 (2·1%)540 (5·0%)<0·0001Arrhythmia2700 (3·2%)681 (6·4%)<0·0001Diabetes10 963 (12·8%)2297 (21·5%)<0·0001Hypertension21 948 (25·7%)3862 (36·1%)<0·0001Hyperlipidaemia26 480 (31·0%)3718 (34·8%)<0·0001COPD2603 (3·1%)574 (5·4%)<0·0001Current smoker7972 (9·3%)1516 (14·2%)<0·0001Former smoker14 681 (17·2%)1872 (17·5%)0·45Immunocompromised2406 (2·8%)462 (4·3%)<0·0001MedicationsACE inhibitor7521 (8·8%)428 (4·0%)<0·0001Statin8506 (10·0%)739 (6·9%)<0·0001Angiotensin receptor blocker5190 (6·1%)659 (6·2%)0·75Antiviral35 189 (41·2%)3738 (34·9%)<0·0001Disease severityqSOFA <171 457 (83·7%)7911 (73·9%)<0·0001SPO2 <94%7188 (8·4%)2129 (19·9%)<0·0001Treatment groupChloroquine alone1561 (1·8%)307 (2·9%)<0·0001Chloroquine with macrolide** Macrolides include only azithromycin or clarithromycin.2944 (3·4%)839 (7·8%)<0·0001Hydroxychloroquine alone2473 (2·9%)543 (5·1%)<0·0001Hydroxychloroquine with macrolide** Macrolides include only azithromycin or clarithromycin.4742 (5·6%)1479 (13·8%)<0·0001OutcomesDe-novo ventricular arrhythmia839 (1·0%)400 (3·7%)<0·0001Non-ICU length of stay, days9·0 (6·2)9·8 (7·4)<0·0001ICU length of stay, days2·1 (3·7)9·4 (10·6)<0·0001Total length of stay, days11·1 (7·3)19·2 (14·4)<0·0001Mechanical ventilation4821 (5·6%)4533 (42·4%)<0·0001Data are mean (SD) or n (%).

Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality are shown in figure 2. Age, BMI, black race or Hispanic ethnicity (versus white race), coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, history of arrhythmia, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, COPD, being a current smoker, and immunosuppressed condition were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death. Female sex, ethnicity of Asian origin, use of ACE inhibitors (but not angiotensin receptor blockers), and use of statins was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality risk. Compared with the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine alone (18·0%; HR 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368–1·531), chloroquine alone (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218–1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273–1·469) were independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. The multivariable Cox regression analyses by continent are shown in the appendix (pp 6–11), as well as data from the sex-adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses (pp 12–13) and a separate Cox regression analysis for the combined endpoint of mechanical ventilation or mortality (p 14).Figure 2Independent predictors of in-hospital mortalityShow full captionAge and BMI are continuous variables.

Analyses using propensity score matching by treatment group are shown in the appendix (pp 15–18). The results indicated that the associations between the drug regimens and mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias were consistent with the primary analysis. A tipping point analysis was done to assess the effects of an unmeasured confounder on the findings of significance with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (appendix pp 19–20). For chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 50% in the exposed population would need to have an HR of 1·5 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. For a comparison with the observed confounders in this study, if congestive heart failure (which has an HR of 1·756) were left out of the model, it would need to have a prevalence of approximately 30% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis. Similarly, for hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 37% in the exposed population would need to have an HR of 2·0 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. Again, congestive heart failure (which has an HR of 1·756) would need to have a prevalence of approximately 50% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis, had it not been adjusted for in the Cox proportional hazards model. In this large multinational real-world analysis, we did not observe any benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (when used alone or in combination with a macrolide) on in-hospital outcomes, when initiated early after diagnosis of COVID-19. Each of the drug regimens of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide was associated with an increased hazard for clinically significant occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of in-hospital death with COVID-19.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with concerns of cardiovascular toxicity, particularly because of their known relationship with electrical instability, characterised by QT interval prolongation (the time taken for ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation). This mechanism relates to blockade of the hERG potassium channel,16Traebert M Dumotier B Meister L Hoffmann P Dominguez-Estevez M Suter W Inhibition of hERG K+ currents by antimalarial drugs in stably transfected HEK293 cells.Eur J Pharmacol. 2004; 484: 41-48Google Scholar which lengthens ventricular repolarisation and the duration of ventricular action potentials.

This study suggested that a higher dose of chloroquine represented a safety hazard, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. In another cohort study of 90 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, Mercuro and colleagues26Mercuro NJ Yen CF Shim DJ et al.Risk of QT interval prolongation associated with use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin among hospitalized patients testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).JAMA Cardiol. 2020;  (published online May 1.)DOI:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1834Google Scholar found that the concomitant use of a macrolide was associated with a greater change in the corrected QT interval. Our study did not examine the QT interval but instead directly analysed the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrythmias. We showed an independent association of the use of either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias. We also note that the hazard of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias increased when the drugs were used in combination with a macrolide. In our analysis, which was dominated by patients from North America, we noted that higher BMI emerged as a risk marker for worse in-hospital survival. Obesity is a known risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.27Lavie CJ Arena R Alpert MA Milani RV Ventura HO Management of cardiovascular diseases in patients with obesity.Nat Rev Cardiol. 2018; 15: 45-56Google Scholar,  28Sanchis-Gomar F Lavie CJ Mehra MR Henry BM Lippi G Obesity and outcomes in COVID-19: when an epidemic and pandemic collide.Mayo Clin Proc. 2020;  (published online May 19.)DOI:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.05.006Google Scholar The most commonly reported arrhythmias are atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Although age, race, and BMI were predictive of an increased risk for death with COVID-19 in our analysis, they were not found to be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias on our multivariable regression analysis. The only variables found to be independently predictive of ventricular arrhythmias were the four treatment regimens, along with underlying cardiovascular disease and COPD. Thus, the presence of cardiovascular comorbidity in the study population could partially explain the observed risk of increased cardiovascular toxicity with the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, especially when used in combination with macrolides. In this investigation, consistent with our previous findings in a smaller cohort of 8910 patients,20Mehra MR Desai SS Kuy S Henry TD Patel AN Cardiovascular disease, drug therapy, and mortality in COVID-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online May 1.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621Google Scholar we found that women and patients being treated with ACE inhibitors (but not angiotensin receptor blockers) or statins had lower mortality with COVID-19. These findings imply that drugs that stabilise cardiovascular function and improve endothelial cell dysfunction might improve prognosis, independent of the use of cardiotoxic drug combinations.21Varga Z Flammer AJ Steiger P et al.Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1417-1418Google Scholar Our study has several limitations. The association of decreased survival with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment regimens should be interpreted cautiously. Due to the observational study design, we cannot exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors, although we have reassuringly noted consistency between the primary analysis and the propensity score matched analyses. Nevertheless, a cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred. These data do not apply to the use of any treatment regimen used in the ambulatory, out-of-hospital setting. Randomised clinical trials will be required before any conclusion can be reached regarding benefit or harm of these agents in COVID-19 patients. We also note that although we evaluated the relationship of the drug treatment regimens with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, we did not measure QT intervals, nor did we stratify the arrhythmia pattern (such as torsade de pointes). We also did not establish if the association of increased risk of in-hospital death with use of the drug regimens is linked directly to their cardiovascular risk, nor did we conduct a drug dose-response analysis of the observed risks. Even if these limitations suggest a conservative interpretation of the findings, we believe that the absence of any observed benefit could still represent a reasonable explanation. In summary, this multinational, observational, real-world study of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation found that the use of a regimen containing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) was associated with no evidence of benefit, but instead was associated with an increase in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and a greater hazard for in-hospital death with COVID-19. These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed.

Here, we report the results of a placebo-controlled randomised trial of remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19. This was an investigator-initiated, individually randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of intravenous remdesivir in adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. The trial was done at ten hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei, China). Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review boards of each participating hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, or their legal representative if they were unable to provide consent. The trial was done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol is available online. Eligible patients were men and non-pregnant women with COVID-19 who were aged at least 18 years and were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, had pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging, had oxygen saturation of 94% or lower on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and were within 12 days of symptom onset. Eligible patients of child-bearing age (men and women) agreed to take effective contraceptive measures (including hormonal contraception, barrier methods, or abstinence) during the study period and for at least 7 days after the last study drug administration. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breast feeding; hepatic cirrhosis; alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase more than five times the upper limit of normal; known severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min per 1·73 m2) or receipt of continuous renal replacement therapy, haemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis; possibility of transfer to a non-study hospital within 72 h; and enrolment into an investigational treatment study for COVID-19 in the 30 days before screening. The use of other treatments, including lopinavir–ritonavir, was permitted. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either the remdesivir group or the placebo group. Randomisation was stratified according to the level of respiratory support as follows: (1) no oxygen support or oxygen support with nasal duct or mask; or (2) high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The permuted block (30 patients per block) randomisation sequence, including stratification, was prepared by a statistician not involved in the trial using SAS software, version 9.4. Eligible patients were allocated to receive medication in individually numbered packs, according to the sequential order of the randomisation centre (Jin Yin-tan Hospital central pharmacy). Envelopes were prepared for emergency unmasking. Patients received either intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for a total of 10 days (both provided by Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA). Patients were assessed once daily by trained nurses using diary cards that captured data on a six-category ordinal scale and safety from day 0 to 28 or death. Other clinical data were recorded using the WHO–International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) case record form. The safety assessment included daily monitoring for adverse events, clinical laboratory testing (days 1, 3, 7, and 10), 12-lead electrocardiogram (days 1 and 14), and daily vital signs measurements. Clinical data were recorded on paper case record forms and then double entered into an electronic database and validated by trial staff. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, expectorated sputa as available, and faecal or anal swab specimens were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 for viral RNA detection and quantification. The trial was monitored by a contract research organisation (Hangzhou Tigermed Consulting). Virological testing was done at the Teddy Clinical Research Laboratory (Tigermed–DI'AN, Hangzhou, China) using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), detected and quantified by Cobas z480 qPCR (Roche), using LightMix Modular SARS-CoV-2 assays (TIB MOBIOL, Berlin, Germany). At baseline, the upper (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory tract specimens were tested for detection of E-gene, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, and N-gene, then samples on the subsequent visits were quantitatively and qualitative assessed for E-gene. The primary clinical endpoint was time to clinical improvement within 28 days after randomisation. Clinical improvement was defined as a two-point reduction in patients' admission status on a six-point ordinal scale, or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. The six-point scale was as follows: death=6; hospital admission for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation=5; hospital admission for non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy=4; hospital admission for oxygen therapy (but not requiring high-flow or non-invasive ventilation)=3; hospital admission but not requiring oxygen therapy=2; and discharged or having reached discharge criteria (defined as clinical recovery—ie, normalisation of pyrexia, respiratory rate <24 breaths per minute, saturation of peripheral oxygen >94% on room air, and relief of cough, all maintained for at least 72 h)=1. The six-point scale was modified from the seven-point scale used in our previous COVID-19 lopinavir–ritonavir RCT11Cao B Wang Y Wen D et al.A trial of lopinavir–ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online March 18.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2001282Google Scholar by combining the two outpatient strata into one. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of patients in each category of the six-point scale at day 7, 14, and 28 after randomisation; all-cause mortality at day 28; frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation; duration of oxygen therapy; duration of hospital admission; and proportion of patients with nosocomial infection. Virological measures included the proportions of patients with viral RNA detected and viral RNA load (measured by quantitative RT-PCR). Safety outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and premature discontinuations of study drug. The original design required a total of 325 events across both groups, which would provide 80% power under a one-sided type I error of 2·5% if the hazard ratio (HR) comparing remdesivir to placebo is 1·4, corresponding to a change in time to clinical improvement of 6 days assuming that time to clinical improvement is 21 days on placebo. One interim analysis using triangular boundaries23Whitehead J Stratton I Group sequential clinical trials with triangular continuation regions.Biometrics. 1983; 39: 227-236Google Scholar and a 2:1 allocation ratio between remdesivir and placebo had been accounted for in the original design. Assuming an 80% event rate within 28 days across both groups and a dropout rate of 10% implies that about 453 patients should be recruited for this trial (151 on placebo and 302 on remdesivir). The possibility for an interim analysis after enrolment of about 240 patients was included in the design if requested by the independent data safety and monitoring board. The primary efficacy analysis was done on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis with all randomly assigned patients. Time to clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28; no clinical improvement at day 28 or death before day 28 were considered as right censored at day 28. Time to clinical improvement was portrayed by Kaplan-Meier plot and compared with a log-rank test. The HR and 95% CI for clinical improvement and HR with 95% CI for clinical deterioration were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model. Other analyses include subgroup analyses for those receiving treatment 10 days or less vs more than 10 days after symptom onset, time to clinical deterioration (defined as one category increase or death), and for viral RNA load at entry. The differences in continuous variables between the groups was calculated using Hodges-Lehmann estimation. We present adverse event data on the patients' actual treatment exposure, coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Statistical analyses were done using SAS software, version 9.4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 255 patients were screened, of whom 237 were eligible (figure 1). 158 patients were assigned to receive remdesivir and 79 to receive placebo; one patient in the placebo group withdrew their previously written informed consent after randomisation, so 158 and 78 patients were included in the ITT population. No patients were enrolled after March 12, because of the control of the outbreak in Wuhan and on the basis of the termination criteria specified in the protocol, the data safety and monitoring board recommended that the study be terminated and data analysed on March 29. At this stage, the interim analysis was abandoned. When all the other assumptions stayed the same, with the actual enrolment of 236 participants, the statistical power was reduced from 80% to 58%.Figure 1Trial profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) Three patients in the remdesivir group did not start their assigned treatment so were not included in safety analyses (figure 1). The median age of study patients was 65 years (IQR 56–71); sex distribution was 89 (56%) men versus 69 (44%) women in the remdesivir group and 51 (65%) versus 27 (35%) in the placebo group (table 1). The most common comorbidity was hypertension, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease. Lopinavir–ritonavir was co-administered in 42 (18%) patients at baseline. Most patients were in category 3 of the six-point ordinal scale of clinical status at baseline. Some imbalances existed at enrolment between the groups, including more patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease in the remdesivir group than the placebo group. More patients in the control group than in the remdesivir group had been symptomatic for 10 days or less at the time of starting remdesivir or placebo treatment, and a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients had a respiratory rate of more than 24 breaths per min. No other major differences in symptoms, signs, laboratory results, disease severity, or treatments were observed between groups at baseline.Table 1Baseline patient characteristicsRemdesivir group (n=158)Placebo group (n=78)Age, years66·0 (57·0–73·0)64·0 (53·0–70·0)SexMen89 (56%)51 (65%)Women69 (44%)27 (35%)Any comorbidities112 (71%)55 (71%)Hypertension72 (46%)30 (38%)Diabetes40 (25%)16 (21%)Coronary heart disease15 (9%)2 (3%)Body temperature, °C36·8 (36·5–37·2)36·8 (36·5–37·2)Fever56 (35%)31 (40%)Respiratory rate >24 breaths per min36 (23%)11 (14%)White blood cell count, × 109 per LMedian6·2 (4·4–8·3)6·4 (4·5–8·3)4–10108/155 (70%)58 (74%)<427/155 (17%)12 (15%)>1020/155 (13%)8 (10%)Lymphocyte count, × 109 per L0·8 (0·6–1·1)0·7 (0·6–1·2)≥1·049/155 (32%)23 (29%)<1·0106/155 (68%)55 (71%)Platelet count, × 109 per L183·0 (144·0–235·0)194·5 (141·0–266·0)≥100148/155 (95%)75 (96%)<1007/155 (5%)3 (4%)Serum creatinine, μmol/L68·0 (56·0–82·0)71·3 (56·0–88·7)≤133151/154 (98%)76 (97%)>1333/154 (2%)2 (3%)Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L31·0 (22·0–44·0)33·0 (24·0–48·0)≤40109/155 (70%)49 (63%)>4046/155 (30%)29 (37%)Alanine aminotransferase, U/L26·0 (18·0–42·0)26·0 (20·0–43·0)≤50130/155 (84%)66 (85%)>5025/155 (16%)12 (15%)Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L339·0 (247·0–441·5)329·0 (249·0–411·0)≤24536/148 (24%)17/75 (23%)>245112/148 (76%)58/75 (77%)Creatine kinase, U/L75·9 (47·0–131·1)75·0 (47·0–158·0)≤185118/141 (84%)54/67 (81%)>18523/141 (16%)13/67 (19%)National Early Warning Score 2 level at day 15·0 (3·0–7·0)4·0 (3·0–6·0)Six-category scale at day 12—hospital admission, not requiring supplemental oxygen03 (4%)3—hospital admission, requiring supplemental oxygen129 (82%)65 (83%)4—hospital admission, requiring high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive mechanical ventilation28 (18%)9 (12%)5—hospital admission, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive mechanical ventilation01 (1%)6—death1 (1%)0Baseline viral load of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, log10 copies per mL4·7 (0·3)4·7 (0·4)Receiving interferon alfa-2b at baseline29 (18%)15 (19%)Receiving lopinavir–ritonavir at baseline27 (17%)15 (19%)Antibiotic treatment at baseline121 (77%)63 (81%)Corticosteroids therapy at baseline60 (38%)31 (40%)Data are median (IQR), n (%), n/N (%), or mean (SE).

In patients with use of remdesivir within 10 days after symptom onset, 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the groups, although numerically higher in the placebo group; by contrast, in the group of patients with late use, remdesivir patients had numerically higher 28-day mortality, although there was no significant difference. Clinical improvement rates at days 14 and day 28 were also not significantly different between the groups, but numerically higher in the remdesivir group than the placebo group. For patients assigned to the remdesivir group, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was not significantly different, but numerically shorter than in those assigned to the control group; however, the number of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation was small. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in length of oxygen support, hospital length of stay, days from randomisation to discharge, days from randomisation to death and distribution of six-category scale at day 7, day 14, and day 28 (table 3; appendix p 9). Of 236 patients (158 in the remdesivir group and 78 in the placebo group) who were RT-PCR positive at enrolment, 37 (19%) of the 196 with data available had undetectable viral RNA on the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab taken at baseline. The mean baseline viral load of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs was 4·7 log10 copies per mL (SE 0·3) in the remdesivir group and 4·7 log10 copies per mL (0·4) in the control group (table 1). Viral load decreased over time similarly in both groups (figure 3A). No differences in viral load were observed when stratified by interval from symptom onset to start of study treatment (appendix p 10). In the subset of patients from whom expectorated sputa could be obtained (103 patients), the mean viral RNA load at enrolment was nearly 1-log higher in the remdesivir group than the placebo group at enrolment (figure 3B). When adjusted for baseline sputum viral load at enrolment, the remdesivir group showed no significant difference at day 5 from placebo, but a slightly more rapid decline in load (p=0·0672).Figure 3Viral load by quantitative PCR on the upper respiratory tract specimens (A) and lower respiratory tract specimens (B)Show full captionData are mean (SE).

The cumulative rate of undetectable viral RNA of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs by day 28 was 153 (78%) of 196 patients, and the negative proportion was similar among patients receiving remdesivir and those receiving placebo (appendix p 4). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 patients in the remdesivir group and 50 (64%) of 78 in the control group (table 4). The most common adverse events in the remdesivir group were constipation, hypoalbuminaemia, hypokalaemia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased total bilirubin; and in the placebo group, the most common were hypoalbuminaemia, constipation, anaemia, hypokalaemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased blood lipids, and increased total bilirubin. 28 (18%) serious adverse events were reported in the remdesivir group and 20 (26%) were reported in the control group. More patients in the remdesivir group than the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events or serious adverse events (18 [12%] in the remdesivir group vs four [5%] in the placebo group), among whom seven (5%) were due to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome in the remdesivir group. All deaths during the observation period were judged by the site investigators to be unrelated to the intervention).Table 4Summary of adverse events in safety population that occurred in more than one participantRemdesivir group (n=155)Placebo group (n=78)Any gradeGrade 3 or 4Any gradeGrade 3 or 4Adverse events (in ≥2% of patients in any treatment group)Any102 (66%)13 (8%)50 (64%)11 (14%)Hypoalbuminaemia20 (13%)012 (15%)1 (1%)Hypokalaemia18 (12%)2 (1%)11 (14%)1 (1%)Increased blood glucose11 (7%)06 (8%)0Anaemia18 (12%)1 (1%)12 (15%)2 (3%)Rash11 (7%)02 (3%)0Thrombocytopenia16 (10%)4 (3%)5 (6%)3 (4%)Increased total bilirubin15 (10%)1 (1%)7 (9%)0Increased blood lipids10 (6%)08 (10%)0Increased white blood cell count11 (7%)06 (8%)0Hyperlipidaemia10 (6%)08 (10%)0Increased blood urea nitrogen10 (6%)05 (6%)0Increased neutrophil10 (6%)04 (5%)0Aspartate aminotransferase increased7 (5%)09 (12%)0Constipation21 (14%)012 (15%)0Nausea8 (5%)02 (3%)0Diarrhoea5 (3%)02 (3%)0Vomiting4 (3%)02 (3%)0Reduced serum sodium4 (3%)02 (3%)0Increased serum potassium4 (3%)2 (1%)1 (1%)0Serious adverse eventsAny28 (18%)9 (6%)20 (26%)10 (13%)Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome16 (10%)4 (3%)6 (8%)4 (5%)Cardiopulmonary failure8 (5%)07 (9%)1 (1%)Pulmonary embolism1 (1%)1 (1%)1 (1%)1 (1%)Recurrence of COVID-191 (1%)000Cardiac arrest1 (1%)000Acute coronary syndrome001 (1%)1 (1%)Tachycardia001 (1%)0Septic shock1 (1%)01 (1%)1 (1%)Lung abscess001 (1%)1 (1%)Sepsis001 (1%)1 (1%)Bronchitis001 (1%)1 (1%)Thrombocytopenia1 (1%)1 (1%)00Increased D-dimer001 (1%)1 (1%)Haemorrhage of lower digestive tract1 (1%)1 (1%)00Ileus001 (1%)0Deep vein thrombosis1 (1%)1 (1%)1 (1%)1 (1%)Acute kidney injury1 (1%)000Diabetic ketoacidosis001 (1%)1 (1%)Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome1 (1%)02 (3%)0Events leading to drug discontinuationAny18 (12%)3 (2%)4 (5%)1 (1%)Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome7 (5%)1 (1%)1 (1%)0Secondary infection4 (3%)07 (9%)2 (3%)Cardiopulmonary failure3 (2%)01 (1%)0Nausea1 (1%)000Vomiting1 (1%)000Ileus001 (1%)0Increased alanine aminotransferase2 (1%)1 (1%)00Rash2 (1%)000Poor appetite1 (1%)000Increased total bilirubin1 (1%)000Acute kidney injury1 (1%)1 (1%)00Seizure001 (1%)0Aggravated schizophrenia001 (1%)1 (1%)Aggravated depression001 (1%)1 (1%)Data are n (%) and include all events reported after antiviral treatment.

COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. Our trial found that intravenous remdesivir did not significantly improve the time to clinical improvement, mortality, or time to clearance of virus in patients with serious COVID-19 compared with placebo. Compared with a previous study of compassionate use of remdesivir,21Grein J Ohmagari N Shin D et al.Compassionate use of remdesivir for patients with severe Covid-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online April 10.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007016Google Scholar our study population was less ill (eg, at the time of enrolment, 0·4% were on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation vs 64% in the previous study) and was treated somewhat earlier in their disease course (median 10 days vs 12 days). Such differences might be expected to favour remdesivir, providing greater effects in our study population, but our results did not meet this expectation. However, our study did not reach its target enrolment because the stringent public health measures used in Wuhan led to marked reductions in new patient presentations in mid-March, and restrictions on hospital bed availability resulted in most patients being enrolled later in the course of disease. Consequently, we could not adequately assess whether earlier remdesivir treatment might have provided clinical benefit. However, among patients who were treated within 10 days of symptom onset, remdesivir was not a significant factor but was associated with a numerical reduction of 5 days in median time to clinical improvement. Ongoing controlled clinical trials are expected to confirm or refute our findings. In one murine model of SARS, remdesivir treatment starting at 2 days after infection, after virus replication and lung airway epithelial damage had already peaked, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-1 lung titres but did not decrease disease severity or mortality.13Sheahan TP Sims AC Graham RL et al.Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses.Sci Transl Med. 2017; 9eaal3653Google Scholar A need for early treatment has been found in non-human primate models of SARS and MERS in which virus replication is very short-lived and lung pathology appears to develop more rapidly than in human infections.17de Wit E Feldmann F Cronin J et al.Prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir (GS-5734) treatment in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020; 117: 6771-6776Google Scholar,  19Williamson BN Feldmann F Schwarz B et al.Clinical benefit of remdesivir in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 22.)

Investigator's brochure of remdesivir, 5th edition.

Studies of higher-dose regimens for which there are safety data (eg, 150–200 mg daily doses) warrant consideration in severe COVID-19. Our study found that remdesivir was adequately tolerated and no new safety concerns were identified. The overall proportion of patients with serious adverse events tended to be lower in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients. However, a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients had dosing prematurely stopped by the investigators because of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, and vomiting), aminotransferase or bilirubin increases, and worsened cardiopulmonary status. Limitations of our study include insufficient power to detect assumed differences in clinical outcomes, initiation of treatment quite late in COVID-19, and the absence of data on infectious virus recovery or on possible emergence of reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. Of note, in non-human primates, the inhibitory effects of remdesivir on infectious SARS-CoV-2 recovery in bronchoalveolar lavages were much greater than in controls, but viral RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were not consistently decreased versus controls.19Williamson BN Feldmann F Schwarz B et al.Clinical benefit of remdesivir in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 22.)

Furthermore, we have no answer to whether longer treatment course and higher dose of remdesivir would be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19. In summary, we found that this dose regimen of intravenous remdesivir was adequately tolerated but did not provide significant clinical or antiviral effects in seriously ill patients with COVID-19. However, we could not exclude clinically meaningful differences and saw numerical reductions in some clinical parameters. Ongoing studies with larger sample sizes will continue to inform our understanding of the effect of remdesivir on COVID-19. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the antiviral potency of remdesivir (eg, higher-dose regimens, combination with other antivirals, or SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies) and to mitigate immunopathological host responses contributing to COVID-19 severity (eg, inhibitors of IL-6, IL-1, or TNFα) require rigorous study in patients with severe COVID-19.

DOI:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31140-5,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31140-5,Editorial,Reviving the US CDC," The COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen in the USA with 1·3 million cases and an estimated death toll of 80 684 as of May 12. States that were initially the hardest hit, such as New York and New Jersey, have decelerated the rate of infections and deaths after the implementation of 2 months of lockdown. However, the emergence of new outbreaks in Minnesota, where the stay-at-home order is set to lift in mid-May, and Iowa, which did not enact any restrictions on movement or commerce, has prompted pointed new questions about the inconsistent and incoherent national response to the COVID-19 crisis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flagship agency for the nation's public health, has seen its role minimised and become an ineffective and nominal adviser in the response to contain the spread of the virus. The strained relationship between the CDC and the federal government was further laid bare when, according to The Washington Post, Deborah Birx, the head of the US COVID-19 Task Force and a former director of the CDC's Global HIV/AIDS Division, cast doubt on the CDC's COVID-19 mortality and case data by reportedly saying: “There is nothing from the CDC that I can trust”. This is an unhelpful statement, but also a shocking indictment of an agency that was once regarded as the gold standard for global disease detection and control. How did an agency that was the first point of contact for many national health authorities facing a public health threat become so ill-prepared to protect the public's health? In the decades following its founding in 1946, the CDC became a national pillar of public health and globally respected. It trained cadres of applied epidemiologists to be deployed in the USA and abroad. CDC scientists have helped to discover new viruses and develop accurate tests for them. CDC support was instrumental in helping WHO to eradicate smallpox. However, funding to the CDC for a long time has been subject to conservative politics that have increasingly eroded the agency's ability to mount effective, evidence-based public health responses. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration resisted providing the sufficient budget that the CDC needed to fight the HIV/AIDS crisis. The George W Bush administration put restrictions on global and domestic HIV prevention and reproductive health programming. The Trump administration further chipped away at the CDC's capacity to combat infectious diseases. CDC staff in China were cut back with the last remaining CDC officer recalled home from the China CDC in July, 2019, leaving an intelligence vacuum when COVID-19 began to emerge. In a press conference on Feb 25, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned US citizens to prepare for major disruptions to movement and everyday life. Messonnier subsequently no longer appeared at White House briefings on COVID-19. More recently, the Trump administration has questioned guidelines that the CDC has provided. These actions have undermined the CDC's leadership and its work during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no doubt that the CDC has made mistakes, especially on testing in the early stages of the pandemic. The agency was so convinced that it had contained the virus that it retained control of all diagnostic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but this was followed by the admission on Feb 12 that the CDC had developed faulty test kits. The USA is still nowhere near able to provide the basic surveillance or laboratory testing infrastructure needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. But punishing the agency by marginalising and hobbling it is not the solution. The Administration is obsessed with magic bullets—vaccines, new medicines, or a hope that the virus will simply disappear. But only a steadfast reliance on basic public health principles, like test, trace, and isolate, will see the emergency brought to an end, and this requires an effective national public health agency. The CDC needs a director who can provide leadership without the threat of being silenced and who has the technical capacity to lead today's complicated effort. The Trump administration's further erosion of the CDC will harm global cooperation in science and public health, as it is trying to do by defunding WHO. A strong CDC is needed to respond to public health threats, both domestic and international, and to help prevent the next inevitable pandemic. Americans must put a president in the White House come January, 2021, who will understand that public health should not be guided by partisan politics.

DOI:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31095-3,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31095-3,Editorial,COVID-19 in Brazil: “So what?”," The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reached Latin America later than other continents. The first case recorded in Brazil was on Feb 25, 2020. But now, Brazil has the most cases and deaths in Latin America (105 222 cases and 7288 deaths as of May 4), and these are probably substantial underestimates. Even more worryingly, the doubling of the rate of deaths is estimated at only 5 days and a recent study by Imperial College (London, UK), which analysed the active transmission rate of COVID-19 in 48 countries, showed that Brazil is the country with the highest rate of transmission (R0 of 2·81). Large cities such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the main hotspots now but there are concerns and early signs that infections are moving inland into smaller cities with inadequate provisions of intensive care beds and ventilators. Yet, perhaps the biggest threat to Brazil's COVID-19 response is its president, Jair Bolsonaro. When asked by journalists last week about the rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, he responded: “So what? What do you want me to do?” He not only continues to sow confusion by openly flouting and discouraging the sensible measures of physical distancing and lockdown brought in by state governors and city mayors but has also lost two important and influential ministers in the past 3 weeks. First, on April 16, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the respected and well liked Health Minister, was sacked after a television interview, in which he strongly criticised Bolsonaro's actions and called for unity, or else risk leaving the 210 million Brazilians utterly confused. Then on April 24, following the removal of the head of Brazil's federal police by Bolsonaro, Justice Minister Sérgio Moro, one of the most powerful figures of the right-wing government and appointed by Bolsonaro to combat corruption, announced his resignation. Such disarray at the heart of the administration is a deadly distraction in the middle of a public health emergency and is also a stark sign that Brazil's leadership has lost its moral compass, if it ever had one. Even without the vacuum of political actions at federal level, Brazil would have a difficult time to combat COVID-19. About 13 million Brazilians live in favelas, often with more than three people per room and little access to clean water. Physical distancing and hygiene recommendations are near impossible to follow in these environments—many favelas have organised themselves to implement measures as best as possible. Brazil has a large informal employment sector with many sources of income no longer an option. The Indigenous population has been under severe threat even before the COVID-19 outbreak because the government has been ignoring or even encouraging illegal mining and logging in the Amazon rainforest. These loggers and miners now risk bringing COVID-19 to remote populations. An open letter on May 3 by a global coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists, and intellectuals, organised by the Brazilian photojournalist Sebastião Salgado, warns of an impending genocide. What are the health and science community and civil society doing in a country known for its activism and outspoken opposition to injustice and inequity and with health as a constitutional right? Many scientific organisations, such as the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and ABRASCO, have long-opposed Bolsonaro because of severe cuts in the science budget and a more general demolition of social security and public services. In the context of COVID-19, many organisations have launched manifestos aimed at the public—such as Pact for Life and Brazil—and written statements and pleas to government officials calling for unity and joined up solutions. Pot-banging from balconies as protest during presidential announcements happens frequently. There is much research going on, from basic science to epidemiology, and there is rapid production of personal protective equipment, respirators, and testing kits. These are hopeful actions. Yet, leadership at the highest level of government is crucial in quickly averting the worst outcome of this pandemic, as is evident from other countries. In our 2009 Brazil Series, the authors concluded: “The challenge is ultimately political, requiring continuous engagement by Brazilian society as a whole to secure the right to health for all Brazilian people.” Brazil as a country must come together to give a clear answer to the “So what?” by its President. He needs to drastically change course or must be the next to go.

Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) was defined by presence of circulatory dysfunction, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation criteria. Current or previous infection was sought by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, and by serological qualitative test detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively.FindingsGroup 1 comprised 19 patients (seven boys, 12 girls; aged 3·0 years [SD 2·5]) diagnosed between Jan 1, 2015, and Feb 17, 2020. Group 2 included ten patients (seven boys, three girls; aged 7·5 years [SD 3·5]) diagnosed between Feb 18 and April 20, 2020; eight of ten were positive for IgG or IgM, or both.

The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing COVID-19, has rapidly spread worldwide. Italy was the first European country to be affected, with the outbreak estimated to have started in February, 2020. Currently, Italy has reported 132 547 COVID-19-positive cases, 51 534 of which are in Lombardy.1Ministero della SaluteNuovo coronavirus: cosa c'è da sapere.http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/Date accessed: April 15, 2020Google Scholar It is estimated that at least 10% of the Italian population—ie, approximately 1 million people—have been exposed to the virus.2Flaxman S Mishra S Gandy A et al.Estimating the number of infections and the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in 11 European countries.https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-13-europe-npi-impact/Date accessed: March 30, 2020Google Scholar The city of Bergamo has the highest rate of infections and deaths in Italy, which makes the province of Bergamo a natural epidemiological setting where SARS-CoV-2 infections appeared earlier and were more evident.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyKawasaki disease is an acute self-limiting vasculitis with specific predilection for the coronary arteries that affects previously healthy young infants and children. Despite half a century having passed since Kawasaki disease was first reported in Japan, the cause of this condition remains unknown. We did a PubMed database search to identify studies investigating the cause and pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease using the terms “Kawasaki disease”, “etiology”, “pathogenesis”, “intravenous immunoglobulin”, “corticosteroids”, “macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)”, and “KD shock syndrome”. All relevant articles were evaluated. The most accepted pathogenetic hypothesis supports an aberrant response of the immune system to one or more unidentified pathogens in genetically predisposed subjects. An infectious trigger, however, has not been identified.Added value of this studyShortly after the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to our region (Bergamo, Italy), we found a 30-fold increased incidence of Kawasaki disease. Children diagnosed after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic began showed evidence of immune response to the virus, were older, had a higher rate of cardiac involvement, and features of MAS. We therefore showed that SARS-CoV-2 might cause a severe form of Kawasaki-like disease.Implications of all the available evidenceOutbreaks of Kawasaki-like disease might occur in countries affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and might present outside the classic Kawasaki disease phenotype. This condition might be serious and requires prompt and more aggressive management. Future research on the cause of Kawasaki disease and similar syndromes should focus on immune responses to viral triggers.

Future research on the cause of Kawasaki disease and similar syndromes should focus on immune responses to viral triggers. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and features of new cases of Kawasaki-like presentations admitted to our unit during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. We retrospectively reviewed the notes of patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease admitted to the General Paediatric Unit of Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII (Bergamo, Italy), between Jan 1, 2015, and April 20, 2020. Our unit is a tertiary paediatric referral centre with approximately 1300 paediatric admissions per year, serving a province of approximately 1 million people, and hosting the largest Italian paediatric liver transplant programme and the largest paediatric intensive care unit of northern Italy (16 beds). In the general paediatric unit, there are paediatric consultants fully trained in all paediatric subspecialties. Patients with Kawasaki-like presentations were defined according to the 2017 criteria of the American Heart Association, including both the classic type (fever for ≥5 days plus four or more clinical criteria, including bilateral bulbar non-exudative conjunctivitis, changes of the lips or oral cavity, non-suppurative laterocervical lymphadenopathy, polymorphic rash, erythema of the palms and soles, firm induration of the hands or feet, or both) and incomplete types. In incomplete types (fever for ≥5 days plus two or three of the aforementioned clinical criteria), the values of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), or both, were taken as an additional diagnostic criterion in association with the presence of anaemia, thrombocytosis after 7 days of fever, hypoalbuminaemia, hypertransaminasaemia, leucocytosis, sterile pyuria, or an echocardiogram showing coronary aneurysms or cardiac dysfunction (ie, left ventricular function depression, mitral valve regurgitation, or pericardial effusion).17McCrindle BW Rowley AH Newburger JW et al.Diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of Kawasaki disease: a scientific statement for health professionals from the American Heart Association.Circulation. 2017; 135: e927-e999Google Scholar All patients were diagnosed and managed by LV, who has been in charge of paediatric rheumatology in the Paediatric Department since 2010. KDSS was defined as Kawasaki disease accompanied by systolic arterial hypotension, a decrease from basal systolic blood pressure of at least 20%, or the appearance of signs of peripheral hypoperfusion.14Kanegaye JT Wilder MS Molkara D et al.Recognition of a Kawasaki disease shock syndrome.Pediatrics. 2009; 123: e783-e789Google Scholar Ejection fraction, and concentrations of troponin I and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) were measured and used as indirect signs of myocarditis and heart failure.

The MAS criteria are validated for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but they are commonly used for other systemic autoinflammatory diseases such as Kawasaki disease and paediatric systemic lupus erythematosus.19García-Pavón S Yamazaki-Nakashimada MA Báez M Borjas-Aguilar KL Murata C Kawasaki disease complicated with macrophage activation syndrome: a systematic review.J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2017; 39: 445-451Google Scholar We divided the patients in two groups according to the date of presentation: group 1, presenting during the 5 years preceding the local SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (ie, Jan 1, 2015, to Feb 17, 2020); and group 2, presenting thereafter (ie, Feb 18 to April 20, 2020). Data were obtained from hospital medical records, and included demographic data, presenting symptoms and history of previous treatments, contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, vital signs, and laboratory data, including white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, ESR, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, fibrinogen, proBNP, troponin I, natural killer (NK) activity, and concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6). Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were done in all children. Patients and caregivers had nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling, testing SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid using reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR assay; patients with a positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling test were considered confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients diagnosed more recently had a test for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM and IgG) through a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay (NADAL COVID-19 IgG/IgM Test, Nal Von Minden, Moers, Germany). Positivity for IgM or IgG, or both, was considered consistent with an earlier infection with SARS-CoV-2. Risk of resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was ascertained according to the Kobayashi score.20Kobayashi T Saji T Otani T et al.Efficacy of immunoglobulin plus prednisolone for prevention of coronary artery abnormalities in severe Kawasaki disease (RAISE study): a randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoints trial.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1613-1620Google Scholar All patients were administered intravenous immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg.

Aspirin was maintained until 48 h after defervescence, and then continued at an antiplatelet dose of 3–5 mg/kg per day for 8 weeks.20Kobayashi T Saji T Otani T et al.Efficacy of immunoglobulin plus prednisolone for prevention of coronary artery abnormalities in severe Kawasaki disease (RAISE study): a randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoints trial.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1613-1620Google Scholar The schedule for patients at risk of intravenous immunglobulin resistance was adopted also in patients with KDSS or MAS. Response to treatment was defined as the normalisation of vital signs, CRP, and blood tests, and the resolution of symptoms and signs. The Student's t test, the χ2 method, and Fisher's exact test were done when appropriate for statistical analysis to compare continuous and categorical variables. A p value of <0·05 was chosen as cutoff for significance. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 20.0) and GraphPad Prism (version 5.00 for Mac). The study was approved by the Bergamo Ethics Committee (registration number 37/20, 25/03/2020). There was no funding source for this study.

Between Feb 18 and April 20, 2020, ten patients (aged 7·5 years [SD 3·5]; seven boys, three girls), were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease (incidence ten per month), and comprised group 2. Admission to hospital occurred, on average, on day 6 of fever (range 4–8). Five (50%) patients presented with a classic form of the disease, and five (50%) presented with an incomplete form. Patients presenting with the classic form had non-exudative conjunctivitis, hand and feet anomalies (ie, erythema or firm induration, or both), and polymorphic rash. Four (80%) of five patients had associated changes of the lips or oral cavity, or both; patient 7 also had laterocervical lymphadenopathy (table 1).Table 1Clinical and laboratory features of ten patients with Kawasaki-like disease who presented over 1 month during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (group 2)Patient 1Patient 2Patient 3Patient 4Patient 5Patient 6Patient 7Patient 8Patient 9Patient 10Date of onsetMarch 17, 2020March 27, 2020March 28, 2020April 3, 2020April 3, 2020April 4, 2020April 6, 2020April 10, 2020April 11, 2020April 14, 2020Age, years8·27·02·97·77·516·05·09·25·55·5SexMaleMaleFemaleFemaleFemaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleType of Kawasaki diseaseIncompleteIncompleteClassicIncompleteIncompleteClassicClassicIncompleteClassicClassicOther symptom..Diarrhoea, meningeal signs..Diarrhoea, meningeal signsDiarrhoeaDiarrhoeaMeningeal signsDiarrhoeaMeningeal signsDiarrhoea, drowsinessESR, mm/h..603910897..51848154Lymphocytes, × 109 per L80310609709304507901870860420460Blood culture..SterileSterileSterileSterileSterileSterileSterileSterileSterileChest x-rayPneumoniaPneumoniaPneumoniaNormalNormalNormalNormalPneumoniaNormalPneumoniaEchocardiographyAbnormalNormalNormalAbnormalAbnormalAbnormalNormalAbnormalNormalAbnormalAneurism>4 mmNoNoNoNoNoNo>4 mmNoNoEjection fraction48%>55%>55%25%30%>55%>55%40%>55%45%Mitral valve regurgitationYesNoNoYesYesNoNoYesNoNoPericardial effusionYesNoNoYesYesYesNoNoNoNoKobayashi ≥5Yes (6)Yes (6)No (4)Yes (6)Yes (6)No (3)No (2)Yes (6)Yes (6)Yes (6)<12 monthsNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoKawasaki disease signs at day 4NoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoCRP ≥10 mg/dLYes (0·9)Yes (31·1)Yes (15·2)Yes (48·0)Yes (52·5)No (7·3)Yes (24·0)Yes (24·2)Yes (24·6)Yes (12·2)Neutrophils ≥80%Yes (80·0)Yes (89·7)No (77·3)Yes (90·0)Yes (90·5)No (79·4)No (77·9)Yes (91·9)Yes (85·5)Yes (83·0)Platelets ≤300 × 109 per LYes (119)Yes (121)Yes (66)Yes (142)Yes (113)Yes (121)Yes (138)Yes (192)Yes (151)Yes (142)Sodium ≤133 mEq/LYes (131)Yes (130)Yes (132)Yes (128)Yes (129)No (135)No (135)Yes (133)Yes (133)Yes (122)ALT ≥100 U/LNo (32)No (79)No (46)No (82)No (78)Yes (733)No (41)No (63)No (20)No (20)MAS18Ravelli A Minoia F Davì S et al.2016 Classification criteria for macrophage activation syndrome complicating systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology/Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation Collaborative Initiative.Ann Rheum Dis. 2016; 75: 481-489Google Scholar..YesYesYesYesYesNoNoNoNoFerritin >684 ng/mL..Yes (1183)Yes (893)Yes (1972)Yes (3213)Yes (2027)No (199)No (449)No (307)No (341)Platelets ≤181 × 109 per LYes (119)Yes (121)Yes (66)Yes (142)Yes (113)Yes (121)Yes (138)No (192)Yes (151)Yes (142)AST >48 IU/LNo (30)Yes (120)Yes (63)Yes (174)Yes (89)Yes (237)Yes (50)Yes (51)No (29)No (30)Triglycerides ≥156 mg/dL−Yes (434)Yes (367)Yes (263)Yes (198)..Yes (161)Yes (200)Yes (171)No (121)Fibrinogen ≤360 mg/dLNo (465)No (599)No (506)No (924)No (759)Yes (313)No (637)No (759)No (759)No (489)KDSS14Kanegaye JT Wilder MS Molkara D et al.Recognition of a Kawasaki disease shock syndrome.Pediatrics. 2009; 123: e783-e789Google ScholarNoNoNoYesYesYesNoYesNoYesHypotensionNoNoNoYesYesYesNoYesNoYesSBP ≤20% basalNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoPeripheral hypoperfusionNoNoNoYesYesNoNoYesNoYesCPK, nv 461–71 IU/L1684762478911979405940Troponin I, nv ≤53 ng/L111188−200355749061236<323proBNP, nv 1–00 ng/L18709521519207216651083472957139927Nasal swab for respiratory pathogensNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNasal swab for SARS-CoV-2NegativePositiveNegativeNegativePositiveNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativeSerology for SARS-CoV-2 (IgG, IgM)Negative, negativePositive, negativePositive, negativePositive, positivePositive, positiveNegative, negative** Test done shortly after high-dose IVIG.Positive, negativePositive, negativePositive, positivePositive, negativeSerology (days from onset)3018161111108746Contact with suspected or confirmed caseNoYesNoNoYesNoYesNoYesYesCaregiver nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2..PositiveNegativeNegativeNegativeNegativePositiveNegativeNegativePositiveTreatmentIVIG plus aspirinIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus aspirinIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNIVIG plus mPDNInotropesNoNoNoYesYesNoNoNoNoNoResponseYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesESR=erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

In two (20%) patients, the echocardiography detected a left coronary aneurysm (>4 mm), reduced ejection fraction (48% and 40%), and mitral valve regurgitation; patient 1 also had pericardial effusion. Patient 2 met the diagnosis with four additional laboratory criteria (ie, hypoalbuminaemia, hypertransaminasaemia, leucocytosis, and sterile pyuria). Patients 4 and 5 diagnosed with incomplete Kawasaki disease, presented with non-exudative conjunctivitis associated with changes in the lips and oral cavity (patient 4), or polymorphic rash (patient 5). In these patients, echocardiography revealed left ventricular function depression, mitral valve regurgitation, and pericardial effusion; they also required inotropic support. Patient 4 had an underlying diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Chest x-ray, done in all patients in group 2, was positive in five (50%) patients for minimal mono or bilateral infiltrates. Patients 1 and 10 had a chest CT and a confirmed bibasilar pulmonary thickening. Patients 2 and 7, who had meningeal signs, had an electroencephalogram that showed a slow wave pattern; patient 7 had a lumbar puncture revealing normal cerebrospinal fluid and the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Five (50%) of ten patients in group 2 met the criteria for KDSS because of hypotension and clinical signs of hypoperfusion. Two (20%) patients had diarrhoea and meningeal signs, four (40%) had only diarrhoea, and two (20%) had only meningeal signs (table 1). Mean ESR was 72 mm/h (SD 24), mean CRP 25 mg/dL (SD 15·3), and mean ferritin 1176 ng/mL (SD 1032). Full blood count showed a mean white cell count of 10·8 × 109 per L (SD 6·1), with increased neutrophil percentage in eight patients (84·5% [SD 5·7]), lymphopenia in eight patients (0·86 × 109 per L [SD 0·40]), and thrombocytopenia in eight patients (130 × 109 per L [32]). Hyponatraemia (≤133 mEq/L) was observed in eight patients (131 mEq/L [SD 4]) and a slight increase in transaminases was recorded in seven patients (aspartate aminotransferase 87 U/L [SD 70]; alanine aminotransferase 119 U/L [217]). Hypertriglyceridaemia was shown in seven (87%) of eight tested patients in group 2 (239 mg/dL [SD 108]); fibrinogen was high in nine (90%) of ten patients (621 mg/dL [182]), as was D-dimer in eight (80%) of ten patients (3798 ng/mL [SD 1318]). Laboratory criteria predicted intravenous immunoglobulin-resistance in seven (70%) of ten patients. MAS was diagnosed in five (50%) of ten patients. Troponin I was elevated in five (55%) of nine tested patients (1004 ng/L [SD 1862]), creatine phosphokinase in one (10%) of ten patients (85 IU/L [64]), and proBNP in all ten patients (1255 ng/L [929]; Table 1, Table 2).Table 2Comparison between patients with Kawasaki-like disease presenting before and after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemicGroup 1Group 2p valueTime of presentationUntil February, 2020March–April, 2020NANumber of patients1910NAAge at onset, years3·0 (2·5)7·5 (3·5)0·00035Incidence0·3 per month10 per month<0·00001SexNANA0·13Female123NAMale77NAIncomplete Kawasaki disease6/19 (31%)5/10 (50%)0·43CRP, mg/dL16·3 (8·0)25 (15·3)0·05ESR, mm/h82 (29)72 (24)0·38White cell count, × 109 per L19·4 (6·4)10·8 (6·1)0·0017Neutrophils71·9% (17·2)84·5% (5·7)0·034Lymphocytes, × 109 per L3·0 (1·8)0·86 (0·4)0·0012Haemoglobin, g/dL10·8 (2·0)11 (1·2)0·79Platelets, × 109 per L457 (96)130 (32)<0·00001Albumin, g/dLl3·3 (0·5)3·2 (0·3)0·55Sodium, mEq/L134·7 (1·6)130·8 (3·9)0·0011AST, U/L120 (218)87 (70)0·64ALT, U/L92 (122)119 (217)0·67Ferritin, ng/mL187 (89)1176 (1032)0·011Triglycerides, mg/dL..239 (108)..Fibrinogen, mg/dL543 (300)621 (182)0·51D-dimer, ng/mL3244 (943)3798 (1318)0·52CPK, IU/L61 (28)85 (64)0·19Troponin I, ng/L..1004 (1862)..proBNP, ng/L..1255 (929)..Kobayashi score ≥52/19 (10%)7/10 (70%)0·0021MAS18Ravelli A Minoia F Davì S et al.2016 Classification criteria for macrophage activation syndrome complicating systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology/Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation Collaborative Initiative.Ann Rheum Dis. 2016; 75: 481-489Google Scholar0/10 (0%)5/10 (50%)0·021KDSS14Kanegaye JT Wilder MS Molkara D et al.Recognition of a Kawasaki disease shock syndrome.Pediatrics. 2009; 123: e783-e789Google Scholar0/10 (0%)5/10 (50%)0·021Abnormal echocardiography2/19 (10%)6/10 (60%)0·0089Adjunctive steroid treatment4/19 (16%)8/10 (80%)0·0045Inotropes treatment0/19 (0%)2/10 (20%)0·11Response to treatment19/19 (100%)10/10 (100%)1Data are mean (SD) or n/N (%), unless otherwise stated.

NK count was measured in four (40%) patients, and was reduced in all (62 [SD 35]; nv 200–600 × 109 per L). Blood culture was sterile in all patients. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling for SARS-CoV-2, available from Feb 24, 2020, was positive in two (20%) of ten patients in group 2 (table 1). All patients were tested at least twice. Serology for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, available from April 13, 2020, was investigated in all patients in group 2; eight (80%) of ten patients were IgG positive, and three were also IgM positive. Patient 6, who had a negative serology, was tested shortly after the infusion of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (table 1). On April 14, 2020, 31 health-care personnel from the Paediatric Department, Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII (Bergamo, Italy) had serology testing. Nine (29%) of 31 were IgG positive, and three (10%) were also IgM positive, corresponding to the expected rate of exposure of our local heath-care personnel to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, two patients from group 1 diagnosed before the start of the epidemic were contacted and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and both were negative. To date, all patients in group 2 have been discharged, treatment with aspirin at an antiplatelet dose is ongoing, and a follow-up echocardiogram is scheduled at 8 weeks. From Jan 1, 2015, to the start of the epidemic on Feb 17, 2020, 19 children were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease (incidence 0·3 per month; mean age 3 years [SD 2·5]; seven boys, 12 girls); these patients comprised group 1. Admission to hospital occurred, on average, on day 6 of fever (range 4–11 days). 13 (68%) of 19 patients presented with a classic form of the disease, and six (31%) of 19 with an incomplete form. None of the patients had hypotension, clinical signs of hypoperfusion, or other atypical symptoms. Laboratory criteria predicted intravenous immunoglobulin resistance in two (10%) of 19 patients. MAS was not diagnosed in any of the patients. A full comparison of clinical and biochemical characteristics of the two groups is provided in table 2. All patients included had a favourable outcome. Patients in group 1 had concluded their treatment and follow-up period, and recovered completely with no residual coronary artery aneurisms. Group 1 comprised 19 patients diagnosed over 5 years, whereas group 2 included ten patients diagnosed over 1 month (incidence 0·3 per month vs ten per month; p<0·0001; table 2; figure). To rule out the possible effect of number of referrals to the emergency department in different periods, we calculated incidence corrected for number of patients seen at the emergency department. We found that in the past 5 years, from January, 2015, to December, 2019, 98 572 patients had been evaluated, with a mean of 1642 (SD 280) per month, compared with 283 patients per month during the study period—approximately six-fold lower. With these figures, the incidence of Kawasaki disease in group 1 was 0·019% (95% CI −0·002 to 0·0019), compared with 3·5% (−3·5 to 3·6) in group 2 (odds ratio 184; p<0·0001; figure). To rule out the possible effect of a change in the geographical catchment area in the prepandemic (group 1) versus the pandemic (group 2) period, we reviewed the place of residence of all our patients with Kawasaki disease and drew a referral map, showing that all but one came from the Bergamo province (appendix p 1).FigureIncidence of Kawasaki disease in the study period and in the past 5 yearsShow full caption(A) Frequency of Kawasaki disease at the paediatric emergency department of Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo, Italy, in the past 5 years, by case severity.

The average age at onset was 3·0 years (SD 2·5) in group 1 versus 7·5 years (3·5) in group 2 (p=0·0003). In group 1, 14 of 19 patients were white, versus eight of ten patients in group 2. The mean body-mass index of patients in group 1 was 15·93 kg/m2 (SD 1·72) versus 19·11 kg/m2 (SD 3·21) in group 2 (p=0·0016). Two patients tested in group 1 had a negative serology for SARS-CoV-2 versus eight of ten positive patients in group 2 (one of the two negative patients was tested after high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin); five (50%) of ten patients had been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Group 2 had a significantly lower white cell count, lymphocyte count, and platelet count when compared with group 1 (table 2). Group 2 also differed significantly from group 1 for increased rate of markers of severity. An abnormal echocardiogram was recorded in six (60%) of ten patients of group 2 versus two (10%) of 19 patients in group 1 (p=0·0089); fulfilment of criteria for KDSS and MAS was found in five (50%) of ten patients in group 2, and in none of the patients in group 1 (p=0·021). Seven (70%) patients in group 2 met the criteria for a Kobayashi score of 5 or more, compared with two (10%) of 19 patients in group 1 (p=0·0021). Adjunctive steroid treatment was required in four (16%) of 19 patients in group 1 versus eight (80%) of ten patients in group 2 (p=0·0045; table 2).

Group 2, diagnosed after SARS-CoV-2 appeared, showed evidence of seroconversion to the virus in the majority of patients. In the past 20 years, viruses of the coronavirus family have been proposed as possibly implicated in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease. In 2005, a group from New Haven (CT, USA)29Esper F Shapiro ED Weibel C Ferguson D Landry ML Kahn JS Association between a novel human coronavirus and Kawasaki disease.J Infect Dis. 2005; 191: 499-502Google Scholar identified a novel human coronavirus, designated New Haven coronavirus (HCoV-NH), in the respiratory secretions of eight of 11 children with Kawasaki disease versus one of 22 controls tested by RT-PCR.

This report was followed by commentaries expressing a mixed sense of interest and scepticism.30McIntosh K Coronaviruses in the limelight.J Infect Dis. 2005; 191: 489-491Google Scholar The arguments against this association were expressed by a group from Japan, who did a retrospective study31Ebihara T Endo R Ma X Ishiguro N Kikuta H Lack of association between New Haven coronavirus and Kawasaki disease.J Infect Dis. 2005; 192: 351-352Google Scholar,  32Esper F Shapiro ED Landry ML Kahn JS Reply to van der Hoek and Berkhout, Ebihara et al., and Belay et al.J Infect Dis. 2005; 192: 353Google Scholar,  33Turnier JL Anderson MS Heizer HR Jone PN Glodé MP Dominguez SR Concurrent respiratory viruses and Kawasaki disease.Pediatrics. 2015; 136: e609-e614Google Scholar on nasopharyngeal swab samples from 19 children with Kawasaki disease and 208 controls with respiratory tract infections, and found RNA sequences of HCoV-NH in five (2%) of 208 controls versus zero of 19 children with Kawasaki disease. Another group from Japan explored the association between two different coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) and Kawasaki disease by serological tests. The immunofluorescence assay detected no difference in HCoV-NL63 antibody positivity between patients and controls, whereas HCoV-229E antibody positivity was higher in patients with Kawasaki disease.34Shirato K Imada Y Kawase M Nakagaki K Matsuyama S Taguchi F Possible involvement of infection with human coronavirus 229E, but not NL63, in Kawasaki disease.J Med Virol. 2014; 86: 2146-2153Google Scholar Given the pathogenesis of the disease, serology testing seems a more reliable tool than RT-PCR in detecting the cause of infection. This suggests that the coronavirus family might represent one of the triggers of Kawasaki disease, SARS-CoV-2 being a particularly virulent strain able to elicit a powerful immune response in the host. In this study, the clinical and biochemical features of patients with Kawasaki disease diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to differ from our historical cohort of patients; therefore, we have classified these patients as Kawasaki-like disease. From a clinical perspective, they were older, had respiratory and gastrointestinal involvement, meningeal signs, and signs of cardiovascular involvement. From a biochemical perspective, they had leucopenia with marked lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased ferritin, as well as markers of myocarditis. Similar clinical features are shared by patients with COVID-19.4Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Additionally, these patients had a more severe disease course, with resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin and need of adjunctive steroids, biochemical evidence of MAS, and clinical signs in keeping with KDSS.

In our experience, this treatment is effective and safe, and should be considered by physicians treating patients with Kawasaki-like presentations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence of contact with the virus was confirmed by the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in eight of ten patients in group 2. It is possible that in the remaining two patients, who both had a negative serology, confounding factors played a role. One patient was tested just after an infusion of high-dose immunoglobulins. Additionally, qualitative antibody testing is reported to have a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 85–90% when compared with PCR test by nasal swab. It is also possible that this patient represents an usual presentation of Kawasaki disease outside of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, as seen in previous years. Only two patients in group 2 presented a positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling for SARS-CoV-2. This finding and the positivity of IgG antibodies suggest a late onset of the disease compared with the primary infection, due to the host immune response. This might be the reason why, in the past, no active viral infection could be shown in this disease. All these results and considerations support the hypothesis that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a Kawasaki-like disease in susceptible patients. We believe these findings have important implications for public health. The association between SARS-CoV-2 and Kawasaki-like disease should be taken into account when it comes to considering social reintegration policies for the paediatric population. However, the Kawasaki-like disease described here remains a rare condition, probably affecting no more than one in 1000 children exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This estimate is based on the limited data from the case series in this region. This study has the limitations of a relatively small case series, requiring confirmation in larger groups. Genetic studies investigating the susceptibility of patients developing this disease to the triggering effect of SARS-CoV-2 should be done. Nonetheless, we reported a strong association between an outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease and the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the Bergamo province of Italy. Patients diagnosed with Kawasaki-like disease after the viral spreading revealed a severe course, including KDSS and MAS, and required adjunctive steroid treatment. A similar outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease is expected in countries affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

The combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days [IQR 5–11]) than the control group (12 days [8–15]; hazard ratio 4·37 [95% CI 1·86–10·24], p=0·0010). Adverse events included self-limited nausea and diarrhoea with no difference between the two groups. One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir–ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis. No patients died during the study. Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted.

Many repurposed drugs have been shown to have in-vitro activity against the close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, which are all beta-coronaviruses. Lopinavir and many interferons, particularly interferon beta, have been shown to have modest activity in vitro against SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and can be used synergistically with ribavirin.5Chen F Chan KH Jiang Y et al.In vitro susceptibility of 10 clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus to selected antiviral compounds.J Clin Virol. 2004; 31: 69-75Google Scholar,  6Chan JF Chan KH Kao RY et al.Broad-spectrum antivirals for the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect. 2013; 67: 606-616Google Scholar In 2003, we did an open-label trial using historical controls, and showed that a combination of lopinavir–ritonavir with ribavirin reduced the mortality and need for intensive respiratory support of patients with SARS who had been admitted to hospital.7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar Moreover, lopinavir–ritonavir or interferon beta-1b has been shown to reduce viral load and improve lung pathology in a common marmoset model.8Chan JF Yao Y Yeung ML et al.Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir or interferon-β1b improves outcome of MERS-CoV infection in a nonhuman primate model of common marmoset.J Infect Dis. 2015; 212: 1904-1913Google Scholar However the viral load of SARS and MERS peaks at around day 7–10 after symptom onset, whereas the viral load of COVID-19 peaks at the time of presentation, similar to influenza.9To KK-W Tsang OT-Y Leung W-S et al.Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online March 23.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30196-1Google Scholar,  10Cheng VC Tang BS Wu AK Chu CM Yuen KY Medical treatment of viral pneumonia including SARS in immunocompetent adult.J Infect. 2004; 49: 262-273Google Scholar Experience from the treatment of patients with influenza who are admitted to hospital suggested that a combination of multiple antiviral drugs is more effective than single drug treatments in this setting of patients with a high viral load at presentation.11Dunning J Baillie JK Cao B Hayden FG Antiviral combinations for severe influenza.Lancet Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 1259-1270Google Scholar,  12Hung IFN To KKW Chan JFW et al.Efficacy of clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination in the treatment of patients hospitalized for influenza A(H3N2) infection: an open-label randomized, controlled, phase IIb/III trial.Chest. 2017; 151: 1069-1080Google Scholar Therefore, we did this phase 2 randomised trial to establish whether a combination of three modestly active drugs against SARS-CoV-2 can improve the viral load profile and clinical parameters in adults with COVID-19 requiring hospital admission. Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on March 30, 2020, using the terms “Covid-19”, “interferon beta 1b”, “lopinavir/ ritonavir”, “treatment”, “hospitalized”, “patients”, “phase 2”, and “trial” for articles in English published up to the date of the search. Our search did not show any randomised controlled trials assessing a combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Added value of this studyThis is the first randomised controlled trial on the triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin, compared with single-drug lopinavir–ritonavir in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Treatment with the triple combination effectively suppressed viral load in all clinical specimens, including the nasopharyngeal swab, throat saliva, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and stool in most patients 8 days from treatment commencement, which was significantly shorter than the time taken in the control group, treated with lopinavir–ritonavir alone. The triple combination also alleviated symptoms completely within 4 days—a significantly shorter time than the control. The triple combination also suppressed IL-6 levels. The clinical and virological efficacy resulted in shorter hospital stays and facilitated infection control. This treatment regimen was also shown to be safe, with minor and self-limiting gastrointestinal adverse events of diarrhoea and vomiting. Increased liver enzymes were uncommon, and resolved upon stopping the medications.Implications of all the available evidenceThis study showed that early treatment with the triple combination of antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin is safe and highly effective in shortening the duration of virus shedding, decreasing cytokine responses, alleviating symptoms, and facilitating the discharge of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Furthermore, the triple antiviral therapy rapidly rendered viral load negative in all specimens, thereby reducing infectiousness of the patient.

Furthermore, the triple antiviral therapy rapidly rendered viral load negative in all specimens, thereby reducing infectiousness of the patient. This was a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial. Adult patients aged at least 18 years admitted to hospital from Feb 10, 2020, for virologically confirmed COVID-19, were recruited from the Queen Mary Hospital, Pamela Youde Nethersole Hospital, Ruttonjee Hospital, United Christian Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and Tuen Mun Hospital in Hong Kong. These six major public hospitals are positioned across five of the seven hospital clusters, and serve 75% of the 7·5 million population. Public health ordinance in Hong Kong required all patients tested positive for COVID-19 be admitted to hospital. Eligibility criteria for the study were age at least 18 years, a national early warning score 2 (NEWS2) of at least 1, and symptom duration of 14 days or less upon recruitment (appendix pp 9–10). The institutional review board of the University of Hong Kong Hospital Authority approved this study (UW20–074). All patients gave written consent for participation in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to either the triple combination lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta-1b group or the control group (lopinavir–ritonavir only), in the ratio of 2:1, by simple randomisation with no stratification. Randomised treatment was open-label. Patients were assigned to a serial number by the study coordinator. Each serial number was linked to a computer-generated randomisation list assigning the antiviral treatment regimens. The study medications were dispensed by the hospital pharmacy and then to the patients by the medical ward nurses. In the combination group, patients who were recruited and treated less than 7 days from symptom onset received a triple combination of 14 days of oral lopinavir–ritonavir (lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg) every 12 h (via nasogastric tube to intubated patients), ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and subcutaneous injection of one to three doses of interferon beta-1b 1 mL (8 million international units [IU]) on alternate days depending on the day of drug commencement (if commenced on day 1–2 from symptom onset, the patient received all three doses of interferon beta-1b; if commenced on day 3–4, the patient received two doses; if commenced on day 5–6, the patient received one dose). For those recruited and treated between days 7 and 14, interferon beta-1b injection was omitted to avoid its proinflammatory effects. Patients assigned to the control group received only oral lopinavir–ritonavir (lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg) every 12 h for 14 days. For patients who had no history of prolonged QTc syndrome, but were found to have prolonged QTc less than 480 ms, first-degree heart block or bundle branch block, or bradycardia upon ECG examination, and those who developed increased alanine transaminase of three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), the lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was reduced to once per day. Lopinavir–ritonavir would be stopped if alanine transaminase levels exceeded six times the ULN. The randomisation window from symptom onset was extended from 10 to 14 days after trial commencement after knowing that the incubation period could go beyond 14 days. Because a placebo group was generally not accepted in Chinese culture, and our previous study showed that interferon beta-1b and lopinavir–ritonavir are active against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, lopinavir–ritonavir was used in the control group whereas interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin were used in the combination group for patients admitted less than 7 days from symptom onset. The intervention treatment had to be started within 48 h after hospital admission. Standard of care included oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, dialysis support, and antimicrobial treatment for secondary bacterial infection as indicated clinically. Stress doses of corticosteroid (50 mg hydrocortisone every 8 h intravenously, tapering over 7 days) were given to patients who developed oxygen desaturation and required oxygen support. Non-invasive or invasive ventilatory support beyond day 7 from symptom onset was at the discretion of the consultants. Clinical findings including history and physical examination, and laboratory and radiological investigation results were entered into a predesigned database. Chest radiograph and ECG were taken at baseline and at regular intervals for monitoring of patient progress and to detect early cardiac rhythm changes. Patients with underlying cardiac conditions were put on cardiac monitoring. High-resolution CT was done at the consultants' discretion. All patients were followed up at the infectious disease clinic within 30 days after discharge. Initial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made upon admission. All recruited patients had to have laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR in the nasopharyngeal swab. Daily nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, stool or rectal swabs, and urine if available, were obtained until discharge, for quantification of viral load and genetic mutation testing (appendix pp 20–23). Complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and cytokine profile were regularly checked until discharge (appendix p 21). Blood and urine samples for bacterial culture were taken when clinically indicated. The nasopharyngeal swab upon admission was assessed by BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 plus (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Methods for assays by quantitative RT-PCR, serum cytokine profiling, and nanopore sequencing for nsp5 mutation are in the appendix (pp 20–23). The primary endpoint was time to achieve a negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Secondary clinical endpoints were time to resolution of symptoms defined as a NEWS2 of 0 maintained for 24 h; daily NEWS2 and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; length of hospital stay; and 30-day mortality. Other virological endpoints included the time to achieve negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in all clinical samples, including nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, stool, and urine; daily viral load changes in the first 7 days; and emergence of amino acid mutations in the nsp5 gene encoding a 3C-like protease. The serum cytokine response was also measured. Safety endpoints were the frequencies and duration of adverse events. It is important to note that COVID-19 is a new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is phylogenetically closest to the 2003 SARS-CoV. At the time of study design in mid-January, 2020, there was insufficient information on the mortality of COVID-19. Thus, we based our sample size calculation on our own findings of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment in a trial on the 2003 SARS-CoV.7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar The current study was designed on the basis of an estimated difference of 26·4% in the 21-day mortality or acute respiratory distress syndrome rate in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, when treated with lopinavir–ritonavir (2·4%) versus historical controls without antiviral treatment (28·8%). The necessary sample size had been calculated to be 30 patients per group to detect such a difference at a two-sided α level of 0·05, with 80% power. The protocol proposed recruiting at least 35 patients per group to allow for a 17% dropout rate. The primary endpoint was assessed in the intention-to-treat population of all randomised patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned drug. Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test and continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, for both intention-to-treat and subgroup analyses. For viral load, specimens with undetectable viral load were assigned a value of 1 log10 copies per mL for the purpose of statistical analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model. Factors significant at univariable analysis (p<0·10) were further assessed by means of a multivariable analysis by Cox proportional hazards model to identify the independent factors for negative nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR on day 7 after treatment. A p value of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version 26.0 and PRISM, version 8.

The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Between Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 144 patients were screened, and 127 patients were recruited (figure 1). The number of patients screened accounted for 80% of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong during this period. Nine patients did not fulfil the inclusion criteria (four with second-degree and third-degree cardiac arrhythmia, two with severe depression, and three because of pregnancy) and eight patients declined the treatment regimen. One patient in the control group required discontinuation of lopinavir–ritonavir because of alanine transaminase six times greater than the ULN after 1 week of treatment. The median age was 52 years (IQR 32–62); 68 (54%) patients were men versus 59 (46%) women (table 1). 51 (40%) patients had underlying diseases. The median time to hospital admission from symptom onset was 5 days (IQR 3–7).Figure 1Trial profileView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT)Table 1Baseline demographics of the study populationCombination group (n=86)Control group (n=41)Age51·0 (31·0–61·3)52·0 (33·5–62·5)SexMen45 (52%)23 (56%)Women41 (48%)18 (44%)Time from symptoms onset to start of treatment, days5 (4–7)4 (3–8)Underlying diseasesDiabetes11 (13%)6 (15%)Hypertension23 (27%)13 (32%)Coronary artery disease5 (6%)5 (12%)Cerebrovascular disease1 (1%)1 (2%)Hyperlipidaemia18 (21%)11 (27%)Thyroid disease3 (3%)1 (2%)Obstructive sleep apnoea1 (1%)1 (2%)Crohn's disease1 (1%)0Epilepsy1 (1%)0Tuberculosis2 (2%)0Chronic hepatitis B2 (2%)1 (2%)Chronic hepatitis C01 (2%)Malignancy1 (1%)1 (2%)Smoker6 (7%)1 (2%)Symptoms and signsFever70 (81%)32 (78%)Chills13 (15%)6 (15%)Cough45 (52%)23 (56%)Sputum29 (34%)13 (32%)Shortness of breath7 (8%)7 (17%)Sore throat16 (19%)10 (24%)Myalgia10 (12%)8 (20%)Malaise19 (22%)5 (12%)Nausea or vomiting1 (1%)0Diarrhoea17 (20%)7 (17%)Rhinorrhoea14 (16%)10 (24%)Anosmia4 (5%)1 (2%)Headache3 (3%)3 (7%)Chest tightness2 (2%)0Anorexia1 (1%)0Baseline laboratory findings (normal range)Haemoglobin (11·5–14·8 g/dL)13·4 (12·7–14·9)13·5 (12·7–14·8)White cell count (3·89–9·93 × 109 per L)4·9 (3·7–6·2)5·4 (4·6–6·4)Neutrophils (2·01–7·42 × 109 per L)3·4 (2·4–4·3)3·5 (2·9–4·5)Lymphocytes (1·06–3·61 × 109 per L)1·0 (0·8–1·5)1·3 (0·9–1·6)Platelets (154–371 × 109 per L)195·0 (171·8–260·0)192·0 (160·5–244·5)Alanine aminotransferase (8–45 U/L)23·0 (15·0–33·3)26·0 (14·5–43·0)Alkaline phosphatase (42–110 U/L)58·0 (48·0–75·0)65·0 (52·5–75·0)Lactate dehydrogenase (143–280 U/L)194·0 (159·8–249·0)167·5 (142·0–200·0)Bilirubin (4–23 μmol/L)7·9 (5·5–9·0)7·5 (6·0–10·8)Creatinine (49–82 μmol/L)75·5 (65·0–92·0)76·0 (62·5–96·0)Urea (2·9–8·0 mmol/L)4·0 (2·9–4·8)3·7 (2·7–4·6)Creatine kinase (22–198 U/L)79·0 (50·0–151·0)90·5 (54·5–141·5)C-reactive protein (<0·76 mg/dL)3·0 (2·0–9·2)3·0 (1·5–7·2)Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (<12 mm/h)19·0 (11·0–48·0)19·0 (9·8–37·8)Baseline radiological findings (%)Abnormal chest x-ray64 (74%)32 (78%)Right upper zone infiltrate00 (0%)Right middle zone infiltrate4 (5%)6 (15%)Right lower zone infiltrate38 (44%)18 (44%)Left upper zone infiltrate1 (1%)0Left middle zone infiltrate7 (8%)7 (17%)Left lower zone infiltrate27 (31%)10 (24%)High-resolution CT (performed in 22 patients)14 (16%)6 (15%)Data are n (%) or median (IQR).

U/L=units per L. Among the 127 patients, 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 patients were assigned to the control group. Within the combination group, 52 patients were admitted to hospital less than 7 days from symptom onset and received the lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta-1b regimen, and 34 patients who were admitted 7 days or more after symptom onset received the lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin only regimen. The median number of doses of interferon beta-1b received was two. Median time from symptom onset to start of treatment was 5 days (4–7) for the combination group and 4 days (3–8) for the control group (table 1). The age, sex, and baseline demographics in each group were similar. Fever and unproductive cough were the most common presenting signs and symptoms. Both diarrhoea and anosmia were infrequent. Most patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate upon presentation. One patient in the combination group had concomitant rhinovirus infection upon presentation. Disease severity upon presentation was mild based on NEWS2 and SOFA scores (table 2).Table 2Clinical, viral load, and cytokine profile and concomitant treatmentsCombination group (n=86)Control group (n=41)p valueNEWS2Baseline2 (1–2)2 (2–2)0·52Day 11 (1–2)2 (2–2)<0·0001Day 21·0 (0·0–2·0)2·0 (1·5–3·0)<0·0001Day 30 (0–1)2 (1–3)<0·0001Day 40 (0–1)2 (1–2)<0·0001Day 50 (0–1)2 (1–2)<0·0001Day 60·0 (0·0–1·0)1·5 (1·0–2·0)<0·0001Day 70·0 (0·0–1·0)1·0 (0·8–2·0)0·0010Time to NEWS2 of 0, days4 (3–8)8 (7–9)<0·0001SOFA scoreBaseline0 (0–1)0 (0–1)0·38Day 10 (0–1)0 (1–1)0·21Day 20 (0–2)1 (0–2)0·025Day 30 (0–2)1 (0–2)0·010Day 40·0 (0·0–1·3)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·012Day 50 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·010Day 60 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·035Day 70 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·028Time to SOFA score of 0, days3·0 (1·0–8·0)8·0 (6·5–9·0)0·041Duration of hospital stay, days9·0 (7·0–13·0)14·5 (9·3–16·0)0·01630-day mortality0 (0)0 (0)1·00Time to negative viral load, daysNasopharyngeal swab7 (5–11)12 (8–15)0·0010Posterior oropharyngeal saliva6·0 (3·0–8·0)8·0 (5·3–10·8)0·044Throat swab4·5 (1·3–6·8)7·0 (3·0–12·0)0·039Stool5 (2–5)7 (4–8)0·030All specimens8 (6–12)13 (8–15)0·0010Virological findings (RT-PCR), log10 copies per mLNasopharyngeal swab (baseline)6·4 (4·5–8·0)6·4 (3·9–7·7)0·70Posterior oropharyngeal saliva (baseline)** Stress-dose steroid was hydrocortisone 50 mg every 8 h intravenously, tapered over 5–7 days.5·2 (3·8–7·0)5·3 (4·3–7·1)0·54Throat swab (baseline)4·6 (2·9–6·1)4·5 (3·7–5·7)0·85Stool (baseline)3·3 (2·7–5·3)3·8 (2·6–7·3)0·53Cytokine concentration, log10 pg/mLIL-6 (baseline)1·4 (1·0–1·4)1·4 (1·0–1·6)0·43TNFα (baseline)1 (1–1)1 (1–1)1·00Concomitant treatmentsOxygen therapy12 (14%)5 (12%)0·72Non-invasive ventilator support3 (3%)2 (5%)0·75Ventilator support01 (2%)0·15Antibiotics44 (51%)25 (61%)0·33Amoxicillin–clavulanate29 (34%)21 (51%)0·080Azithromycin7 (8%)4 (10%)0·76Ceftriaxone12 (14%)8 (20%)0·42Doxycycline13 (15%)8 (20%)0·53Levofloxacin11 (13%)3 (7%)0·36Piperacillin–tazobactam5 (6%)00·12Corticosteroid (stress dose)** Stress-dose steroid was hydrocortisone 50 mg every 8 h intravenously, tapered over 5–7 days.6 (7%)2 (5%)0·65Data are median (IQR) or n (%).

Clinical improvement was significantly better in the combination group, with a significantly shorter time to complete alleviation of symptoms, defined as a NEWS2 of 0 (4 days [IQR 3–8] in the combination group vs 8 days [7–9] in the control group; HR 3·92 [95% CI 1·66–9·23], p<0·0001) and SOFA score of 0 (3·0 days [1·0–8·0] vs 8·0 days [6·5–9·0]; HR 1·89 [1·03–3·49], p=0·041; table 2). A similar pattern was observed on the daily NEWS2 (all p<0·0001; figure 2A) and daily SOFA score after treatment (all p<0·05 except day 1 [p=0·21]; table 2). The significantly better clinical and virological response is also reflected in the shorter median hospital stay in the combination group than in the control group (9·0 days [7·0–13·0] vs 14·5 days [9·3–16·0]; HR 2·72 [1·2–6·13], p=0·016).Figure 2Outcomes over timeShow full caption(A) National early warning score 2; (B) nasopharyngeal swab viral load; (C) posterior oropharyngeal saliva viral load; (D) throat swab viral load; (E) stool viral load; and (F) serum IL-6 cytokine concentration (first 60 recruited patients).

Data points are medians and error bars are IQRs. For the virological outcome, the combination treatment was associated with significantly shorter time to negative viral load in all specimens when assessed individually (nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool samples) as well as in all specimens combined (table 2). All urine samples tested negative for viral load. All patients had a SARS-CoV-2 positive baseline nasopharyngeal swab. With regards to the other clinical samples, 108 (85%) patients provided posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples, 99 (78%) provided throat swabs, 36 (28%) provided stool samples, and 83 (65%) provided urine samples. The baseline viral loads for all specimens were similar between the combination group and control group (table 2). The nasopharyngeal swab viral load was significantly lower in the combination group than in the control group from day 1 to day 7 after treatment (figure 2B). Similar results were found in the posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool specimens after treatment (figure 2C–E). Post-hoc subgroup comparison of the 76 patients who started treatment less than 7 days after onset of symptoms showed better clinical and virological outcomes in the combination group (52 patients, receiving lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta-1b) than in the control group (24 patients; table 3) across all measured variables except stool samples. However, no significant differences between the treatment groups were measured in these outcomes in the 51 patients who were treated 7 days or more after symptom onset (34 in the combination group [receiving lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin only] and 17 in the control group; appendix p 31).Table 3Subgroup analysis of clinical, viral load, and cytokine profileStarted treatment <7 days from symptom onsetStarted treatment ≥7 days from symptom onsetCombination group (with interferon beta-1b; n=52)Control group (n=24)p valueCombination group (without interferon beta-1b; n=34)Control group (n=17)p valueNEWS2Baseline2 (1–2)2 (2–2)0·112 (1–2)2 (1–2)0·49Day 11 (1–1)2 (2–2)<0·00012 (1–2)2 (1–2)0·71Day 21·0 (0·0–1·0)2·0 (1·5–3·0)<0·00011·5 (1·0–2·0)2·0 (1·0–2·8)0·41Day 30·0 (0·0–1·0)2·0 (1·0–3·0)<0·00011·0 (1·0–2·0)2·0 (0·3–2·8)0·16Day 40·0 (0·0–0·0)2·0 (1·0–2·5)<0·00011·0 (1·0–2·0)2·0 (0·3–2·0)0·37Day 50 (0–0·5)2 (1–2)<0·00011 (0–1)2 (0–2)0·040Day 60 (0–0·3)1 (1–2)<0·00011 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·14Day 70 (0–0)1 (0–2)<0·00011 (0–1)1 (0–1)0·68Time to NEWS2 of 0, days4·0 (3·0–5·0)8·0 (6·5–9·0)<0·00016·0 (5·0–10·8)8·0 (5·5–8·0)0·90SOFA scoreBaseline0 (0–1)0 (0–1)0·991 (0–1)0 (0–1)0·17Day 10·0 (0·0–1·0)1·0 (0·0–1·0)0·0301·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–1·5)0·67Day 20 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·00601 (0–2)1 (0–2)0·72Day 30 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·00501 (0–2)1 (0–3)0·49Day 40 (0–1)1 (0–2)0·00601 (0–2)1 (0–3)0·48Day 50·0 (0·0–0·8)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·00301·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–3·0)0·55Day 60·0 (0·0–0·0)0·5 (0·0–2·0)0·00101·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·88Day 70·0 (0·0–0·0)0·5 (0·0–2·0)<0·00011·0 (0·0–2·0)1·0 (0·0–2·0)0·88Time to SOFA score of 0, days3 (1–5)7 (1–9)0·00108 (1–8)8 (1–9)0·23Duration of hospital stay, days8 (6–12·5)15 (9–16)0·003013 (8–15)13·5 (12·3–21·8)0·09030-day mortality0 (0)0 (0)1·000 (0)0 (0)1·00Time to negative viral load, daysNasopharyngeal swab6·5 (4·0–8·0)12·5 (8·0–14·8)<0·000110·5 (8·0–12·3)12·0 (8·0–17·0)0·10Posterior oropharyngeal saliva6·0 (2·0–7·0)8·5 (5·3–11·8)<0·00018·0 (6·0–9·0)8·0 (5·3–9·0)0·79Throat swab4·0 (1·0–6·0)8·0 (3·3–12·8)0·00105·0 (1·5–8·0)4·5 (2·0–9·0)0·52Stool4·5 (2·0–5·0)6·0 (3·0–7·0)0·0705·0 (2·0–10·0)7·0 (5·5–8·5)0·14All specimens7·0 (4·0–9·0)13·0 (8·0–14·0)<0·000112·0 (7·8–14·0)12·0 (12·0–19·0)0·080Virological findings (RT-PCR), log10 copies per mLNasopharyngeal swab (baseline)7 (5·2–8·4)6·1 (4·3–7·7)0·295·5 (3·8–7·3)6·6 (3·8–8)0·65Posterior oropharyngeal saliva (baseline)5·4 (3·9–7·3)5·3 (3·9–7·5)0·864·8 (3·8–6·2)5·4 (4·9–6·8)0·30Throat swab (baseline)4·8 (3·2–6·9)4·4 (3·5–6·1)0·814·5 (1·0–5·6)5·0 (4·0–5·5)0·52Stool (baseline)3·2 (1·9–6·2)3·2 (2·9–5·6)0·853·3 (2·8–3·9)5·6 (1·9–7·4)0·48Cytokine concentration, log10 pg/mLIL-6 (baseline)1·4 (1–1·5)1·4 (1·4–1·6)0·131·4 (1–1·4)1 (1–1·6)0·45TNFα (baseline)1 (1–1)1 (1–1)0·871 (1–1)1 (1–1)0·82Data are median (IQR).

NEWS2=national early warning score 2. SOFA=sequential organ failure assessment. 17 (13%) of 127 patients developed oxygen desaturation and required oxygen treatment (table 2). Six (5%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, of whom five required non-invasive ventilator support and one 96-year-old female patient with a past medical history of coronary artery disease required intubation and ventilator support. She was in the control group and was successfully extubated after 10 days of intensive care. 69 (54%) patients received concomitant antibiotics. Eight (6%) patients were given stress doses of corticosteroids in the second week from symptom onset. The serum cytokine profile was analysed in the first 84 recruited patients. The IL-6 concentration in the combination group was significantly lower than in the control group on days 2, 6, and 8 (figure 2F). TNFα concentrations and IL-10 concentrations were not significantly different between the groups. No significant nsp5 mutations were identified in serial nasopharyngeal swab samples. Multivariable analysis showed that the combination group and having a normal baseline chest x-ray were independently associated with day 7 negative nasopharyngeal swab viral load. Of the two, the combination group was the most significant independent factor (HR 4·27 [95% CI 1·82–10·02], p=0·0010; appendix p 30). Adverse events were reported by 41 (48%) of 86 patients in the combination group and 20 (49%) of 41 patients in the control group. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea (52 [41%] of 127 patients), fever (48 [38%] patients), nausea (43 [34%]) and raised alanine transaminase level (18 [14%]; table 4). These side-effects mostly resolved within 3 days after drug initiation. Sinus bradycardia was reported by four (3%) patients. There were no differences between incidence of any of the adverse events or durations of nausea or diarrhoea between the treatment groups. The peak median alanine transaminase concentration was 38·0 units per L (24·5–62·5) and peak median bilirubin was 22·0 μmol/L (17·0–32·5), in all patients. No serious adverse events were reported in the combination group. One patient in the control group had a serious adverse event of impaired hepatic enzymes requiring discontinuation of treatment. No patients died during the study.Table 4Adverse events in the study populationCombination group (n=86)Control group (n=41)p valueAdverse eventsNausea30 (35%)13 (32%)0·87Diarrhoea34 (40%)18 (44%)0·54Increased alanine aminotransferase11 (13%)7 (17%)0·32Hyperbilirubinaemia4 (5%)3 (7%)0·54Sinus bradycardia3 (4%)1 (2%)0·77Fever32 (37%)16 (39%)0·73Serious adverse events01 (2%)0·15Duration of nausea, days2 (1–2)2 (1–2)0·80Duration of diarrhoea, days3 (3–3)3 (3–3)0·88                            Open table in a new tab                         In this multicentre randomised open-label phase 2 trial in patients with COVID-19, we showed that a triple combination of an injectable interferon (interferon beta-1b), oral protease inhibitor (lopinavir–ritonavir), and an oral nucleoside analogue (ribavirin), when given within 7 days of symptom onset, is effective in suppressing the shedding of SARS-CoV-2, not just in a nasopharyngeal swab, but in all clinical specimens, compared with lopinavir–ritonavir alone. Furthermore, the significant reductions in duration of RT-PCR positivity and viral load were associated with clinical improvement as shown by the significant reduction in NEWS2 and duration of hospital stay. Most patients treated with the triple combination were RT-PCR negative in all specimens by day 8. The side-effects were generally mild and self-limiting. Specific highly active antiviral drugs are always needed for any novel emerging infectious disease because the development of a new antiviral takes years before its approval for clinical use. Therefore, drug repurposing by testing existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that have been used to treat other viral infections is the most feasible approach in a pandemic. Many drugs have been shown to have some in-vitro activity against betacoronaviruses, including remdesivir, favipiravir, nitazoxanide, camostat mesilate, interferons, lopinavir–ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and convalescent plasma containing neutralising antibodies.5Chen F Chan KH Jiang Y et al.In vitro susceptibility of 10 clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus to selected antiviral compounds.J Clin Virol. 2004; 31: 69-75Google Scholar,  6Chan JF Chan KH Kao RY et al.Broad-spectrum antivirals for the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect. 2013; 67: 606-616Google Scholar,  7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar,  8Chan JF Yao Y Yeung ML et al.Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir or interferon-β1b improves outcome of MERS-CoV infection in a nonhuman primate model of common marmoset.J Infect Dis. 2015; 212: 1904-1913Google Scholar,  13Agostini ML Andres EL Sims AC et al.Coronavirus susceptibility to the antiviral remdesivir (GS-5734) is mediated by the viral polymerase and the proofreading exoribonulcease.MBio. 2018; 9: e00221-e00318Google Scholar,  14Li G De Clercq E Therapeutic options for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020; 19: 149-150Google Scholar,  15Wang M Cao R Zhang L et al.Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 269-271Google Scholar,  16Rossignol JF Nitazoxanide, a new drug candidate for the treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect Public Health. 2016; 9: 227-230Google Scholar,  17Beigel JH Nam HH Adams PL et al.Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics - a meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference.Antiviral Res. 2019; 167: 45-67Google Scholar,  18Sheahan TP Sims AC Leist SR et al.Comparative therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir and combination lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 222Google Scholar,  19Mair-Jenkins J Saavedra-Campos M Baillie JK et al.The effectiveness of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis.J Infect Dis. 2015; 211: 80-90Google Scholar,  20Cunningham AC Goh HP Koh D Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges.Crit Care. 2020; 24: 91Google Scholar,  21Dong L Hu S Gao J Discovering drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Drug Discov Ther. 2020; 14: 58-60Google Scholar These drugs have known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, side-effects, and dosing regimens. As expected, lopinavir–ritonavir alone was shown to have similar effects to placebo on reducing viral load when treatment was initiated at a median of 13 days after symptom onset, despite some improvement in symptoms.22Cao B Wang Y Wen D et al.A trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online March 18.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2001282Google Scholar Up to now, only two open-label non-randomised trials have been reported. One trial used a combination of oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 20 patients with COVID-19 showing that this combination might reduce viral load significantly by day 6 after treatment, compared with 16 controls from another hospital, which could be due to chance because this combination was not planned a priori and the addition of azithromycin was at the physician's discretion.23Gautret P Lagier JC Parola P et al.Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020;  (published online March 20.)DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949Google Scholar A small retrospective analysis showed that viral load was negative at day 7 post-treatment in 75% of patients with COVID-19 treated with arbidol and lopinavir–ritonavir (16 patients) versus 35% of patients treated with lopinavir–ritonavir alone (17 patients).24Deng L Li C Zeng Q et al.Arbidol combined with LPV/r versus LPV/r alone against Corona Virus Disease 2019: a retrospective cohort study.J Infect. 2020;  (published March 11.)DOI:10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002Google Scholar Under the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region public health ordinance, all patients with COVID-19 must stay in hospital until nasopharyngeal swab viral loads are negative on 2 consecutive days. Thus, most patients were admitted to hospital within 7 days of symptom onset, allowing recruitment into the clinical trial during the early course of COVID-19. With the memory of the 2003 SARS pandemic, most patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong accepted antiviral treatment, which explained our high recruitment rate. Despite being an open-label study, all patients were enrolled consecutively without bias. Our case demographics and proportion of patients with underlying diseases were similar to other reported cohorts in China. The low crude mortality rate in Hong Kong (four [0·4%] of 1041 cases) could be explained by the highly vigilant infection control measures, efficient contact tracing, and early hospital admission and treatment. Early treatment with a triple combination of modestly active antivirals is appropriate for the treatment of COVID-19 because the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks at around the time of symptom onset. This is unlike the situation of SARS and MERS when the antiviral treatment has time to suppress the viral load before it peaks at around days 7–10 after symptom onset. The viral load profile of COVID-19 is similar to that of influenza, which has a high viral load at the time of initiation of anti-influenza treatment. The emergence of resistant influenza virus quasispecies during treatment has been well reported with single-drug treatment by amantadine, baloxavir marboxil, and oseltamivir in the setting of severe influenza or diseases caused by H5N1, H7N9, or in immunosuppressed hosts.11Dunning J Baillie JK Cao B Hayden FG Antiviral combinations for severe influenza.Lancet Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 1259-1270Google Scholar,  17Beigel JH Nam HH Adams PL et al.Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics - a meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference.Antiviral Res. 2019; 167: 45-67Google Scholar,  25Hayden FG Sugaya N Hirotsu N et al.Baloxavir marboxil for uncomplicated influenza in adults and adolescents.N Engl J Med. 2018; 379: 913-923Google Scholar Thus, the antiviral combination was considered a reasonable option to improve the outcome of severe influenza. Indeed, we have previously shown that a combination of naproxen and clarithromycin, with weak anti-influenza virus activity in vitro individually, when combined with oseltamivir can improve the morbidity and mortality and shorten the duration of hospital stay in patients with influenza A/H3N2 pneumonia.12Hung IFN To KKW Chan JFW et al.Efficacy of clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination in the treatment of patients hospitalized for influenza A(H3N2) infection: an open-label randomized, controlled, phase IIb/III trial.Chest. 2017; 151: 1069-1080Google Scholar Furthermore, we have previously shown that a combination of lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin significantly reduced mortality and respiratory failure in patients during the 2003 SARS outbreak.7Chu CM Cheng VC Hung IF et al.Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar Thus, we hypothesised that a triple combination of modest antiviral drugs might rapidly suppress the high initial viral load, improve the clinical parameters, and reduce risk of health-care workers by reducing the duration and quantity of virus shedding from these treated patients. An in-vitro study in cell culture-based assays showed that the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of lopinavir against SARS-CoV is about 17 μM and against MERS-CoV it is about 8 μM, whereas the peak serum lopinavir concentration is about 15 μM with a half-life of 7·4–10·8 h after an oral dose of 400 mg lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir.26de Wilde AH Jochmans D Posthuma CC et al.Screening of an FDA-approved compound library identifies four small-molecule inhibitors of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication in cell culture.Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 4875-4884Google Scholar The EC50 of interferon beta-1b is 0·12 IU/mL against SARS-CoV and 17·6 IU/mL against MERS-CoV,6Chan JF Chan KH Kao RY et al.Broad-spectrum antivirals for the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J Infect. 2013; 67: 606-616Google Scholar,  27Tan EL Ooi EE Lin CY et al.Inhibition of SARS coronavirus infection in vitro with clinically approved antiviral drugs.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 581-586Google Scholar whereas its peak serum level is about 20 IU/mL with a half-life of 2–5 h after a single subcutaneous dose of 8 million IU. Notably, the maintenance of high serum interferon beta-1b level is not essential once the antiviral status of exposed cells is induced. The EC50 of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 was 109 μM,15Wang M Cao R Zhang L et al.Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 269-271Google Scholar which greatly exceeds the drug's serum concentration with the usual oral dosing. Nevertheless, synergistic activity between interferons and a lower dose of ribavirin have been shown in checkerboard assays. However, combining ribavirin with interferons (alfa-2a, alfa-2b, and beta-1a) did not improve outcomes in critically ill patients with MERS.28Arabi YM Shalhoub S Mandourah Y et al.Ribavirin and interferon therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: a multicentre observational study.Clin Infect Dis. 2020; 70: 1837-1844Google Scholar Thus, the repurposing of this triple combination of modestly active lopinavir–ritonavir, interferon beta-1b, and ribavirin for the treatment of this novel pandemic virus should be a reasonable therapeutic approach. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in ex-vivo infected human lung tissues compared with 2003 SARS-CoV.29Chu H Chan JF-W Wang Y et al.Comparative replication and immune activation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in human lungs: an ex vivo study with implications for the pathogenesis of COVID-19.Clin Infect Dis. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1093/cid/ciaa410Google Scholar Thus, the use of interferon beta-1b treatment to jump-start or improve the antiviral response of patients would be a logical approach. Additionally, interferon beta-1b was shown to decrease virus-induced lung fibrosis in a mouse model, which might improve outcomes of patients with COVID-19 complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome.30Luckhardt TR Commes SM Trujillo G et al.TLR9-induced interferon β is associated with protection from gammaherpesvirus-induced exacerbation of lung fibrosis.Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair. 2011; 4: 18Google Scholar Despite the concern of major side-effects arising from a combination of three drugs, no significant differences in incidence of adverse events between treatment groups were reported in our cohort of 127 patients. No haemolysis occurred from the short duration of low dose ribavirin. We did not use triple combination for patients who started treatment 7 days or more after symptom onset because of the concerns about the proinflammatory side-effects of interferon beta-1b, despite that at most three doses were used for each patient. Liver dysfunction was observed in about 14% of these patients and it was mild and self-limiting, except in one patient in the control group, in whom the biochemical hepatitis warranted the discontinuation of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment. Our study had several limitations. This trial was open label, without a placebo group, and confounded by a subgroup omitting interferon beta-1b within the combination group, depending on time from symptom onset. A subsequent phase 3 trial with interferon beta-1b as a backbone treatment with a placebo control group should be considered, because subgroup comparison suggested that interferon beta-1b appears to be a key component of our combination treatment. Our absence of critically ill patients did not allow the generalisation of our findings to severe cases. Triple antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin were safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in shortening virus shedding, alleviating symptoms, and facilitating discharge of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

He was born in Rio Pardo, Brazil, on Jan 30, 1940, and died in Washington, DC, USA, on May 28, 2014, aged 74 years. The last case of polio in Latin America was detected in 1991 in the small Peruvian town of Pichanaki. 3 years later, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) declared the disease eradicated within its region. If one man can be said to deserve personal credit for this achievement, it is Ciro de Quadros. A physician trained in public health, he joined PAHO in 1977 to advise on matters related to immunisation, and to implement the Expanded Programme on Immunization in Latin America. “At that time vaccine coverage rates were only 5 to 20%”, says Donald Henderson, Professor of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh. “What Ciro did was amazing.” He persuaded countries to join what became a hemisphere-wide effort. “Within 5 or 6 years all except Haiti had well over 80% coverage.” de Quadros also created a fund for buying vaccines on behalf of PAHO members, one of the largest ever bulk purchasing schemes in the public sector. Countries were able to buy vaccines in quantities that would otherwise have been unaffordable. It was in 1985 that de Quadros put forward his programme for eliminating polio from the Americas, an ambition that Henderson admits to having viewed with scepticism. But he succeeded—and then managed something similar for indigenous measles. Henderson attributes de Quadros's success to the way he did his job. “He travelled extensively, he talked with staff, he talked with ministers. He persuaded them that it was their programme. He could help, yes—but it was their programme.” de Quadros trained at the Catholic School of Medicine in Porto Alegre, did a master's degree in public health, and in 1967 joined the Brazilian public health service working at a health centre in the Amazon region. He became involved in the smallpox campaign and, with three colleagues, began testing the value of a surveillance and containment strategy as an alternative to the proven but unaffordable policy of mass vaccination. Over the next 8 months they identified more than 100 cases of smallpox, vaccinated all their contacts, and succeeded in breaking the chain of transmission. On the strength of this achievement de Quadros became the chief epidemiologist to WHO's smallpox eradication programme in Ethiopia. “He took on smallpox in the field with something like ten Ethiopian health officers and a dozen or so US Peace Corps people”, recalls Henderson. “Ethiopia's a big place and the roads were terrible. He was working under very difficult conditions, but within 12 months they'd turned up 600 cases.” Among those Peace Corps volunteers was Peter Carrasco, now Director of the Secretariat of the International Association of Immunization Managers based at the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, DC. Two previous Peace Corps groups had dealt with all locations that were accessible by road. “When Ciro and I hooked up we were looking at the hardest parts of Ethiopia to get to”, Carrasco recalls. There was no way they could do the job on foot, so they started to use helicopters in the highlands and camels in the desert areas. It was after the success of the Ethiopian smallpox project that de Quadros joined PAHO to head up the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Between 1994 and 1998 he spent 4 years as special adviser on vaccines to the Director-General of WHO, but continued to work for PAHO until his retirement in 2002. Even then, he maintained his lifelong connection with vaccination through his appointment as a Vice-President of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington. Throughout de Quadros's life, Henderson thinks, if he was told something couldn't be done, he wanted to do it. And usually he succeeded. “His work was a marvellous illustration of community involvement in accomplishing a task”, says Henderson. “He understood management”, adds Carrasco. He used his smallpox experience in building the Expanded Programme on Immunization and ridding Latin America of polio. “He showed the doubters, and there were many of them, that polio could be eradicated. He was very practical and had very clear insights”, says Carrasco. Despite de Quadros's many awards and the medals, “he was very down to earth”, notes Carrasco. “He was the kind of man who could sit down with an ordinary health worker, have a beer with him, and motivate that guy to do a better job.” de Quadros is survived by a wife, two daughters, and two stepsons.",2020-05-22 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

The mechanisms underlying the disproportionate effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, however, remain incompletely understood.1Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062Google Scholar,  2Horton R Offline: COVID-19—bewilderment and candour.Lancet. 2020; 3951178Google Scholar SARS-CoV-2 infects the host using the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in several organs, including the lung, heart, kidney, and intestine.

Patient 1 was a male renal transplant recipient, aged 71 years, with coronary artery disease and arterial hypertension. The patient's condition deteriorated following COVID-19 diagnosis, and he required mechanical ventilation. Multisystem organ failure occurred, and the patient died on day 8. Post-mortem analysis of the transplanted kidney by electron microscopy revealed viral inclusion structures in endothelial cells (figure A, B). In histological analyses, we found an accumulation of inflammatory cells associated with endothelium, as well as apoptotic bodies, in the heart, the small bowel (figure C) and lung (figure D). An accumulation of mononuclear cells was found in the lung, and most small lung vessels appeared congested.FigurePathology of endothelial cell dysfunction in COVID-19Show full caption(A, B) Electron microscopy of kidney tissue shows viral inclusion bodies in a peritubular space and viral particles in endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary loops.

COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. Patient 2 was a woman, aged 58 years, with diabetes, arterial hypertension, and obesity. She developed progressive respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and subsequently developed multi-organ failure and needed renal replacement therapy. On day 16, mesenteric ischaemia prompted removal of necrotic small intestine. Circulatory failure occurred in the setting of right heart failure consequent to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest resulted in death. Post-mortem histology revealed lymphocytic endotheliitis in lung, heart, kidney, and liver as well as liver cell necrosis. We found histological evidence of myocardial infarction but no sign of lymphocytic myocarditis. Histology of the small intestine showed endotheliitis (endothelialitis) of the submucosal vessels. Patient 3 was a man, aged 69 years, with hypertension who developed respiratory failure as a result of COVID-19 and required mechanical ventilation. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Circulatory collapse ensued with mesenteric ischaemia, and small intestine resection was performed, but the patient survived. Histology of the small intestine resection revealed prominent endotheliitis of the submucosal vessels and apoptotic bodies (figure C). We found evidence of direct viral infection of the endothelial cell and diffuse endothelial inflammation. Although the virus uses ACE2 receptor expressed by pneumocytes in the epithelial alveolar lining to infect the host, thereby causing lung injury, the ACE2 receptor is also widely expressed on endothelial cells, which traverse multiple organs.3Ferrario CM Jessup J Chappell MC et al.Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockers on cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.Circulation. 2005; 111: 2605-2610Google Scholar Recruitment of immune cells, either by direct viral infection of the endothelium or immune-mediated, can result in widespread endothelial dysfunction associated with apoptosis (figure D). The vascular endothelium is an active paracrine, endocrine, and autocrine organ that is indispensable for the regulation of vascular tone and the maintenance of vascular homoeostasis.5Flammer AJ Anderson T Celermajer DS et al.The assessment of endothelial function: from research into clinical practice.Circulation. 2012; 126: 753-767Google Scholar Endothelial dysfunction is a principal determinant of microvascular dysfunction by shifting the vascular equilibrium towards more vasoconstriction with subsequent organ ischaemia, inflammation with associated tissue oedema, and a pro-coagulant state.6Bonetti PO Lerman LO Lerman A Endothelial dysfunction - a marker of atherosclerotic risk.Arterioscl Throm Vas. 2003; 23: 168-175Google Scholar Our findings show the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and an accumulation of inflammatory cells, with evidence of endothelial and inflammatory cell death. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates the induction of endotheliitis in several organs as a direct consequence of viral involvement (as noted with presence of viral bodies) and of the host inflammatory response. In addition, induction of apoptosis and pyroptosis might have an important role in endothelial cell injury in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-endotheliitis could explain the systemic impaired microcirculatory function in different vascular beds and their clinical sequelae in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis provides a rationale for therapies to stabilise the endothelium while tackling viral replication, particularly with anti-inflammatory anti-cytokine drugs, ACE inhibitors, and statins.7Anderson TJ Meredith IT Yeung AC Frei B Selwyn AP Ganz P The effect of cholesterol-lowering and antioxidant therapy on endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion.N Engl J Med. 1995; 332: 488-493Google Scholar,  8Taddei S Virdis A Ghiadoni L Mattei P Salvetti A Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in essential hypertensive patients.J Hypertens. 1998; 16: 447-456Google Scholar,  9Flammer AJ Sudano I Hermann F et al.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves vascular function in rheumatoid arthritis.Circulation. 2008; 117: 2262-2269Google Scholar,  10Hurlimann D Forster A Noll G et al.Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment improves endothelial function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Circulation. 2002; 106: 2184-2187Google Scholar,  11Feldmann M Maini RN Woody JN et al.Trials of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy for COVID-19 are urgently needed.Lancet. 2020;  (published online April 9.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30858-8SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFGoogle Scholar This strategy could be particularly relevant for vulnerable patients with pre-existing endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and established cardiovascular disease, all of which are associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19.

Sophie Cousins reports. New Zealand recorded its first day of no new cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early this week, more than a month after its strict lockdown began. At the time of publication, New Zealand had recorded fewer than 1500 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 20 deaths. On March 23, a month after the country had recorded its first case, New Zealand committed to an elimination strategy. A few days later, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a strict national lockdown when it only had 102 cases and zero deaths. Her swift decision making won international praise, including from WHO. New Zealand's decision to pursue an elimination approach was a vastly different approach to usual pandemic planning, which has historically been based on a mitigation model and focuses on delaying the arrival of the virus, followed by a range of measures to flatten the curve of cases and deaths. Michael Baker, professor at the University of Otago's department of public health in Wellington, who has been advising the New Zealand Government on its response, said implementing a full lockdown—involving the closure of schools and non-essential workplaces, a ban on social gatherings, and severe travel restrictions—enabled the country to consider elimination. “I think it was the right decision; we had to go hard”, he said. “The two biggest benefits of pursuing an elimination strategy is that you have few cases and few deaths and you can get business back up and running. The alternative was that we are stuck with the virus and stuck between mitigation and suppression. Suppression is pretty grim.” While the strategy has had its critics, for Baker, the evidence was overwhelming that elimination could be achieved. Baker said the full lockdown allowed the country to get key systems up and running to effectively manage borders, and do contact tracing, testing, and surveillance. Since Jan 22, more than 150 000 people have been tested in a country of just 5 million. Testing has been focused on people with symptoms, with tracing of both close contacts and casual contacts. However, more widespread testing is now being introduced. The Ministry of Health is in discussion with districts to arrange testing of specific communities who are at higher risk of acquiring the virus such as those in aged residential care and health-care workers. Testing samples from sewerage is also being considered to monitor control and elimination. The response has also been one that placed science, leadership, and careful language at the forefront. Siouxsie Wiles, associate professor and head of the Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab at the University of Auckland, said one of the country's key successes has been the way in which COVID-19 was framed to the general population. “In other countries, people have been talking about war and battle, which puts people in a negative and fearful frame of mind”, she said. “The official response here has been guided by the principle that you do not stigmatise and that we unite against COVID-19.” Ardern has regularly appeared on social media, smiling and sharing parts of her personal life under lockdown but without underplaying the seriousness of the situation, which has helped to build public trust. Baker agreed that language was a crucial part of the response. He said that how the country communicates the concept of elimination will be important going forwards. Wiles agreed. “We don't want the public to feel like they are being lied to. Elimination to everyone means that it is gone. But in epidemiological terms, it means bringing cases down to zero or near zero in a geographical location. We will still see cases…but only cases in people who have arrived from overseas.” Travellers from abroad will be quarantined as part of efforts to prevent transmission in New Zealand. As New Zealand now eases its restrictions and its economy slowly reopens, there are discussions about how it can open up its borders while ensuring that everyone is protected, particularly susceptible populations. Australia, which is having similar success to New Zealand but is not publicly floating the idea of elimination, has been in discussion with its neighbour about reopening travel between the two countries. Baker envisions that, in time, a small number of countries in the region will reach an agreement to enable travel with specific control measures in place. Officials have pleaded for vigilance as breaches of the shutdown rules continue to rise. When the country loosened some of its restrictions last week, some fast-food outlets ran out of food as people flocked in huge numbers to get burgers and fries. “We are nearly there. We are not at the finish line yet”, Wiles said. “We won't see how successful we have been for a few weeks yet.”",2020-05-22 00:00:00,LANCET,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

Clinical presentations were similar, with unrelenting fever (38–40°C), variable rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral oedema, and generalised extremity pain with significant gastrointestinal symptoms. All progressed to warm, vasoplegic shock, refractory to volume resuscitation and eventually requiring noradrenaline and milrinone for haemodynamic support. Most of the children had no significant respiratory involvement, although seven of the children required mechanical ventilation for cardiovascular stabilisation. Other notable features (besides persistent fever and rash) included development of small pleural, pericardial, and ascitic effusions, suggestive of a diffuse inflammatory process. All children tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on broncho-alveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal aspirates. Despite being critically unwell, with laboratory evidence of infection or inflammation3Li Y Zou L Wu J et al.Kawasaki disease shock syndrome: clinical characteristics and possible use of IL-6, IL-10 and IFN- as biomarkers for early recognition.Pediatr Rheumatol Online J. 2019; 17: 1CrossrefPubMedScopus (2)Google Scholar including elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, triglycerides, and D-dimers, no pathological organism was identified in seven of the children. Adenovirus and enterovirus were isolated in one child. Baseline electrocardiograms were non-specific; however, a common echocardiographic finding was echo-bright coronary vessels (appendix), which progressed to giant coronary aneurysm in one patient within a week of discharge from paediatric intensive care (appendix). One child developed arrhythmia with refractory shock, requiring extracorporeal life support, and died from a large cerebrovascular infarct. The myocardial involvement2Liu P Blet A Smyth D Li H The science underlying COVID-19: implications for the cardiovascular system.Circulation. 2020;  (published online April 15.)DOI:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047549CrossrefGoogle Scholar in this syndrome is evidenced by very elevated cardiac enzymes during the course of illness. All children were given intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) in the first 24 h, and antibiotic cover including ceftriaxone and clindamycin. Subsequently, six children have been given 50 mg/kg aspirin. All of the children were discharged from PICU after 4–6 days. Since discharge, two of the children have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (including the child who died, in whom SARS-CoV-2 was detected post mortem). All children are receiving ongoing surveillance for coronary abnormalities. We suggest that this clinical picture represents a new phenomenon affecting previously asymptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection manifesting as a hyperinflammatory syndrome with multiorgan involvement similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome. The multifaceted nature of the disease course underlines the need for multispecialty input (intensive care, cardiology, infectious diseases, immunology, and rheumatology). The intention of this Correspondence is to bring this subset of children to the attention of the wider paediatric community and to optimise early recognition and management. As this Correspondence goes to press, 1 week after the initial submission, the Evelina London Children's Hospital paediatric intensive care unit has managed more than 20 children with similar clinical presentation, the first ten of whom tested positive for antibody (including the original eight children in the cohort described above).

Severe critics have described it as Sweden sacrificing its (elderly) citizens to quickly reach herd immunity.1Henley J Swedish PM warned over ‘Russian roulette-style’ Covid-19 strategy.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/swedish-pm-warned-russian-roulette-covid-19-strategy-herd-immunityDate: March 23, 2020Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar The death toll has surpassed our three closest neighbours, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, but the mortality remains lower than in the UK, Spain, and Belgium.2European Centre for Disease Prevention and Controlhttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-casesDate: May 1, 2020Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar It has become clear that a hard lockdown does not protect old and frail people living in care homes—a population the lockdown was designed to protect.3BBCCoronavirus: Hard to prevent care home deaths, says Chris Whitty.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52386808Date: April 22, 2020Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar Neither does it decrease mortality from COVID-19, which is evident when comparing the UK's experience with that of other European countries. PCR testing and some straightforward assumptions indicate that, as of April 29, 2020, more than half a million people in Stockholm county, Sweden, which is about 20–25% of the population, have been infected (Hansson D, Swedish Public Health Agency, personal communication). 98–99% of these people are probably unaware or uncertain of having had the infection; they either had symptoms that were severe, but not severe enough for them to go to a hospital and get tested, or no symptoms at all. Serology testing is now supporting these assumptions.4Hedberg K Var femte anställd på Danderyds sjukhus har haft smittan.https://www.dn.se/sthlm/var-femte-anstalld-pa-danderyds-sjukhus-har-haft-smittan/Date: April 27, 2020Date accessed: May 1, 2020Google Scholar These facts have led me to the following conclusions. Everyone will be exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and most people will become infected. COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire in all countries, but we do not see it—it almost always spreads from younger people with no or weak symptoms to other people who will also have mild symptoms. This is the real pandemic, but it goes on beneath the surface, and is probably at its peak now in many European countries. There is very little we can do to prevent this spread: a lockdown might delay severe cases for a while, but once restrictions are eased, cases will reappear. I expect that when we count the number of deaths from COVID-19 in each country in 1 year from now, the figures will be similar, regardless of measures taken. Measures to flatten the curve might have an effect, but a lockdown only pushes the severe cases into the future —it will not prevent them. Admittedly, countries have managed to slow down spread so as not to overburden health-care systems, and, yes, effective drugs that save lives might soon be developed, but this pandemic is swift, and those drugs have to be developed, tested, and marketed quickly. Much hope is put in vaccines, but they will take time, and with the unclear protective immunological response to infection, it is not certain that vaccines will be very effective. In summary, COVID-19 is a disease that is highly infectious and spreads rapidly through society. It is often quite symptomless and might pass unnoticed, but it also causes severe disease, and even death, in a proportion of the population, and our most important task is not to stop spread, which is all but futile, but to concentrate on giving the unfortunate victims optimal care.

Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.

Quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease to ascertain if they become unwell, so reducing the risk of them infecting others.1Centers for Disease Control and PreventionQuarantine and isolation.https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.htmlDate: 2017Google Scholar This definition differs from isolation, which is the separation of people who have been diagnosed with a contagious disease from people who are not sick; however, the two terms are often used interchangeably, especially in communication with the public.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar The word quarantine was first used in Venice, Italy in 1127 with regards to leprosy and was widely used in response to the Black Death, although it was not until 300 years later that the UK properly began to impose quarantine in response to plague.3Newman K Shutt up: bubonic plague and quarantine in early modern England.J Sol Hist. 2012; 45: 809-834CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Most recently, quarantine has been used in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This outbreak has seen entire cities in China effectively placed under mass quarantine, while many thousands of foreign nationals returning home from China have been asked to self-isolate at home or in state-run facilities.4Public Health EnglandNovel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – what you need to know.https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2020/01/23/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-what-you-need-to-know/Date: 2020Google Scholar There are precedents for such measures. Citywide quarantines were also imposed in areas of China and Canada during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whereas entire villages in many west African countries were quarantined during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

Two studies reported on longer-term effects of quarantine. 3 years after the SARS outbreak, alcohol abuse or dependency symptoms were positively associated with having been quarantined in health-care workers.32Wu P Liu X Fang Y et al.Alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms among hospital employees exposed to a SARS outbreak.Alcohol Alcohol. 2008; 43: 706-712CrossrefPubMedScopus (9)Google Scholar In a multivariate analysis,32Wu P Liu X Fang Y et al.Alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms among hospital employees exposed to a SARS outbreak.Alcohol Alcohol. 2008; 43: 706-712CrossrefPubMedScopus (9)Google Scholar after controlling for demographic factors, having been quarantined and having worked in a high-risk location were the two types of exposure significantly associated with these outcomes (for quarantine: unadjusted mean ratio 0·45; 95% CI 1·02–2·65). After quarantine, many participants continued to engage in avoidance behaviours. For health-care workers,20Marjanovic Z Greenglass ER Coffey S The relevance of psychosocial variables and working conditions in predicting nurses' coping strategies during the SARS crisis: an online questionnaire survey.Int J Nurs Stud. 2007; 44: 991-998CrossrefPubMedScopus (17)Google Scholar being quarantined was significantly and positively associated with avoidance behaviours, such as minimising direct contact with patients and not reporting to work.

There was mixed evidence for whether participant characteristics and demographics were predictors of the psychological impact of quarantine. A study28Taylor MR Agho KE Stevens GJ Raphael B Factors influencing psychological distress during a disease epidemic: data from Australia's first outbreak of equine influenza.BMC Public Health. 2008; 8: 347CrossrefPubMedScopus (27)Google Scholar of horse owners quarantined because of equine influenza identified several characteristics associated with negative psychological impacts: younger age (16–24 years), lower levels of formal educational qualifications, female gender, and having one child as opposed to no children (although having three or more children appeared somewhat protective). However, another study16Hawryluck L Gold WL Robinson S Pogorski S Galea S Styra R SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 1206-1212CrossrefPubMedScopus (93)Google Scholar suggested that demographic factors such as marital status, age, education, living with other adults, and having children were not associated with psychological outcomes. Having a history of psychiatric illness was associated with experiencing anxiety and anger 4–6 months after release from quarantine.17Jeong H Yim HW Song Y-J et al.Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East respiratory syndrome.Epidemiol Health. 2016; 38: e2016048CrossrefPubMedScopus (12)Google Scholar Health-care workers25Reynolds DL Garay JR Deamond SL Moran MK Gold W Styra R Understanding, compliance and psychological impact of the SARS quarantine experience.Epidemiol Infect. 2008; 136: 997-1007CrossrefPubMedScopus (18)Google Scholar who had been quarantined had more severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress than members of the general public who had been quarantined, scoring significantly higher on all dimensions. Health-care workers also felt greater stigmatisation than the general public, exhibited more avoidance behaviours after quarantine, reported greater lost income, and were consistently more affected psychologically: they reported substantially more anger, annoyance, fear, frustration, guilt, helplessness, isolation, loneliness, nervousness, sadness, worry, and were less happy. Health-care workers were also substantially more likely to think they had SARS and to be concerned about infecting others.

This finding is probably linked to economic effects but could also be related to disruption of social networks and loss of leisure activities. Notably, this study is exceptional in that occupation and exposure are confounded. A study14Desclaux A Badji D Ndione AG Sow K Accepted monitoring or endured quarantine? Ebola contacts' perceptions in Senegal.Soc Sci Med. 2017; 178: 38-45CrossrefPubMedScopus (5)Google Scholar of people quarantined because of potential Ebola contact found that, although participants received financial assistance, some felt that the amount was insufficient and that it came too late; many felt wronged as the assistance they received did not cover their ongoing professional expenses. Many became dependent on their families to provide for them financially during quarantine which was often hard to accept and could cause conflicts. In one study,13Cava MA Fay KE Beanlands HJ McCay EA Wignall R The experience of quarantine for individuals affected by SARS in Toronto.Public Health Nurs. 2005; 22: 398-406CrossrefPubMedScopus (18)Google Scholar none of those quarantined in Toronto during SARS reported much financial hardship because employers or the government compensated them, but where that reimbursement was slow to arrive it caused those less financially well-off to struggle. Potentially related to financial loss, participants with a combined annual household income of less than CAN$40 000 showed significantly higher amounts of post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms.16Hawryluck L Gold WL Robinson S Pogorski S Galea S Styra R SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 1206-1212CrossrefPubMedScopus (93)Google Scholar These symptoms are probably because those with lower incomes were more likely to be affected by the temporary loss of income than those with higher incomes. People who are quarantined and have lower household incomes might require additional levels of support, along with those who lose earnings while in quarantine (ie, self-employed people who are unable to work or salaried staff who are unable to take paid leave). Financial reimbursements should be provided where possible and programmes developed to provide financial support throughout the quarantine period. Where appropriate, employers might also wish to consider proactive approaches that allow employees to work from home if they wish to, both to avoid financial loss and to stave off boredom, while being mindful that staff in these situations might not be at their most productive and might benefit more from remote social support from their colleagues.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Stigma from others was a major theme throughout the literature, often continuing for some time after quarantine, even after containment of the outbreak.

Those quarantined during the Ebola epidemic in Liberia reported that stigma could lead to disenfranchisement of minority groups in the community as families under quarantine were often said to belong to different ethnic groups, tribes, or religions and were perceived as dangerous because they were different.24Pellecchia U Crestani R Decroo T Van den Bergh R Al-Kourdi Y Social consequences of Ebola containment measures in Liberia.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0143036CrossrefPubMedScopus (23)Google Scholar Perhaps because of this stigma, being quarantined led participants in this study to keep easily treatable, non-Ebola illnesses a secret and avoided seeking help. General education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can be beneficial to reduce stigmatisation, whereas more detailed information targeted at schools and workplaces might also be useful. It might also be that media reporting contributes to stigmatising attitudes in the general public; the media is a powerful influence on public attitudes and dramatic headlines and fear mongering have been shown to contribute to stigmatising attitudes in the past (eg, during the SARS outbreak).36Person B Sy F Holton K et al.Fear and stigma: the epidemic within the SARS outbreak.Emerg Infect Dis. 2004; 10: 358-363CrossrefPubMedScopus (70)Google Scholar This issue highlights the need for public health officials to provide rapid, clear messages delivered effectively for the entire affected population to promote accurate understanding of the situation. During major infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be a necessary preventive measure. However, this Review suggests that quarantine is often associated with a negative psychological effect. During the period of quarantine this negative psychological effect is unsurprising, yet the evidence that a psychological effect of quarantine can still be detected months or years later—albeit from a small number of studies17Jeong H Yim HW Song Y-J et al.Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East respiratory syndrome.Epidemiol Health. 2016; 38: e2016048CrossrefPubMedScopus (12)Google Scholar,  19Liu X Kakade M Fuller CJ et al.Depression after exposure to stressful events: lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic.Compr Psychiatry. 2012; 53: 15-23CrossrefPubMedScopus (6)Google Scholar— is more troubling and suggests the need to ensure that effective mitigation measures are put in place as part of the quarantine planning process. In this regard, our results do not provide strong evidence that any particular demographic factors are risk factors of poor psychological outcomes after quarantine and therefore require specific attention. However, history of mental illness was only examined as a risk factor by one study. Previous literature suggests that psychiatric history is associated with psychological distress after experiencing any disaster-related trauma37Alvarez J Hunt M Risk and resilience in canine search and rescue handlers after 9/11.J Trauma Stress. 2005; 18: 497-505CrossrefPubMedScopus (40)Google Scholar,  38Cukor J Wyka K Jayasinghe N et al.Prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms in utility workers deployed to the World Trade Center following the attacks of September 11, 2001.Depress Anxiety. 2011; 28: 210-217CrossrefPubMedScopus (34)Google Scholar and it is likely that people with pre-existing poor mental health would need extra support during quarantine. There also appeared to be a high prevalence of psychological distress in quarantined health-care workers, although there was mixed evidence as to whether this group were at higher risk for distress than non-health-care workers who were quarantined. For health-care workers, support from managers is essential in facilitating their return to work39Brooks SK Dunn R Amlôt R Rubin GJ Greenberg N A systematic, thematic review of social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in healthcare employees during an infectious disease outbreak.J Occup Environ Med. 2018; 60: 248-257CrossrefPubMedScopus (3)Google Scholar and managers should be aware of the potential risks for their staff who were quarantined so that they can prepare for early intervention. Longer quarantine is associated with poorer psychological outcomes, perhaps unsurprisingly, as it stands to reason that the stressors reported by participants could have more of an effect the longer they were experienced for. Restricting the length of quarantine to what is scientifically reasonable given the known duration of incubation periods, and not adopting an overly precautionary approach to this, would minimise the effect on people. Evidence from elsewhere also emphasises the importance of authorities adhering to their own recommended length of quarantine, and not extending it. For people already in quarantine, an extension, no matter how small, is likely to exacerbate any sense of frustration or demoralisation.40Rona RJ Fear NT Hull L et al.Mental health consequences of overstretch in the UK armed forces: first phase of a cohort study.BMJ. 2007; 335: 603CrossrefPubMedScopus (100)Google Scholar Imposing a cordon indefinitely on whole cities with no clear time limit (such as has been seen in Wuhan, China) might be more detrimental than strictly applied quarantine procedures limited to the period of incubation. People who are quarantined often feared being infected or infecting others. They also often have catastrophic appraisals of any physical symptoms experienced during the quarantine period. This fear is a common occurrence for people exposed to a worrying infectious disease,41Rubin GJ Harper S Williams PD et al.How to support staff deploying on overseas humanitarian work: a qualitative analysis of responder views about the 2014/15 West African Ebola outbreak.Eur J Psychotraumatol. 2016; 7: 30933CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar and might be exacerbated by the often inadequate information participants reported receiving from public health officials leaving them unclear of the nature of the risks they faced and why they were being quarantined at all. Ensuring that those under quarantine have a good understanding of the disease in question, and the reasons for quarantine, should be a priority. Officials also need to ensure that quarantined households have enough supplies for their basic needs and, importantly, these must be provided as rapidly as possible. Coordination for provision of supplies should ideally occur in advance, with conservation and reallocation plans established to ensure resources do not run out, which unfortunately has been reported.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Boredom and isolation will cause distress; people who are quarantined should be advised about what they can do to stave off boredom and provided with practical advice on coping and stress management techniques. Having a working mobile phone is now a necessity, not a luxury, and those stepping off a long flight to enter quarantine will probably welcome a charger or adaptor more than anything else.17Jeong H Yim HW Song Y-J et al.Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East respiratory syndrome.Epidemiol Health. 2016; 38: e2016048CrossrefPubMedScopus (12)Google Scholar Activating your social network, albeit remotely, is not just a key priority, but an inability to do so is associated not just with immediate anxiety, but longer- term distress.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar,  42Rubin GJ Brewin CR Greenberg N Simpson J Wessely S Psychological and behavioural reactions to the bombings in London on 7 July 2005: cross sectional survey of a representative sample of Londoners.BMJ. 2005; 331: 606CrossrefPubMedScopus (154)Google Scholar One study21Maunder R Hunter J Vincent L et al.The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital.CMAJ. 2003; 168: 1245-1251PubMedGoogle Scholar suggested that having a telephone support line, staffed by psychiatric nurses, set up specifically for those in quarantine could be effective in terms of providing them with a social network. The ability to communicate with one's family and friends is also essential. Particularly, social media could play an important part in communication with those far away, allowing people who are quarantined to update their loved ones about their situation and reassure them that they are well. Therefore, providing those quarantined with mobile phones, cords and outlets for charging devices, and robust WiFi networks with internet access to allow them to communicate directly with loved ones could reduce feelings of isolation, stress, and panic.2Manuell M-E Cukor J Mother Nature versus human nature: public compliance with evacuation and quarantine.Disasters. 2011; 35: 417-442CrossrefPubMedScopus (8)Google Scholar Although this is possible to achieve in enforced quarantine, it could be more difficult to do in the case of widespread home quarantine; countries imposing censors on social media and messaging applications could also present difficulties in ensuring lines of communication between those quarantined and their loved ones. It is also important that public health officials maintain clear lines of communication with people quarantined about what to do if they experience any symptoms. A phone line or online service specifically set up for those in quarantine and staffed by health-care workers who can provide instructions about what to do in the event of developing illness symptoms, would help reassure people that they will be cared for if they become ill. This service would show those who are quarantined that they have not been forgotten and that their health needs are just as important as those of the wider public. The benefits of such a resource have not been studied, but it is likely that reassurance could subsequently decrease feelings such as fear, worry, and anger. There is evidence to suggest that support groups specifically for people who were quarantined at home during disease outbreaks can be helpful. One study23Pan PJD Chang S-H Yu Y-Y A support group for home-quarantined college students exposed to SARS: learning from practice.J Spec Group Work. 2005; 30: 363-374CrossrefScopus (4)Google Scholar found that having such a group and feeling connected to others who had been through the same situation could be a validating, empowering experience and can provide people with the support they might find they are not receiving from other people. Health-care workers themselves are often quarantined and this Review suggests they, like the general public, are negatively affected by stigmatising attitudes from others. None of the studies included in this Review focused on the perceptions of their colleagues, but this would be an interesting aspect to explore. It is also possible that health-care workers who are quarantined might be concerned about causing their workplaces to be understaffed and causing extra work for their colleagues21Maunder R Hunter J Vincent L et al.The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital.CMAJ. 2003; 168: 1245-1251PubMedGoogle Scholar and that their colleagues' perceptions could be particularly important. Being separated from a team they are used to working in close contact with might add to feelings of isolation for health-care workers who are quarantined. Therefore, it is essential that they feel supported by their immediate colleagues. During infectious disease outbreaks, organisational support has been found to be protective of mental health for health-care staff in general39Brooks SK Dunn R Amlôt R Rubin GJ Greenberg N A systematic, thematic review of social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in healthcare employees during an infectious disease outbreak.J Occup Environ Med. 2018; 60: 248-257CrossrefPubMedScopus (3)Google Scholar and managers should take steps to ensure their staff members are supportive of their colleagues who are quarantined. Perhaps because of the difficulties of designing an appropriate study, no research was found which tested whether mandatory versus voluntary quarantine has a differential effect on wellbeing. In other contexts, however, feeling that others will benefit from one's situation can make stressful situations easier to bear and it seems likely that this is also true for home-based quarantine. Reinforcing that quarantine is helping to keep others safe, including those particularly vulnerable (such as those who are very young, old, or with pre-existing serious medical conditions), and that health authorities are genuinely grateful to them, can only help to reduce the mental health effect and adherence in those quarantined.19Liu X Kakade M Fuller CJ et al.Depression after exposure to stressful events: lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic.Compr Psychiatry. 2012; 53: 15-23CrossrefPubMedScopus (6)Google Scholar,  33Wu P Fang Y Guan Z et al.The psychological impact of the SARS epidemic on hospital employees in China: exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk.Can J Psychiatry. 2009; 54: 302-311CrossrefPubMedScopus (33)Google Scholar Notably, altruism has its limits if people are being asked to quarantine without adequate information on how to keep the people they live with safe. It is unacceptable to ask people to self-quarantine for the benefit of the community's health, when while doing so they might be putting their loved ones at risk. Quarantine is one of several public health measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and as shown in this Review, has a considerable psychological impact for those affected. As such, there is a question as to whether other public health measures that prevent the need to impose quarantine (such as social distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, and school closures) might be more favourable. Future research is needed to establish the effectiveness of such measures. The strengths and limitations of this Review must be considered. Because of the time constraints of this Review given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the reviewed literature did not undergo formal quality appraisal. Additionally, the Review was limited to peer-reviewed publications and we did not explore potentially relevant grey literature. The recommendations we have made apply primarily to small groups of people in dedicated facilities and to some extent in self-isolation. Although we anticipate that many of the risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes would be the same for larger containment processes (such as entire towns or cities), there are likely to be distinct differences in such situations that mean that the information presented in this Review should only be applied to such situations cautiously. Furthermore, potential cultural differences need to be considered. Although this Review cannot predict exactly what will happen or provide recommendations that will work for every future population that is quarantined, we have provided an overview of the key issues and how they could be rectified in the future. There are also several limitations of the reviewed literature, which must be pointed out: only one study followed up participants over time, sample sizes were generally small, few studies directly compared participants quarantined with those not quarantined, conclusions based on certain study populations (eg, students) might not be generalisable to the wider public, and heterogeneity of outcome measures across studies make it difficult to make direct comparisons between studies. It is also worth pointing out that a minority of studies assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress using measures designed to measure post-traumatic stress disorder, despite quarantine not being qualified as a trauma in the diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5.43American Psychiatric AssociationDiagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5.  American Psychiatric Association,        Arlington, VA2013CrossrefGoogle Scholar Strengths of this Review include the hand-searching of reference lists to identify any papers not found in the initial search, contacting authors who sent full-texts of papers which were not available in full online, and having multiple researchers carry out the screening to improve the rigour of the Review. Overall, this Review suggests that the psychological impact of quarantine is wide-ranging, substantial, and can be long lasting. This is not to suggest that quarantine should not be used; the psychological effects of not using quarantine and allowing disease to spread might be worse.44Hull HF SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada.Emerging Infectious Diseases. 2005; 11: 354-355CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar However, depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled carefully. If quarantine is essential, then our results suggest that officials should take every measure to ensure that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people. This can be achieved by: telling people what is happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling. Health officials charged with implementing quarantine, who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security, should also remember that not everyone is in the same situation. If the quarantine experience is negative, the results of this Review suggest there can be long-term consequences that affect not just the people quarantined but also the health-care system that administered the quarantine and the politicians and public health officials who mandated it. Our search strategy was designed to inform this Review and a second review to be published elsewhere relating to adherence to quarantine. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The full list of search terms can be found in the appendix. In brief, we used a combination of terms relating to quarantine (eg, “quarantine” and “patient isolation”) and psychological outcomes (eg, “psych” and “stigma”). For studies to be included in this Review, they had to report on primary research, be published in peer-reviewed journals, be written in English or Italian (as these are the languages spoken by the current authors), include participants asked to enter into quarantine outside of a hospital environment for at least 24 hours, and include data on the prevalence of mental illness or psychological wellbeing, or on factors associated with mental illness or psychological wellbeing (ie, any predictors of psychological wellbeing during or after quarantine). The initial search yielded 3166 papers, of which 24 included relevant data and were included in this Review. The screening process is illustrated in the figure.

We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain.MethodsWe did a dose-escalation, single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups (5 × 1010, 1 × 1011, and 1·5 × 1011 viral particles) to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine. The primary outcome was adverse events in the 7 days post-vaccination. Safety was assessed over 28 days post-vaccination. Specific antibodies were measured with ELISA, and the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in January, 2020.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on May 8, 2020, for clinical trial reports with the terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, and “clinical trial” and no date or language restrictions; no other data from a human clinical trial of COVID-19 vaccine have been reported thus far, to our knowledge. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for unpublished trials of COVID-19 vaccines, up to May 6, 2020. In addition to the adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine reported here, seven candidate COVID-19 vaccines are in ongoing clinical trials, including Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Inovio Pharmaceuticals' DNA vaccine, Sinovac, Wuhan and Beijing Institute of Biological Products' inactive COVID-19 vaccines, University of Oxford's chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, and BioNTech's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.Added value of this studyThis first-in-human trial showed that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerable and immunogenic in healthy adults. One dose of the vaccine at all dose concentrations (5 × 1010, 1 × 1011, and 1·5 × 1011 viral particles) tested induced both specific antibody and T-cell responses in most participants. Rapid specific T-cell responses were noted at day 14 and specific humoral responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination. Although we found that the high dose vaccine tended to be more immunogenic than the middle dose and low dose vaccines, it was also associated with a higher reactogenicity. Severe fever, fatigue, dyspnoea, muscle pain, and joint pain were reported in some of the recipients in the high dose group.Implications of all the available evidenceMany vaccine candidates are in rapid development, including recombinant-protein based vaccines, replicating or non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines (which mostly have focused on the spike glycoprotein or receptor binding domain), live attenuated vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines. All of these vaccine platforms have advantages and disadvantages, and it is too soon to predict which will be more successful. Our study suggests that there is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.

Our study suggests that there is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19. Here, we report the preliminary assessment at 28 days post-vaccination of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CanSino's non-replicating Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults in China. We did a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, dose-escalation phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate in a rehabilitation centre in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Eligible participants were healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years, who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by negative results of serum specific IgM and IgG antibodies with a commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid test kit (Jinwofu, Beijing, China), negative nucleic acid for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs or sputum and anal swabs detected with a nucleic acid diagnostic kit (PCR-fluorescence probing, Sansure Biotech, Changsha, China), and a clear chest CT image with no evidence of lesions in the lungs at the time of screening. Exclusion criteria were a history of seizures or mental illness; allergy to any ingredient included in the vaccine; acute febrile disease on the day of enrolment; receipt of any blood products in the past 4 months; receipt of any research medicines or vaccine in the past month; and being unable to comply with the study schedule. Further details are outlined in the protocol.10Zhu F-C Guan X-H Wang W et al.Protocol. A single-center, open-label, dose-escalating phase I clinical trial of the recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine (adenovirus type 5 vector) in healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years in China.http://www.jscdc.cn/jkfw/kygz/202005/P020200517367817987697.pdfDate: 2020Date accessed: May 20, 2020Google Scholar Participants were sequentially enrolled to receive a single intramuscular injection in a dose-escalating manner: the first group of participants were allocated to receive the low dose, followed up for a minimum of 3 days before proceeding to recruit further participants to receive the middle dose, and then after safety observation for 3 days, the last group of participants were recruited and allocated to receive the high dose. The administration of higher dose injections and new enrolment were paused if any criteria for pausing dose escalation were met. The protocol and informed consent were approved by the institutional review board of the Jiangsu Provincial Center of Disease Control and Prevention. Written informed consent from all participants was obtained before screening. This study was undertaken by Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was developed by Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Beijing, China) and CanSino Biologics (Tianjin, China). The vaccine is a replication defective Ad5 vectored vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. We cloned an optimised full-length spike gene based on Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number YP_009724390) with the tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide gene into an E1 and E3 deleted Ad5 vector, and constructed the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine using the Admax system from Microbix Biosystem (Toronto, ON, Canada). The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was manufactured as a liquid formulation containing 5 × 1010 viral particles per 0·5 mL in a vial. A single shot was allocated intramuscularly in the arm of the participants in the low dose group, with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (5 × 1010 viral particles per 0·5 mL). The participants in the middle dose group received one shot intramuscularly in the arm with two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (1 × 1011 viral particles per mL). Participants in the high dose group received a double-shot regimen with one vial of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in one arm and two vials of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in the other arm (1·5 × 1011 viral particles per 1·5 mL). Adverse events were self-reported by the participants, but verified by investigators daily during the first 14 days after vaccination. Subsequently, adverse events were recorded by the participants on diary cards in the following weeks. Laboratory safety tests including white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophils, platelets, haemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine were measured on day 7 to assess any toxic effects post-vaccination. We graded adverse events and abnormal changes in laboratory tests according to the scale issued by the China State Food and Drug Administration (version 2019).11National Medical Products Administrationhttp://www.nmpa.gov.cn/WS04/CL2138/373037.htmlDate: 2019Date accessed: May 20, 2020Google Scholar Blood samples were taken from participants for serology tests at the scheduled site visits before the vaccination, and on days 14 and 28 after the vaccination. We assessed binding antibody responses against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike glycoprotein with ELISA kits manufactured by Beijing Wantai BioPharm (Beijing, China). A dilution of 1:40 was the positivity cutoff value for ELISA. We also measured the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination using both live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation (virus strain SARS-CoV-2/human/CHN/Wuhan_IME-BJ01/2020, GenBank number MT291831.1) and pseudovirus neutralisation tests (a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirus system expressing the spike glycoprotein).12Nie J Li Q Wu J et al.Establishment and validation of a pseudovirus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2.Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020; 9: 680-686Google Scholar Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood before the vaccination and at days 14 and 28 post-vaccination. Specific T-cell responses were quantified with an interferon (IFN) γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptide pools for about 12–24 h before detection, and expressed as the number of spot-forming cells per 100 000 cells. All measurements were subtracted from the unstimulated control values, and minus values were corrected to zero. The results were considered positive if there was at least a two-times increase in the number of IFNγ secreting T cells post-vaccination. We also assessed the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to vaccination according to the secretion of IFNγ, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), which were measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after the stimulation with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptide pools for about 6 h and detected by flow cytometry. Similar methods to measure T-cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining assays have been reported previously.13Ewer K Rampling T Venkatraman N et al.A monovalent chimpanzee adenovirus Ebola vaccine boosted with MVA.N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 1635-1646Google Scholar,  14De Santis O Audran R Pothin E et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine in healthy adults: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 1/2a study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2016; 16: 311-320Google Scholar The pre-vaccination and post-vaccination anti-Ad5 neutralising antibody titres were detected with a serum neutralisation assay.15Sprangers MC Lakhai W Koudstaal W et al.Quantifying adenovirus-neutralizing antibodies by luciferase transgene detection: addressing preexisting immunity to vaccine and gene therapy vectors.J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41: 5046-5052Google Scholar We analysed all outcomes in the intention-to-treat cohort. The primary endpoint for safety was the occurrence of adverse reactions within 7 days after the vaccination. Any abnormal changes in laboratory measures at 7 days post-vaccination, and adverse events within 28 days across the treatment groups were also analysed as secondary safety endpoints. The specific ELISA antibody titres to RBD and the spike glycoprotein, and the neutralising antibody amounts against live SARS-CoV-2 and a pseudovirus were measured as humoral immunogenicity endpoints. We defined a positive antibody response (seroconversion) as at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titre from baseline. ELISpot IFNγ and positive T-cell responses measured by intracellular cytokine staining assays were compared across the groups as endpoints for cell-mediated responses. Stratified analyses of the immune responses were done based on the pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres among the participants as low or negative (≤1:200) or high (>1:200). The sample size was not determined on the basis of statistical power calculations; however, a minimum sample size of 20–30 participants for a pilot vaccine trial has been recommended by the National Medical Products Administration, China. We assessed the number and proportion of participants with adverse reactions post-vaccination and compared safety profiles across the dose groups. The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were presented as geometric mean titres with 95% CIs and the cellular responses were shown as a proportion of positive responders. We used the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test to analyse categorical data, ANOVA to analyse the log transformed antibody titres, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for data that were not normally distributed. When the overall difference across the three groups was significant, pairwise comparisons were made and the differences between groups were estimated with 95% CIs. Multivariable analysis was used to establish the possible effects on the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine candidates. Hypothesis testing was two-sided with an α value of 0·05. Statistical analyses were done by a statistician using SAS (version 9.4) or GraphPad Prism 8·0·1. SPICE (version 6.0) was used for the analysis of data from multicolour flow cytometry experiments. An independent data and safety monitoring committee, with one independent statistician, one clinician, and one epidemiologist, was established before the start of the trial. Safety data for the first 3 days post-vaccination were assessed and reviewed by the committee to ensure that there was sufficient holding time between dose escalation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04313127.

Between March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 were sequentially enrolled and assigned to receive the low dose (n=36 [33%]), middle dose (n=36 [33%]), or high dose (n=36 [33%]) of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (appendix p 2). All participants completed the vaccination and the scheduled visits within 28 days.

No significant difference in the overall number of adverse reactions across the treatment groups was observed. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients. Pain was reported in 17 (47%) participants in the low dose group, 20 (56%) participants in the middle dose group, and 21 (58%) participants in the high dose group. The most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions overall were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]). Fever was reported in 15 (42%) participants in the low dose group, 15 (42%) participants in the middle dose group, and 20 (56%) participants in the high dose group. Headache was reported in 14 (39%) participants in the low dose group, 11 (31%) participants in the middle dose group, and 17 (47%) participants in the high dose group. Muscle pain was reported in seven (19%) participants in the low dose group, three (8%) participants in the middle dose group, and eight (22%) participants in the high dose group. Most adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Nine participants (two [6%] in the low dose group, two [6%] in the middle dose group, and five [14%] in the high dose group) had an episode of severe fever (grade 3) with axillary temperature greater than 38·5°C. Of them, one (3%) from the high dose group reported severe fever along with severe symptoms of fatigue, dyspnoea, and muscle pain. One participant in the high dose group reported severe fatigue and joint pain (appendix p 3). These reactions occurred within 24 h post-vaccination, and persisted for no more than 48 h. We found no significant difference in the incidences of adverse reactions or overall adverse events among the dose groups. High pre-existing Ad5 immunity (titre of >1:200 vs ≤1:200) was associated with significantly fewer occurrences of fever post-vaccination (odds ratio 0·3, 95% CI 0·1–0·6; appendix p 4). No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days. At day 7 after vaccination, nine (8%) participants had mild to moderate total bilirubin increase, ten (9%) had alanine aminotransferase increase, and four (4%) had fasting hyperglycaemia (appendix p 5), but no instances were considered as clinically significant.Table 2Adverse reactions within 7 days and overall adverse events within 28 days after vaccinationLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)Total (N=108)All adverse reactions within 0–7 daysAny30 (83%)30 (83%)27 (75%)87 (81%)Grade 32 (6%)2 (6%)6 (17%)10 (9%)Injection site adverse reactions within 0–7 daysPain17 (47%)20 (56%)21 (58%)58 (54%)Induration2 (6%)1 (3%)1 (3%)4 (4%)Redness2 (6%)1 (3%)1 (3%)4 (4%)Swelling4 (11%)4 (11%)08 (7%)Itch2 (6%)3 (8%)05 (5%)Muscular weakness001 (3%)1 (1%)Systemic adverse reactions within 0–7 daysFever15 (42%)15 (42%)20 (56%)50 (46%)Grade 3 fever2 (6%)2 (6%)5 (14%)9 (8%)Headache14 (39%)11 (31%)17 (47%)42 (39%)Fatigue17 (47%)14 (39%)16 (44%)47 (44%)Grade 3 fatigue002 (6%)2 (2%)Vomiting1 (3%)01 (3%)2 (2%)Diarrhoea3 (8%)4 (11%)5 (14%)12 (11%)Muscle pain7 (19%)3 (8%)8 (22%)18 (17%)Grade 3 muscle pain001 (3%)1 (1%)Joint pain2 (6%)2 (6%)5 (14%)9 (8%)Grade 3 joint pain001 (3%)1 (1%)Throat pain1 (3%)3 (8%)4 (11%)8 (7%)Cough1 (3%)2 (6%)3 (8%)6 (6%)Nausea2 (6%)1 (3%)3 (8%)6 (6%)Functional GI disorder1 (3%)001 (1%)Dyspnoea002 (6%)2 (2%)Grade 3 dyspnoea001 (3%)1 (1%)Appetite impaired6 (17%)5 (14%)6 (17%)17 (16%)Dizziness1 (3%)01 (3%)2 (2%)Mucosal abnormality001 (3%)1 (1%)Pruritus1 (3%)1 (3%)1 (3%)3 (3%)Overall adverse events within 0–28 daysAny31 (86%)30 (83%)27 (75%)88 (81%)Grade 32 (6%)2 (6%)6 (17%)10 (9%)Data are n (%).

Grade 3=severe (ie, prevented activity). GI=gastrointestinal. Rapid binding antibody responses to RBD were observed in all three dose groups from day 14 (table 3). At day 28, the recipients in the high dose group tended to have a higher binding antibody geometric mean titre of 1445·8 (95% CI 935·5–2234·5), followed by 806·0 (528·2–1229·9) in the middle dose group, and 615·8 (405·4–935·5) in the low dose group (high dose vs low dose 1611·5, 531·5–2691·5). At least a four-fold increase of anti-RBD antibodies was noted in 35 (97%) of 36 participants in the low dose group, 34 (94%) of 36 in the middle dose group, and 36 (100%) of 36 in the high dose group. Neutralising antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 were all negative at day 0, and increased moderately at day 14, peaking at 28 days post-vaccination. Neutralising antibody titre with a geometric mean titre of 34·0 (95% CI 22·6–50·1) was noted in the high dose group, which was significantly higher compared with 16·2 (10·4–25·2) in the middle dose group and 14·5 (9·6–21·8) in the low dose group, with an estimated difference of 27·7 (1·0–54·4) between the high dose group and the middle dose group and 33·2 (6·5–59·9) between the high dose group and the low dose group at day 28. Meanwhile, 18 (50%) participants in the low dose group, 18 (50%) in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) in the high dose group had at least a four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titres by day 28. Similar patterns of the binding antibody to spike glycoprotein and neutralising antibody titre to pseudovirus post-vaccination across the dose groups were also noted (appendix p 6). The association between the ELISA antibodies to RBD and neutralising antibody titres against live virus showed a moderate positive correlation of 0·749, and that between the ELISA antibodies to spike glycoprotein and neutralising antibody titres against live virus was 0·753, at the peak antibody response (p<0·0001). The neutralising antibody titres measured using a pseudovirus were also correlated well with those measured by live SARS-CoV-2 (appendix p 7).Table 3Specific antibody responses to the receptor binding domain, and neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2Day 14Day 28Low dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)p valueLow dose group (n=36)Middle dose group (n=36)High dose group (n=36)p valueELISA antibodies to the receptor binding domainGMT76·5 (44·3–132·0)91·2 (55·9–148·7)132·6 (80·7–218·0)0·29615·8 (405·4–935·5)806·0 (528·2–1229·9)1445·8 (935·5–2234·5)0·016≥4-fold increase16 (44%)18 (50%)22 (61%)0·3535 (97%)34 (94%)36 (100%)0·77Neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2GMT8·2 (5·8–11·5)9·6 (6·6–14·1)12·7 (8·5–19·0)0·2414·5 (9·6–21·8)16·2 (10·4–25·2)34·0 (22·6–50·1)0·0082≥4-fold increase10 (28%)11 (31%)15 (42%)0·4218 (50%)18 (50%)27 (75%)0·046Data are mean (95% CI) or n (%).

Before vaccination, 20 (56%) participants in the low dose group, 19 (53%) participants in the middle dose group, and 16 (44%) participants in the high dose group had a high pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titre (>1:200). Only five (25%) participants of 20 in the low dose group, seven (37%) participants of 19 in the middle dose group, and ten (63%) participants of 16 in the high dose group, who had high pre-existing Ad5 immunity, had at least a four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titre at day 28 post-vaccination (appendix pp 8–10). Multivariable analysis showed that high pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres compromised the seroconversion of neutralising antibody post-vaccination, regardless of the vaccine doses, and recipients aged 45–60 years seemed to have lower seroconversion of neutralising antibody compared with the younger recipients (appendix p 11). The Ad5 neutralising antibodies were significantly boosted post-vaccination (appendix p 12). ELISpot responses at baseline were undetectable with spot-forming cells below the level of detection of the assay in all participants, but peaked at day 14 post-vaccination. The proportions of positive responders ranged from 83–97% across the dose groups, with a mean number of spot-forming cells per 100 000 cells of 20·8 (95% CI 12·7–34·0) in the low dose group, 40·8 (27·6–60·3) in the middle dose group, and 58·0 (39·1–85·9) in the high dose group (figure 1). T-cell responses in the high dose group were significantly higher than that in the low dose group (p<0·0010), but not significant compared with that in the middle dose group. A slight decrease of the T-cell responses across the dose groups was noted at day 28. High levels of baseline Ad5 neutralising antibody titre reduced the peak of post-vaccination T-cell responses in all the dose groups, particularly for the low dose group. Despite the effect of high pre-existing Ad5 immunity, positive responders were identified in 15 (75%) of 20 participants in the low dose group, 18 (95%) of 19 participants in the middle dose group, and 15 (94%) of 16 participants in the high dose group at day 14, and 12 (60%) of 20 participants in the low dose group, 16 (84%) of 19 participants in the middle dose group, and 16 (100%) of 16 participants in the high dose group at day 28.Figure 1Specific T-cell response measured by ELISpotShow full caption(A) The number of specific T cells with secretion of IFNγ at days 0, 14, and 28 in all participants, and stratified by pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody titres.

IFNγ was detected from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after the vaccination at day 14 and 28, in all dose groups (figure 2, appendix p 13). The TNFα expression from CD4+ T cells tended to be significantly lower in the low dose group than that in the high dose (p<0·0001) and middle dose groups (p=0·0032), on day 14. The TNFα expression from CD8+ T cells showed an overall p value of less than 0·0001 across the three groups on day 14. And the TNFα expression from CD8+ T cells tended to be higher in the high dose group than that in both the middle dose group (p=0·016) and the low dose group (p<0·0001). The p values are for the pairwise comparisons between groups. Amounts of IL-2 detected from CD4+ T cells were higher than that detected from CD8+ cells. The proportions of polyfunctional phenotypes detected from memory CD4+ T cells were higher than those from CD8+ T cells. Higher proportions of polyfunctional phenotypes were noted with the higher vaccine doses. We also noted that pre-existing Ad5 neutralising antibody had a negative effect on the pattern of T-cell responses (appendix pp 14–16). A post-hoc analysis showed that 28 (78%) participants in the low dose group, 33 (92%) participants in the middle dose group, and 36 (100%) participants in the high dose group showed either positive T-cell responses to spike glycoprotein or seroconversion of neutralising antibody to live SARS-CoV-2, at day 28 post-vaccination (appendix p 17).Figure 2Flow cytometry with intracellular cytokine staining before and after vaccinationShow full caption(A) Percentage of cells secreting IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 from CD4+ T cells.

To exclude any possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the study period, we tested the serum antibodies to nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in participants at day 28 using a special IgG/IgM rapid test kit (Vazyme Biotech, number CD101, Nanjing, China), but none of the participants were positive. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a first-in-human clinical trial of a novel Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerated in healthy adults in all three dose groups. The most common adverse reactions were fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain with no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions across the groups. Most adverse events reported were mild or moderate in severity. We noticed a higher reactogenicity profile of the high dose at 1·5 × 1011 viral particles, presenting as severe fever, fatigue, muscle pain, or joint pain, which might be associated with viraemia caused by Ad5 vector infection. However, the severe adverse reactions were transient and self-limiting. Additionally, no abnormal changes in laboratory measurements were clinically significant or considered to be related to the vaccine. The profile of adverse events reported in this trial is similar to that of another Ad5 vector-based Ebola vaccine expressing glycoprotein.16Zhu FC Hou LH Li JX et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a novel recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine in healthy adults in China: preliminary report of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial.Lancet. 2015; 385: 2272-2279Google Scholar To accelerate the process of clinical evaluation of the candidate COVID-19 vaccine, we selected doses for the phase 2 study mainly on the basis of the safety profile of the candidate vaccines shown in the participants within 7 days and 14 days post-vaccination. We chose the low dose (5 × 1010 viral particles) and middle dose (1 × 1011 viral particles) to be further assessed in a phase 2 clinical trial. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was immunogenic, inducing humoral and T-cell responses rapidly in most participants. Onset of detectable immune responses was rapid, with T-cell responses peaking at day 14 after vaccination and antibodies peaking at day 28. The antibody response to the vaccine in the high dose group was slightly greater than that in the middle dose and low dose groups. A single dose of Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was able to elicit a four-fold increase in binding antibodies to RBD in 94–100% of participants, and a four-fold increase to live virus in 50–75% of participants. Despite differences in magnitudes of the antibodies measured through different methods, there was a strong positive correlation between binding antibodies and neutralising antibody titres to the live virus. High proportions of participants with positive T-cell responses were noted across the all dose groups post-vaccination. The activation of both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was observed in vaccine recipients, particularly for antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. However, both the specific antibody response and T-cell response induced by vaccination were partly diminished by the presence of high pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity. Currently, correlates of protection for a vaccine against COVID-19 are unknown, and the roles of the specific antibodies or T cells in building effective protection are not yet defined. Therefore, we are unable to predict the protection of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine on the basis of the vaccine-elicited immune responses in this study. However, previous studies investigating SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) found that the increases in specific antibodies were temporary, and declined quickly in patients after recovery, whereas the specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses played an essential role in immunity.17Zhao J Zhao J Perlman S T cell responses are required for protection from clinical disease and for virus clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected mice.J Virol. 2010; 84: 9318-9325Google Scholar,  18Channappanavar R Fett C Zhao J Meyerholz DK Perlman S Virus-specific memory CD8 T cells provide substantial protection from lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.J Virol. 2014; 88: 11034-11044Google Scholar A similar rapid decline of the specific antibody amounts in patients with COVID-19 after recovery was also noted,19Wang X Guo X Xin Q et al.Neutralizing antibodies responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients.medRxiv. 2020;  (DOI: 2020.04.15.20065623 (preprint))Google Scholar,  20Wu F Wang A Liu M et al.Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications.medRxiv. 2020;  (DOI: 2020.03.30.20047365 (preprint))Google Scholar suggesting that both specific cellular and humoral immunity are potentially important for a successful COVID-19 vaccine. Here, we only report the data within 28 days after the vaccination, but we are going to follow up the vaccine recipients for at least 6 months, so more data will be obtained. This study was done in Wuhan, Hubei province, which was the centre of the COVID-19 epidemic in China.21Chen N Zhou M Dong X et al.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 507-513Google Scholar People living in the city of Wuhan had a much higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those living in other cities outside of Hubei province, even though when we initiated this trial, the city had already begun lockdown and implemented mandatory home isolation for residents. Therefore, we did serological screening, nucleic acid testing, and chest CT to exclude participants who had been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during recruitment. In addition, we arranged for all participants in our study to stay in a designated hotel for 14 days post-vaccination. This arrangement facilitated the observation of adverse events after the immunisation of the participants, and reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the following 2 weeks. These measures allowed the study to be done successfully without interference by the circulation of SARS-CoV-2, which is especially important in the absence of a placebo control. Interpretation of the results of this study is limited by the small size of the cohort, the short duration of follow-up, and the absence of a randomised control group. As it was a first-in-human study of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine, it was not designed to measure the vaccine efficacy. However, in preclinical studies, seven out of eight ferrets were protected from having detectable virus copies when challenged by SARS-CoV-2 through nasal dripping 21 days after immunisation with the vaccine, whereas only one out of eight ferrets in the control group was negative for virus copies (Wei C, unpublished). We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the candidate vaccine in healthy adults, with no interference by underlying diseases or medicines. However, results of our study indicated that older age could have a negative effect on the vaccine-elicited responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this trial, no participants were older than 60 years and only 16% of the participants were older than 50 years, providing limited information on the capability of generating a potent cellular and humoral response in the older population. Since age has also been identified as an independent risk factor for severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,4Weiss P Murdoch DR Clinical course and mortality risk of severe COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1014-1015Google Scholar,  22Ye G Pan Z Pan Y et al.Clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reactivation.J Infect. 2020; 80: e14-e17Google Scholar and there is a possibility that an even lower immune response might be found in the older population, we are going to include participants who are older than 60 years in the phase 2 study considering this population as an important target population for a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, experience with vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS have raised concerns about the antibody-dependent enhancement in participants who are infected with a circulating SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination.23Lurie N Saville M Hatchett R Halton J Developing Covid-19 vaccines at pandemic speed.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (NEJMp2005630.)Google Scholar However, this study was not statistically powered to measure any safety outcome, especially for the concerns around immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement events associated with the full-length spike glycoprotein vaccine antigen.24Cao X COVID-19: immunopathology and its implications for therapy.Nat Rev Immunol. 2020; 20: 269-270Google Scholar Our study found that the pre-existing Ad5 immunity could slow down the rapid immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and also lower the peak of the responses, particularly for humoral immunity. The high pre-existing Ad5 immunity might also have a negative effect on the persistence of the vaccine-elicited immune responses. In previous studies, heterologous prime-boost combinations or homologous prime-boost regimens with Ad5 vectored vaccines were shown to be able to induce more strong and durable immunogenic responses in populations with high pre-existing Ad5 immunity.25Venkatraman N Ndiaye BP Bowyer G et al.Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous prime-boost Ebola virus vaccine regimen in healthy adults in the United Kingdom and Senegal.J Infect Dis. 2019; 219: 1187-1197Google Scholar,  26Dolzhikova IV Zubkova OV Tukhvatulin AI et al.Safety and immunogenicity of GamEvac-Combi, a heterologous VSV- and Ad5-vectored Ebola vaccine: an open phase I/II trial in healthy adults in Russia.Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017; 13: 613-620Google Scholar,  27Shukarev G Callendret B Luhn K Douoguih M A two-dose heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimen eliciting sustained immune responses to Ebola Zaire could support a preventive strategy for future outbreaks.Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017; 13: 266-270Google Scholar Nevertheless, limited information is available for the effects of multiple doses of the candidate Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in humans, which warrants further investigation.

We plan to monitor the participants in our upcoming phase 2 and phase 3 studies to assess the indication for any such acquisition. In conclusion, we found that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic in healthy adults. Specific humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination, and rapid, specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 after one shot of the vaccine. There is potential for further investigation of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine for the control of the COVID-19 outbreak. An ongoing phase 2 trial in China (NCT04341389) will provide more information on the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine. Contributors F-CZ and Y-HL were co-first authors.

There is an urgent need for effective treatment. Current focus has been on the development of novel therapeutics, including antivirals and vaccines. Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome. We recommend identification and treatment of hyperinflammation using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality. Current management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality.2Ruan Q Yang K Wang W Jiang L Song J Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China.Intensive Care Med. 2020;  (published online March 3.)DOI:10.1007/s00134-020-05991-xGoogle Scholar Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is an under-recognised, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure.

Following the pneumonia cases of unknown cause reported in Wuhan and considering the shared history of exposure to Huanan seafood market across the patients, an epidemiological alert was released by the local health authority on Dec 31, 2019, and the market was shut down on Jan 1, 2020. Meanwhile, 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were transferred to a designated hospital starting from Dec 31, 2019. An expert team of physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, and government officials was soon formed after the alert. Since the cause was unknown at the onset of these emerging infections, the diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan was based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia. Suspected patients were isolated using airborne precautions in the designated hospital, Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China), and fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures were taken. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Local centres for disease control and prevention collected respiratory, blood, and faeces specimens, then shipped them to designated authoritative laboratories to detect the pathogen (NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Mérieux Laboratory, Beijing, China). A novel coronavirus, which was named 2019-nCoV, was isolated then from lower respiratory tract specimen and a diagnostic test for this virus was developed soon after that.14Tan W Zhao X Ma X et al.A novel coronavirus genome identified in a cluster of pneumonia cases — Wuhan, China 2019−2020.http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/a3907201-f64f-4154-a19e-4253b453d10cDate accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Of 59 suspected cases, 41 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. The presence of 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens was detected by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. The primers and probe target to envelope gene of CoV were used and the sequences were as follows: forward primer 5′-ACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTTTCGTGGT-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCAGCAGTACGCACACAATC-3′; and the probe 5′CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3′BHQ1. Conditions for the amplifications were 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s. Initial investigations included a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes). Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, or bronchial aspirates were tested for common viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed. Given the emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases during the influenza season, antibiotics (orally and intravenously) and oseltamivir (orally 75 mg twice daily) were empirically administered. Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 40–120 mg per day) was given as a combined regimen if severe community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed by physicians at the designated hospital. Oxygen support (eg, nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) was administered to patients according to the severity of hypoxaemia. Repeated tests for 2019-nCoV were done in patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection to show viral clearance before hospital discharge or discontinuation of isolation. We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays for all patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection who were reported by the local health authority. The admission data of these patients was from Dec 16, 2019, to Jan 2, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardised data collection forms (modified case record form for severe acute respiratory infection clinical characterisation shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) from electronic medical records. Two researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected. To ascertain the epidemiological and symptom data, which were not available from electronic medical records, the researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. To characterise the effect of coronavirus on the production of cytokines or chemokines in the acute phase of the illness, plasma cytokines and chemokines (IL1B, IL1RA, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8 (also known as CXCL8), IL9, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL15, IL17A, Eotaxin (also known as CCL11), basic FGF2, GCSF (CSF3), GMCSF (CSF2), IFNγ, IP10 (CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2), MIP1A (CCL3), MIP1B (CCL4), PDGFB, RANTES (CCL5), TNFα, and VEGFA were measured using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma samples from four healthy adults were used as controls for cross-comparison. The median time from being transferred to a designated hospital to the blood sample collection was 4 days (IQR 2–5). Each 80 μL plasma sample from the patients and contacts was added into 240 μL of Trizol LS (10296028; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 μL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 μL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final reaction mix concentration of the primers was 500 nM and probe was 200 nM. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: 50°C for 15 min and 95°C for 3 min, 50 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 45 s. Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead. RNAaemia was defined as a positive result for real-time RT-PCR in the plasma sample. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock were defined according to the interim guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus.9WHONovel coronavirus – China.http://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/Date: Jan 12, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) of less than 300 mm Hg.15Sanz F Gimeno C Lloret T et al.Relationship between the presence of hypoxemia and the inflammatory response measured by C-reactive protein in bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia.Eur Respir J. 2011; 38: 2492Google Scholar Acute kidney injury was identified and classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification.16Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) acute kidney injury work groupKDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury.https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guideline-English.pdfDate: March, 2012Date accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Secondary infection was diagnosed if the patients had clinical symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteraemia, and was combined with a positive culture of a new pathogen from a lower respiratory tract specimen (including the sputum, transtracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or from blood samples taken ≥48 h after admission).17Garner JS Jarvis WR Emori TG Horan TC Hughes JM CDC definitions for nosocomial infections, 1988.Am J Infect Control. 1988; 16: 128-140Google Scholar Cardiac injury followed the definition used in our previous study in H7N9 patients.18Gao C Wang Y Gu X et al.Association between cardiac injury and mortality in hospitalized patients infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus.Crit Care Med. 2020;  (published online Jan 20)DOI:10.1097/CCM.0000000000004207Google Scholar In brief, cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography. Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared by χ2 test or Fisher's exact test between ICU care and no ICU care groups. Boxplots were drawn to describe plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations. A two-sided α of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software, version 9.4, unless otherwise indicated.

The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan. 20 [49%]) of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients were aged 25–49 years, and 14 (34%) were aged 50–64 years (figure 1A). The median age of the patients was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0; table 1). In our cohort of the first 41 patients as of Jan 2, no children or adolescents were infected. Of the 41 patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to the ICU because they required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxaemia. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%]); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).Figure 1Date of illness onset and age distribution of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infectionShow full caption(A) Number of hospital admissions by age group.

ICU=intensive care unit. 27 (66%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market (figure 1B). Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care (nine [69%]) and those with non-ICU care (18 [64%]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The first fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38; table 1). More than half of patients (22 [55%] of 40) developed dyspnoea. The median duration from illness onset to dyspnoea was 8·0 days (IQR 5·0–13·0). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7·0 days (4·0–8·0), to shortness of breath was 8·0 days (5·0–13·0), to ARDS was 9·0 days (8·0–14·0), to mechanical ventilation was 10·5 days (7·0–14·0), and to ICU admission was 10·5 days (8·0–17·0; figure 2).Figure 2Timeline of 2019-nCoV cases after onset of illnessView Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) The blood counts of patients on admission showed leucopenia (white blood cell count less than 4 × 109/L; ten [25%] of 40 patients) and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1·0 × 109/L; 26 [63%] patients; table 2). Prothrombin time and D-dimer level on admission were higher in ICU patients (median prothrombin time 12·2 s [IQR 11·2–13·4]; median D-dimer level 2·4 mg/L [0·6–14·4]) than non-ICU patients (median prothrombin time 10·7 s [9·8–12·1], p=0·012; median D-dimer level 0·5 mg/L [0·3–0·8], p=0·0042). Levels of aspartate aminotransferase were increased in 15 (37%) of 41 patients, including eight (62%) of 13 ICU patients and seven (25%) of 28 non-ICU patients. Hypersensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) was increased substantially in five patients, in whom the diagnosis of virus-related cardiac injury was made.Table 2Laboratory findings of patients infected with 2019-nCoV on admission to hospitalAll patients (n=41)ICU care (n=13)No ICU care (n=28)p valueWhite blood cell count, × 109/L6·2 (4·1–10·5)11·3 (5·8–12·1)5·7 (3·1–7·6)0·011<410/40 (25%)1/13 (8%)9/27 (33%)0·0414–1018/40 (45%)5/13 (38%)13/27 (48%)..>1012/40 (30%)7/13 (54%)5/27 (19%)..Neutrophil count, × 109/L5·0 (3·3–8·9)10·6 (5·0–11·8)4·4 (2·0–6·1)0·00069Lymphocyte count, × 109/L0·8 (0·6–1·1)0·4 (0·2–0·8)1·0 (0·7–1·1)0·0041<1·026/41 (63%)11/13 (85%)15/28 (54%)0·045≥1·015/41 (37%)2/13 (15%)13/28 (46%)..Haemoglobin, g/L126·0 (118·0–140·0)122·0 (111·0–128·0)130·5 (120·0–140·0)0·20Platelet count, × 109/L164·5 (131·5–263·0)196·0 (165·0–263·0)149·0 (131·0–263·0)0·45<1002/40 (5%)1/13 (8%)1/27 (4%)0·45≥10038/40 (95%)12/13 (92%)26/27 (96%)..Prothrombin time, s11·1 (10·1–12·4)12·2 (11·2–13·4)10·7 (9·8–12·1)0·012Activated partial thromboplastin time, s27·0 (24·2–34·1)26·2 (22·5–33·9)27·7 (24·8–34·1)0·57D-dimer, mg/L0·5 (0·3–1·3)2·4 (0·6–14·4)0·5 (0·3–0·8)0·0042Albumin, g/L31·4 (28·9–36·0)27·9 (26·3–30·9)34·7 (30·2–36·5)0·00066Alanine aminotransferase, U/L32·0 (21·0–50·0)49·0 (29·0–115·0)27·0 (19·5–40·0)0·038Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L34·0 (26·0–48·0)44·0 (30·0–70·0)34·0 (24·0–40·5)0·10≤4026/41 (63%)5/13 (38%)21/28 (75%)0·025>4015/41 (37%)8/13 (62%)7/28 (25%)..Total bilirubin, mmol/L11·7 (9·5–13·9)14·0 (11·9–32·9)10·8 (9·4–12·3)0·011Potassium, mmol/L4·2 (3·8–4·8)4·6 (4·0–5·0)4·1 (3·8–4·6)0·27Sodium, mmol/L139·0 (137·0–140·0)138·0 (137·0–139·0)139·0 (137·5–140·5)0·26Creatinine, μmol/L74·2 (57·5–85·7)79·0 (53·1–92·7)73·3 (57·5–84·7)0·84≤13337/41 (90%)11/13 (85%)26/28 (93%)0·42>1334/41 (10%)2/13 (15%)2/28 (7%)..Creatine kinase, U/L132·5 (62·0–219·0)132·0 (82·0–493·0)133·0 (61·0–189·0)0·31≤18527/40 (68%)7/13 (54%)20/27 (74%)0·21>18513/40 (33%)6/13 (46%)7/27 (26%)..Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L286·0 (242·0–408·0)400·0 (323·0–578·0)281·0 (233·0–357·0)0·0044≤24511/40 (28%)1/13 (8%)10/27 (37%)0·036>24529/40 (73%)12/13 (92%)17/27 (63%)..Hypersensitive troponin I, pg/mL3·4 (1·1–9·1)3·3 (3·0–163·0)3·5 (0·7–5·4)0·075>28 (99th percentile)5/41 (12%)4/13 (31%)1/28 (4%)0·017Procalcitonin, ng/mL0·1 (0·1–0·1)0·1 (0·1–0·4)0·1 (0·1–0·1)0·031<0·127/39 (69%)6/12 (50%)21/27 (78%)0·029≥0·1 to <0·257/39 (18%)3/12 (25%)4/27 (15%)..≥0·25 to <0·52/39 (5%)0/122/27 (7%)..≥0·53/39 (8%)3/12 (25%)** Complicated typical secondary infection during the first hospitalisation.0/27..Bilateral involvement of chest radiographs40/41 (98%)13/13 (100%)27/28 (96%)0·68Cycle threshold of respiratory tract32·2 (31·0–34·5)31·1 (30·0–33·5)32·2 (31·1–34·7)0·39Data are median (IQR) or n/N (%), where N is the total number of patients with available data. p values comparing ICU care and no ICU care are from χ2, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test. 2019-nCoV=2019 novel coronavirus.

Three of the four patients with secondary infection had procalcitonin greater than 0·5 ng/mL (0·69 ng/mL, 1·46 ng/mL, and 6·48 ng/mL). On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. Of the 41 patients, 40 (98%) had bilateral involvement (table 2). The typical findings of chest CT images of ICU patients on admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3A). The representative chest CT findings of non-ICU patients showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3B). Later chest CT images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, whereas the consolidation had been resolved (figure 3C).Figure 3Chest CT imagesShow full caption(A) Transverse chest CT images from a 40-year-old man showing bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation on day 15 after symptom onset.

Initial plasma IL1B, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNFα, and VEGF concentrations were higher in both ICU patients and non-ICU patients than in healthy adults (appendix pp 6–7). Plasma levels of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between healthy adults and patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Further comparison between ICU and non-ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα were higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients. All patients had pneumonia. Common complications included ARDS (12 [29%] of 41 patients), followed by RNAaemia (six [15%] patients), acute cardiac injury (five [12%] patients), and secondary infection (four [10%] patients; table 3). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in four (10%) patients, with two of them (5%) had refractory hypoxaemia and received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as salvage therapy.

Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least 10 days, with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from upper respiratory tract. We report here a cohort of 41 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Patients had serious, sometimes fatal, pneumonia and were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan, China, by Jan 2, 2020. Clinical presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. The time between hospital admission and ARDS was as short as 2 days. At this stage, the mortality rate is high for 2019-nCoV, because six (15%) of 41 patients in this cohort died. The number of deaths is rising quickly. As of Jan 24, 2020, 835 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections were reported in China, with 25 fatal cases. Reports have been released of exported cases in many provinces in China, and in other countries; some health-care workers have also been infected in Wuhan. Taken together, evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019-nCoV. We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission.19Perlman S Netland J Coronaviruses post-SARS: update on replication and pathogenesis.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009; 7: 439-450Google Scholar Airborne precautions, such as a fit-tested N95 respirator, and other personal protective equipment are strongly recommended. To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored among health-care workers. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymptomatic infections. Similarities of clinical features between 2019-nCoV and previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans. These features of 2019-nCoV infection bear some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.20Lee N Hui D Wu A et al.A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.N Engl J Med. 2003; 348: 1986-1994Google Scholar,  21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761Google Scholar However, few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway. Furthermore, 2019-nCoV patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhoea), whereas about 20–25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhoea.21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761Google Scholar Faecal and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage. The pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum (eg, IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1) were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103Google Scholar MERS-CoV infection was also reported to induce increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL15, and IL17).23Mahallawi WH Khabour OF Zhang Q Makhdoum HM Suliman BA MERS-CoV infection in humans is associated with a pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokine profile.Cytokine. 2018; 104: 8-13Google Scholar We noted that patients infected with 2019-nCoV also had high amounts of IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity. However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103Google Scholar Further studies are necessary to characterise the Th1 and Th2 responses in 2019-nCoV infection and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Autopsy or biopsy studies would be the key to understand the disease. In view of the high amount of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV,22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103Google Scholar,  24He L Ding Y Zhang Q et al.Expression of elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in SARS-CoV-infected ACE2+ cells in SARS patients: relation to the acute lung injury and pathogenesis of SARS.J Pathol. 2006; 210: 288-297Google Scholar MERS-CoV,25Faure E Poissy J Goffard A et al.Distinct immune response in two MERS-CoV-infected patients: can we go from bench to bedside?.PLoS One. 2014; 9e88716Google Scholar,  26Falzarano D de Wit E Rasmussen AL et al.Treatment with interferon-α2b and ribavirin improves outcome in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques.Nat Med. 2013; 19: 1313-1317Google Scholar and 2019-nCoV infections, corticosteroids were used frequently for treatment of patients with severe illness, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury. However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance.27Stockman LJ Bellamy R Garner P SARS: systematic review of treatment effects.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e343Google Scholar,  28Lansbury L Rodrigo C Leonardi-Bee J Nguyen-Van-Tam J Lim WS Corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019; 2: CD010406Google Scholar,  29Arabi YM Mandourah Y Al-Hameed F et al.Corticosteroid therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome.Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2018; 197: 757-767Google Scholar Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance.30WHOClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.https://www.who.int/internal-publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspectedDate: Jan 11, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Among our cohort of 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection, corticosteroids were given to very few non-ICU cases, and low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids were given to less than half of severely ill patients with ARDS. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients infected with 2019-nCoV. No antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. In a historical control study,31Chu CM Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Google Scholar the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes). Arabi and colleagues initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection in Saudi Arabia.32Arabi YM Alothman A Balkhy HH et al.Treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome with a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-β1b (MIRACLE trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.Trials. 2018; 19: 81Google Scholar Preclinical evidence showed the potent efficacy of remdesivir (a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug) to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections.33Sheahan TP Sims AC Graham RL et al.Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses.Sci Transl Med. 2017; 9eaal3653Google Scholar,  34Sheahan TP Sims AC Leist SR et al.Comparative therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir and combination lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 222Google Scholar As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus. Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection. Our study has some limitations. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariable-adjusted methods. This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity. At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively.35Cui J Li F Shi Z-L Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2019; 17: 181-192Google Scholar Extensive research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has driven the discovery of many SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses in bats.

Reliable quick pathogen tests and feasible differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians in their first contact with suspected patients. Because of the pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaption, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.

We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.MethodsWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.FindingsUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.InterpretationThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.FundingUK Medical Research Council.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, SSRN, Research Square, Virological, and Wellcome Open Research for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the search terms “coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, and similar terms, and “fatality”, up to March 6, 2020. Several studies have estimated the case fatality ratio (the percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed disease who die from the disease) and infection fatality ratio (the percentage of all infected individuals who die from the disease, including those with mild disease) of COVID-19 using a range of different statistical and modelling methods. Studies done solely in hospitalised patients report the highest fatality ratios (8–28%), representing the outcome for the most severely ill patients. Estimates of the population-level case fatality ratio from all case reports are in the range of 2–8%. Estimates of the infection fatality ratio averaged across all age-groups range from 0·2% to 1·6%, while estimates of the infection fatality ratio in the oldest age group (≥80 years) range from 8% to 36%. None of the identified studies had adjusted for differences in the denominator populations to obtain estimates that could be applied across populations. No other studies have estimated the proportion of infected individuals who will require hospitalisation.Added value of this studyBy synthesising data from across a range of surveillance settings, we obtained estimates of the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio that take into account the different denominator populations in the datasets. Our underlying assumption, that attack rates (ie, the probability of becoming infected) do not vary substantially by age, is consistent with previous studies for respiratory infections. Under this assumption, differences in age patterns among cases in Wuhan versus those elsewhere in China would probably due to under-ascertainment of cases, given the different surveillance systems in place. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis, with cases in Wuhan seen in older individuals, who would have been identified through attendance at hospital, whereas cases elsewhere in China being younger overall, which would be explained by the policy of testing those with a travel history to Wuhan. After correcting for these biases, we found that estimates of the case fatality ratio from China are consistent with those obtained from early international cases. Our age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio can be applied to any demography to give an estimate of the infection fatality ratio in older and younger populations. These estimates can be combined with estimates of the infection attack rate (approximately 80% for an unmitigated epidemic) to give rough projections of scale. Similarly, our estimates of the proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation can be combined with the infection attack rate to forecast health-care requirements.Implications of all the available evidenceOur estimates of the case fatality ratio for COVID-19, although lower than some of the crude estimates made to date, are substantially higher than for recent influenza pandemics (eg, H1N1 influenza in 2009). With the rapid geographical spread observed to date, COVID-19 therefore represents a major global health threat in the coming weeks and months. Our estimate of the proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation, when combined with likely infection attack rates (around 50–80%), show that even the most advanced health-care systems are likely to be overwhelmed. These estimates are therefore crucial to enable countries around the world to best prepare as the global pandemic continues to unfold. Evidence before this study We searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, SSRN, Research Square, Virological, and Wellcome Open Research for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the search terms “coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, and similar terms, and “fatality”, up to March 6, 2020. Several studies have estimated the case fatality ratio (the percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed disease who die from the disease) and infection fatality ratio (the percentage of all infected individuals who die from the disease, including those with mild disease) of COVID-19 using a range of different statistical and modelling methods. Studies done solely in hospitalised patients report the highest fatality ratios (8–28%), representing the outcome for the most severely ill patients. Estimates of the population-level case fatality ratio from all case reports are in the range of 2–8%. Estimates of the infection fatality ratio averaged across all age-groups range from 0·2% to 1·6%, while estimates of the infection fatality ratio in the oldest age group (≥80 years) range from 8% to 36%.

These estimates are therefore crucial to enable countries around the world to best prepare as the global pandemic continues to unfold. Assessing the severity of COVID-19 is crucial to determine the appropriateness of mitigation strategies and to enable planning for health-care needs as epidemics unfold. However, crude case fatality ratios obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases can be misleading.9Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar,  10Lipsitch M Donnelly CA Fraser C et al.Potential biases in estimating absolute and relative case-fatality risks during outbreaks.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015; 9e0003846Google Scholar First, there can be a period of 2–3 weeks between a person developing symptoms, the case subsequently being detected and reported, and observation of the final clinical outcome. During a growing epidemic, the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown. Simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true case fatality ratio early in an epidemic.9Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar,  10Lipsitch M Donnelly CA Fraser C et al.Potential biases in estimating absolute and relative case-fatality risks during outbreaks.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015; 9e0003846Google Scholar,  11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Google Scholar This effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)12Donnelly CA Ghani AC Leung GM et al.Epidemiological determinants of spread of causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1761-1766Google Scholar and H1N19Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar influenza, and as such is widely recognised. Thus, many of the estimates of the case fatality ratio that have been obtained to date for COVID-19 correct for this effect.13Jung S Akhmetzhanov AR Hayashi K et al.Real-time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: inference using exported cases.J Clin Med. 2020; 9: E523Google Scholar,  14Mizumoto K Kagaya K Chowell G Yoshida-Nakaadachi-cho U Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan City: China, January–February, 2020.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 13.)

Ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated case fatality ratio downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic. Second, surveillance of a newly emerged pathogen is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases, especially at the start of an epidemic when diagnostic capacity is low (figure 1). Estimates of the case fatality ratio can thus be biased upwards until the extent of clinically milder disease is determined.9Garske T Legrand J Donnelly CA et al.Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.BMJ. 2009; 339b2840Google Scholar Data from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan have primarily been obtained through hospital surveillance and, thus, are likely to represent patients with moderate or severe illness, with atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress being used to define suspected cases eligible for testing.7Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology TeamThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China.Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020; 41 (in Chinese).: 145-151Google Scholar In these individuals, clinical outcomes are likely to be more severe, so any estimates of the case fatality ratio will be higher. Elsewhere in mainland China and the rest of the world, countries and administrative regions alert to the risk of infection being imported via travel initially instituted surveillance for COVID-19 with a broader set of clinical criteria for defining a suspected case. These criteria typically included a combination of symptoms (eg, cough and fever) combined with recent travel history to the affected region (Wuhan, or Hubei province)2Chan JFW Yuan S Kok KH et al.A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster.Lancet. 2020; 395: 514-523Google Scholar,  17Xu XW Wu XX Jiang XG et al.Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series.BMJ. 2020; 368: m606Google Scholar. Such surveillance is likely to detect clinically mild cases but, by initially restricting testing to those with a travel history or link, might have missed other symptomatic cases.Figure 1Spectrum of COVID-19 casesShow full captionAt the top of the pyramid, those meeting the WHO case criteria for severe or critical cases are likely to be identified in the hospital setting, presenting with atypical viral pneumonia.

These cases will have been identified through links to international travel to high-risk areas and through contact-tracing of contacts of confirmed cases.

Here we attempt to adjust for these biases in data sources to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio (proportion of all cases that will eventually lead to death) and infection fatality ratio (the proportion of all infections that will eventually lead to death) using both individual-level case report data and aggregate case and death counts from mainland China, from Hong Kong and Macau, and international case reports. By adjusting for both underlying demography and potential under-ascertainment at different levels of the severity pyramid (figure 1), these estimates should be broadly applicable across a range of settings to inform health planning while more detailed case data accrue. We identified information on the characteristics of 48 patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, reported by the National Health Commission and the Hubei Province Health Commission website up to Feb 8, 2020. We recorded the following data elements, where available: sex, age, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, and date of death. Of the 48 cases, neither the date of symptom onset nor the date of report was available for 13 cases. We also removed eight cases with onset before Jan 1, 2020, or death before Jan 21, 2020, and three deaths after Jan 28, 2020, which were the dates consistent with reliable reporting of onset and death in this setting, respectively, considering the onset-to-death times (including early onsets creates a bias towards long onset-to-death times, reflecting under-ascertainment of deaths early on). This left 24 deaths, which we used to estimate the onset-to-death distribution. We collated data on 2010 cases reported in 37 countries and two special administrative regions of China (Hong Kong and Macau), from government or ministry of health websites and media reports, until Feb 25, 2020. We recorded the following information where available: country or administrative region in which the case was detected, whether the infection was acquired in China or abroad, date of travel, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, date of confirmation, date of recovery, and date of death. We used data from 165 recovered individuals with reported recovery dates and reported or imputed onset dates to estimate the onset-to-recovery distribution, after excluding 26 recoveries without appropriate information on dates of recovery, report, or locality. We used data on 1334 international cases to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio, not including cases without dates of report. Data on 70 117 PCR-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases by date of onset in Wuhan and elsewhere in China from Jan 1 to Feb 11, 2020, were extracted from the WHO–China Joint Mission report.8WHOReport of the WHO-China Joint Mission on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).https://www.who.int/publications-detail/report-of-the-who-china-joint-mission-on-coronavirus-disease-2019-(covid-19)Date: Feb 28, 2020Date accessed: March 26, 2020Google Scholar Over this period a total of 1023 deaths were reported across China, with these data available disaggregated into 10-year age bands between 0–9 years and 70–79 years old, and a further age band for those aged 80 years or older.7Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology TeamThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China.Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020; 41 (in Chinese).: 145-151Google Scholar Using collated data on daily reported deaths obtained each day from the National Health Commission regional websites, we estimated that 74% of deaths occurred in Wuhan and the remainder outside Wuhan.

Data on infection prevalence in repatriated expatriates returning to their home countries were obtained from government or ministry of health websites and media reports. To match to the incidence reported in Wuhan on Jan 30, 2020, we used data from six flights that departed between Jan 30 and Feb 1, 2020, inclusive. In early February 2020 a cruise liner named the Diamond Princess was quarantined after a disembarked passenger tested positive for the virus. Subsequently all 3711 passengers on board were tested over the next month. We extracted data on the ages of passengers onboard on Feb 5, 2020, the dates of positive test reports, which were available for 657 out of 712 PCR-confirmed cases, and the dates of ten deaths among these cases from the reports of the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare19Government of JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare.https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e.htmlDate: 2020Date accessed: March 26, 2020Google Scholar and international media.

In estimating time intervals between symptom onset and outcome, it was necessary to account for the fact that, during a growing epidemic, a higher proportion of the cases will have been infected recently (appendix p 7). Therefore, we re-parameterised a gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 0·14 per day, obtained from the early case onset data (appendix p 6). Using Bayesian methods, we fitted gamma distributions to the data on time from onset to death and onset to recovery, conditional on having observed the final outcome. Missing onset dates were imputed on the basis of dates of report, where available. Estimates of the distribution of times from onset-to-death were used to project the expected cumulative number of deaths given the onsets observed in Wuhan and outside Wuhan, assuming a uniform attack rate across age groups. Using the age-distribution of the population, we obtained an estimate of the expected number of infections in each age group. Under-ascertainment was estimated in and outside of Wuhan by comparing the number of observed cases by age to this expected distribution, assuming perfect ascertainment in the 50–59 age group as this group had the highest number of detected cases relative to population size. We also did a sensitivity analysis assuming a differential attack rate by age (appendix p 9). For Wuhan, we added scaling to account for further under-ascertainment compared with outside of Wuhan. These steps gave us the expected age-distribution of cases. For a given onset-to-death distribution, we obtained a modelled estimate of the cumulative number of deaths by age under an age-dependent case fatality ratio (fitted relative to the case fatality ratio in the oldest age group, which represented the highest crude case fatality ratio). This estimate was compared with the observed deaths by age using a Poisson likelihood. These data were then jointly fitted alongside the most recent age-aggregated cumulative deaths and cases in mainland China. Given that the numbers of observed cases and deaths have dropped substantially following a peak in late January, the ratio of current cumulative cases to current number of deaths, once corrected for under-ascertainment, should provide a good estimate of the final case fatality ratio.11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Google Scholar To estimate the infection fatality ratio we fitted to data on infection prevalence from international Wuhan residents who were repatriated to their home countries. Our age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio model was jointly fitted to the case data and infection prevalence data with use of Bayesian methods, using our previous estimate of the onset-to-death distribution as a prior. Full mathematical details are provided in the appendix (p 8). Assuming a uniform attack rate by age groups, we used the demography-adjusted under-ascertainment rates calculated above to obtain an estimate of the proportion of infected individuals who would require hospitalisation. To independently validate our infection fatality ratio estimate, we analysed data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise liner taking the dates of reported positive tests as a proxy for onset date. We calculated the expected proportion of deaths observed until March 25, 2020, given the onset times and estimated onset-to-death distribution (appendix p 13). We used parametric and non-parametric methods11Ghani AC Donnelly CA Cox DR et al.Methods for estimating the case fatality ratio for a novel, emerging infectious disease.Am J Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 479-486Google Scholar,  22Griffin J Ghani A CASEFAT: Stata module for estimating the case fatality ratio of a new infectious disease.

Cases in which the outcome was unknown were treated as censored observations. For parametric and non-parametric analyses, missing onset dates were multiply imputed using information on the onset-to-report distribution, and unreported recoveries were imputed using onset-to-outcome distributions and country summary data. The parametric models were fitted to the data using Bayesian methods (appendix p 12).

The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. In the subset of 24 deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in mainland China early in the epidemic, with correction for bias introduced by the growth of the epidemic, we estimated the mean time from onset to death to be 18·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 15·7–49·7; figure 2) with a coefficient of variation of 0·45 (95% CrI 0·29–0·54). With the small number of observations in these data and given that they were from early in the epidemic, we could not rule out many deaths occurring with longer times from onset to death, hence the high upper limit of the credible interval. However, given that the epidemic in China has since declined, our posterior estimate of the mean time from onset to death, informed by the analysis of aggregated data from China, is more precise (mean 17·8 days [16·9–19·2]; figure 2).Figure 2Onset-to-death and onset-to-recovery distributionsShow full caption(A) Onset-to-death data from 24 cases in mainland China early in the epidemic.

Both these onset-to-outcome estimates are consistent with a separate study in China.23Zhou F Yu T Du R et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020;  (published online March 11.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3Google Scholar Case fatality ratios were estimated from aggregate data on cases and deaths in mainland China (table 1). A large proportion of the cases, including all of those early in the epidemic, were reported in Wuhan, where the local health system was quickly overwhelmed. As a result, the age distribution of cases reported in Wuhan differed to that in the rest of China (figure 3A). Reported cases in Wuhan were more frequent in older age groups, perhaps reflecting higher severity (and therefore prioritisation for hospitalisation in Wuhan), while cases outside of Wuhan might also show a bias in terms of the relationship between age and travel. Adjusting for differences in underlying demography and assuming no overall difference in the attack rate by age, we estimated high under-ascertainment of cases in younger age groups both inside and outside of Wuhan (figure 3C, D). Furthermore, we estimated a higher level of under-ascertainment overall in Wuhan compared with outside of Wuhan (figure 3C). Accounting for this under-ascertainment, we estimated the highest case fatality ratio (13·4% [11·2–15·9%]) in the 80 years and older age group (figure 3B, table 1), with lower case fatality ratios associated with lower age groups, and the lowest in the 0–9 years age group (0·00260% [0·000312–0·0382]).Table 1Estimates of case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio obtained from aggregate time series of cases in mainland ChinaDeathsLaboratory-confirmed cases** Values do not include the clinically diagnosed cases included in our estimates.Case fatality ratioInfection fatality ratio†† Obtained by combining estimates of case fatality ratios with information on infection prevalence obtained from those returning home on repatriation flights.CrudeAdjusted for censoringAdjusted for censoring, demography, and under-ascertainment‡‡ Accounts for the underlying demography in Wuhan and elsewhere in China and corrects for under-ascertainment.Overall102344 6722·29% (2·15–2·43)3·67% (3·56–3·80)1·38% (1·23–1·53)0·657% (0·389–1·33)Age group, years0–904160·000% (0·000–0·883)0·0954% (0·0110–1·34)0·00260% (0·000312–0·0382)0·00161% (0·000185–0·0249)10–1915490·182% (0·00461–1·01)0·352% (0·0663–1·74)0·0148% (0·00288–0·0759)0·00695% (0·00149–0·0502)20–29736190·193% (0·0778–0·398)0·296% (0·158–0·662)0·0600% (0·0317–0·132)0·0309% (0·0138–0·0923)30–391876000·237% (0·140–0·374)0·348% (0·241–0·577)0·146% (0·103–0·255)0·0844% (0·0408–0·185)40–493885710·443% (0·314–0·608)0·711% (0·521–0·966)0·295% (0·221–0·422)0·161% (0·0764–0·323)50–5913010 0081·30% (1·09–1·54)2·06% (1·74–2·43)1·25% (1·03–1·55)0·595% (0·344–1·28)60–6930985833·60% (3·22–4·02)5·79% (5·20–6·34)3·99% (3·41–4·55)1·93% (1·11–3·89)70–7931239187·96% (7·13–8·86)12·7% (11·5–13·9)8·61% (7·48–9·99)4·28% (2·45–8·44)≥80208140814·8% (13·0–16·7)23·3% (20·3–26·7)13·4% (11·2–15·9)7·80% (3·80–13·3)Age category (binary), years<6019430 7630·631% (0·545–0·726)1·01% (0·900–1·17)0·318% (0·274–0·378)0·145% (0·0883–0·317)≥6082913 9095·96% (5·57–6·37)9·49% (9·11–9·95)6·38% (5·70–7·17)3·28% (1·82–6·18)Crude case fatality ratios are presented as mean (95% confidence interval).

In international Wuhan residents repatriated on six flights, we estimated a prevalence of infection of 0·87% (95% CI 0·32–1·9; six of 689). Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we estimate an infection fatality ratio of 0·66% (95% CrI 0·39–1·33). As for the case fatality ratio, this is strongly age-dependent, with estimates rising steeply from age 50 years upwards (table 1). The demography-adjusted and under-ascertainment-adjusted proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation ranges from 1·1% in the 20–29 years age group up to 18·4% in those 80 years and older (table 3). Using these age-stratified infection fatality ratio estimates, we estimate the infection fatality ratio in the Diamond Princess population to be 2·9%. Given the delay from onset of symptoms to death, we would expect 97% of these deaths to have occurred by March 25, 2020, giving an estimate of the current infection fatality ratio of 2·8%, compared with the empirical estimate of 1·4% (95% CI 0·7–2·6; ten of 712).Table 3Estimates of the proportion of all infections that would lead to hospitalisation, obtained from a subset of cases reported in mainland China18Yang Y Lu Q Liu M et al.Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online Feb 21.)

From an extensive analysis of data from different regions of the world, our best estimate at the current time for the case fatality ratio of COVID-19 in China is 1·38% (95% CrI 1·23–1·53). Although this value remains lower than estimates for other coronaviruses, including SARS24Lau EHY Hsiung CA Cowling BJ et al.A comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS in Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan.BMC Infect Dis. 2010; 10: 50Google Scholar and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),25Lessler J Salje H Van Kerkhove MD et al.Estimating the severity and subclinical burden of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Am J Epidemiol. 2016; 183: 657-663Google Scholar it is substantially higher than estimates from the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.26Riley S Kwok KO Wu KM et al.Epidemiological characteristics of 2009 (H1N1) pandemic influenza based on paired sera from a longitudinal community cohort study.PLoS Med. 2011; 8e1000442Google Scholar,  27Kwok KO Riley S Perera RAPM et al.Relative incidence and individual-level severity of seasonal influenza A H3N2 compared with 2009 pandemic H1N1.BMC Infect Dis. 2017; 17: 337Google Scholar Our estimate of an infection fatality ratio of 0·66% in China was informed by PCR testing of international Wuhan residents returning on repatriation flights. This value was consistent with the infection fatality ratio observed in passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship up to March 5, 2020, although it is slightly above the upper 95% confidence limit of the age-adjusted infection fatality ratio observed by March 25 (of 712 confirmed cases, 601 have been discharged, ten have died, and 11 remain in a critical condition). This difference might be due to repatriation flight data slightly underestimating milder infections, or due to cruise passengers having better outcomes because of a potentially higher-than-average quality of health care. Our estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases require hospitalisation. This assumption is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in China, where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation. Mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations, given that the risks associated with COVID-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying comorbidities. Our estimate of the case fatality ratio is substantially lower than the crude case fatality ratio obtained from China based on the cases and deaths observed to date, which is currently 3·67%, as well as many of the estimates currently in the literature. The principle reason for this difference is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases. For example, various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms (for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history)13Jung S Akhmetzhanov AR Hayashi K et al.Real-time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: inference using exported cases.J Clin Med. 2020; 9: E523Google Scholar through to those identified in the hospital setting.14Mizumoto K Kagaya K Chowell G Yoshida-Nakaadachi-cho U Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan City: China, January–February, 2020.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 13.)

Our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20 years. As there are very few cases in this age group, it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility, although early results indicate young people are not at lower risk of infection than adults.28Bi Q Wu Y Mei S et al.Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 19.) (preprint).DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423Google Scholar Serological testing in this age group will be crucial in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age group in driving population transmission. The estimated increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case reports, in which the mean age tends to be in the range of 50–60 years. Different surveillance systems will pick up a different age case mix, and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through a history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance. Our correction for this surveillance bias therefore allows us to obtain estimates that can be applied to different case mixes and demographic population structures. However, it should be noted that this correction is applicable under the assumption of a uniform infection attack rate (ie, exposure) across the population. We also assumed perfect case ascertainment outside of Wuhan in the age group with the most cases relative to their population size (50–59-year-olds); however, if many cases were missed, the case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio estimates might be lower. In the absence of random population surveys of infection prevalence, our adjustment from case fatality ratio to infection fatality ratio relied on repatriation flight data, which was not age specific. The reported proportion of infected individuals who were asymptomatic on the Diamond Princess did not vary considerably by age, supporting this approach, but future larger representative population prevalence surveys and seroprevalence surveys will inform such estimates further. Much of the data informing global estimates of the case fatality ratio at present are from the early outbreak in Wuhan. Given that the health system in this city was quickly overwhelmed, our estimates suggest that there is substantial under-ascertainment of cases in the younger age groups (who we estimate to have milder disease) by comparison with elsewhere in mainland China. This under-ascertainment is the main factor driving the difference between our estimate of the crude case fatality ratio from China (3·67%) and our best estimate of the overall case fatality ratio (1·38%). The case fatality ratio is likely to be strongly influenced by the availability of health-care facilities. However surprisingly, although health-care availability in Wuhan was stretched, our estimates from international cases are of a similar magnitude, suggesting relatively little difference in health outcome. Finally, as clinical knowledge of this new disease accrues, it is possible that outcomes will improve. It will therefore be important to revise these estimates as epidemics unfold. The world is currently experiencing the early stages of a global pandemic. Although China has succeeded in containing the disease spread for 2 months, such containment is unlikely to be achievable in most countries. Thus, much of the world will experience very large community epidemics of COVID-19 over the coming weeks and months. Our estimates of the underlying infection fatality ratio of this virus will inform assessments of health effects likely to be experienced in different countries, and thus decisions around appropriate mitigation policies to be adopted.

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.MethodsFrom Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.FindingsCases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6).InterpretationOur data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.FundingEmergency Response Program of Harbin Institute of Technology, Emergency Response Program of Peng Cheng Laboratory, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6). Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

If well tracked, early introductions of an emerging pathogen provide a unique opportunity to characterise its transmission, natural history, and the effectiveness of screening. Careful monitoring of cases and low probability of infection from the general community enables inferences, important to modelling the course of the outbreak, that are difficult to make during a widely disseminated epidemic. In particular, we can make assumptions about when and where cases were likely to have been infected that are impossible when the pathogen is widespread. Furthermore, during these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing important information about transmission and natural history. Combined, these data on early introductions can be used to give insights into the natural history of the disease,9Lessler J Reich NG Cummings DAT Nair HP Jordan HT Thompson N Outbreak of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) at a New York City school.N Engl J Med. 2009; 361: 2628-2636CrossrefPubMedScopus (227)Google Scholar transmission characteristics,10Lipsitch M Cohen T Cooper B et al.Transmission dynamics and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome.Science. 2003; 300: 1966-1970CrossrefPubMedScopus (652)Google Scholar and the unseen burden of infection.11Lessler J Salje H Van Kerkhove MD et al.Estimating the severity and subclinical burden of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Am J Epidemiol. 2016; 183: 657-663CrossrefPubMedScopus (19)Google Scholar Research in contextEvidence before this studyThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been accompanied by a substantial increase in research and publications ranging from transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 to clinical characteristics of the infection.

We present one of the first estimates of the serial interval, secondary household attack rate, and dispersion (ie, tendency towards super spreading) for SARS-CoV-2 based on active surveillance data. We found that the attack rate does not differ significantly by age, with on average 7% of close contacts becoming infected, around 80% of these contacts showing any symptoms, and 3% of infections manifesting severe disease at initial assessment.

We provide a key piece of evidence supporting intensive contact tracing and highlighting that children might be an important target for interventions aimed at reducing transmission, even if they do not get sick. Here, we use data collected by the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Shenzhen CDC) on 391 cases of COVID-19 and 1286 of their close contacts to characterise key aspects of its epidemiology outside of Hubei province. We characterise differences in demographics and severity between cases identified through symptom-based surveillance and monitoring of close case contacts, and estimate the time to key events, such as confirmation, isolation, and recovery. Using data from contact tracing, we characterise SARS-CoV-2 transmission by estimating key values, such as the household secondary attack rate, serial interval, and observed reproductive number (R). On Jan 8, 2020, Shenzhen CDC identified the first case of pneumonia with unknown cause and began monitoring travellers from Hubei province for symptoms of COVID-19. Over the next 2 weeks this surveillance programme expanded to include travellers from Hubei regardless of symptoms, patients at local hospitals, and individuals detected by fever screening in neighbourhoods and at local clinics. Suspected cases and close contacts were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of nasal swabs at 28 qualified local hospitals, ten district-level CDCs, and two third-party testing organisations, with final confirmation done at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangdong CDC) or Shenzhen CDC (appendix 2 p 11). Close contacts were identified through contact tracing of a confirmed case and were defined as those who lived in the same apartment, shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with an index case 2 days before symptom onset. Casual contacts (eg, other clinic patients) and some close contacts (eg, nurses) who wore a mask during exposure were not included in this group. Symptomatic cases were isolated and treated at designated hospitals regardless of RT-PCR test results. Asymptomatic individuals who tested positive were quarantined at centralised facilities. Close contacts and travellers from Hubei who tested negative were quarantined at home or a central facility, and monitored for 14 days. RT-PCR testing was required for all close contacts at the beginning of isolation, and release was conditional on a negative RT-PCR result. Basic demographics, signs and symptoms, clinical severity, and exposure history were recorded for all confirmed cases. Here, we analyse confirmed cases identified by the Shenzhen CDC between Jan 14 and Feb 12, 2020, and close contacts of cases confirmed before Feb 9, 2020. This work was done in support of an ongoing public health response, and hence was determined not to be human subjects research after consultation with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health institutional review board. Data collection is part of the continuing public health investigation of an emerging outbreak and therefore the individual informed consent was waived. The study was approved by the ethics committees of Shenzhen CDC. Analytical datasets were constructed in an anonymised manner, and all analysis of personally identifiable data took place onsite at the Shenzhen CDC. We defined symptom-based surveillance to include symptomatic screening at airport and train stations, community fever monitoring, home observation of recent travellers to Hubei, and testing of patients admitted to hospital. Contact-based surveillance is the identification of cases through monitoring and testing of close contacts of confirmed cases, independently of their symptom presentation. By protocol, those in the contact-based group were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of symptoms, whereas those in the other categories were tested only if they showed signs or symptoms of disease. At the first clinical assessment, data were recorded on 21 signs and symptoms (appendix 2 p 1), and disease severity was assessed. Cases with fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia were classified as having moderate symptoms. Cases were classified as having severe symptoms if they had any of the following: breathing rate 30 breaths per min or higher; oxygen saturation level 93% or lower at rest; oxygen concentration level PaO2/FiO2 (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen) 300 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0·133 kPa) or lower; lung infiltrates higher than 50% within 24–48 h; respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; septic shock; or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. All other symptomatic cases were classified as mild. Relationships between demographics, mode of detection, and symptom severity were assessed and characterised with χ2 tests, and simple and multiple logistic regression. Distributions were fit to the timing of key events in each confirmed case's course of infection and treatment. The time from infection to symptom onset (incubation period) was assumed to be log-normally distributed and estimated as previously described.12Reich NG Lessler J Azman A Kamvar ZN Analysis of coarsely observed data [R package coarseDataTools version 0·6–5].

Cases who recently travelled to Hubei were assumed to have been exposed while there. Cases without a recent travel history but with exposure to a confirmed case were assumed to be exposed from the time of earliest to latest possible contact with that case. Only cases for whom we could identify the earliest and latest possible time of exposure and who had a date of symptom onset were included in the analysis. Time between symptom onset and recovery was estimated by use of parametric survival methods. Patients who had not recovered were considered to be censored on Feb 22, 2020, or at the time of death. All other delay distributions were estimated by directly fitting parametric distributions to time between symptom onset or arrival in Shenzhen, and confirmation, isolation, or admission to hospital. Confidence intervals were calculated with bootstrapping or standard parametric estimators.15Efron B Gong G A leisurely look at the bootstrap, the jackknife, and cross-validation.Am Stat. 1983; 37: 36-48Google Scholar Transmission was characterised by examining the relationship between confirmed cases and their infected and uninfected close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was calculated as the percentage of household contacts (those sharing a room, apartment, or other sleeping arrangement) who were later confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The distribution of serial intervals (the time between symptom onset in the confirmed case and their infected contacts) was calculated by fitting parametric distributions to the time of symptom onset in clear case–contact pairs. The mean R and distribution of individual reproductive numbers (ie, the number of secondary infections caused by each case) were calculated from the number of secondary infections observed among close contacts of each index case, with ambiguities resolved through multiple imputation (appendix 2 p 11). The relative odds of transmission among contacts of various types were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression and random-effects models, to account for differing numbers of possible infected individuals in each risk group. When assessing the impact of characteristics of infected individuals, we only included risk sets where a single potential infected individual was clearly identifiable. Confidence intervals were estimated by use of bootstrapping or standard parametric approaches. The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Shenzhen CDC had full access to all the data in the study, and all corresponding authors share the final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Between Jan 14 and Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen CDC confirmed 391 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (table 1). Of 379 with a known mode of detection, 292 (77%) were detected through symptom-based surveillance. Overall, there were approximately equal numbers of male and female cases (187 vs 204). The mean age of the population was 45 years, and 307 (79%) of 391 cases were adults aged 30–69 years. At the time of first clinical assessment, most cases were mild (102 [26%] of 391) or moderate (254 [65%] of 391), and only 35 (9%) were severe. 330 (84%) of 391 cases had fever at the time of initial assessment, while 25 (6%) of 391 had no signs or symptoms. As of Feb 22, 2020, final clinical outcomes were known for 228 of 391 cases in our data, with three who had died (all captured through symptom-based surveillance) and 225 who had recovered.Table 1Demographic and clinical characteristics of cases by contact-based versus symptom-based surveillanceContact-based surveillance (n=87)Symptom-based surveillance (n=292)Unknown or other (n=12)Total (n=391)p valueSexFemale63 (72%)131 (45%)10 (83%)204 (52%)<0·0001Male24 (28%)161 (55%)2 (17%)187 (48%)..Age0–9 years13 (15%)6 (2%)1 (8%)20 (5%)<0·000110–19 years5 (6%)6 (2%)1 (8%)12 (3%)..20–29 years11 (13%)23 (8%)0 (0%)34 (9%)..30–39 years15 (17%)71 (24%)1 (8%)87 (22%)..40–49 years9 (10%)49 (17%)2 (17%)60 (15%)..50–59 years10 (12%)63 (22%)1 (8%)74 (19%)..60–69 years20 (23%)60 (21%)6 (50%)86 (22%)..≥70 years4 (5%)14 (5%)0 (0%)18 (5%)..SeverityMild18 (21%)82 (28%)2 (17%)102 (26%)0·03Moderate66 (76%)180 (62%)8 (67%)254 (65%)..Severe3 (3%)30 (10%)2 (17%)35 (9%)..SymptomaticNo17 (20%)8 (3%)0 (0%)25 (6%)<0·0001Yes70 (80%)284 (97%)12 (100%)366 (94%)..FeverNo25 (29%)34 (12%)2 (17%)61 (16%)0·0002Yes62 (71%)258 (88%)10 (83%)330 (84%)..

The probability of severe symptoms increased slightly with age, although only individuals aged 60–69 years had a significantly increased risk compared with the reference category, individuals aged 50–59 years (OR 3·4 [95% 1·4–9·5]). Based on 183 cases with a well defined period of exposure and symptom onset (appendix 2 p 8), we estimated the median incubation period for COVID-19 to be 4·8 days (95% CI 4·2–5·4; figure 1, appendix 2 p 2), and estimated that 95% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 14·0 days (95% CI 12·2–15·9) of infection. We estimated that about 5·0% of cases who develop symptoms would not show symptoms until 14 days after infection.Figure 1Incubation period and serial interval of COVID-19Show full caption(A) Proportion of cases who developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by days after infection (ie, the cumulative distribution function of the incubation period).

We estimated that the median serial interval of COVID-19 is 5·4 days (95% CI 4·4–6·5). 5% of infected cases who develop symptoms will do so by 1·3 days (95% CI 0·9–1·9) after symptom onset of the index case, and 95% by 14·3 days (11·1–17·6). Based on 228 cases with known outcomes, we estimated that median time to recovery was 20·8 days (95% CI 20·1–21·5). We estimated that the median time to recovery was 22·4 days (95% CI 20·8–24·1) in individuals aged 50–59 years, and was estimated to be significantly shorter in younger adults (eg, 19·2 days in individuals aged 20–29 years; appendix 2 pp 3, 10). In multiple regression models including sex, age, baseline severity, and method of detection, in addition to age, baseline severity was associated with time to recovery (appendix 2 p 3). Compared to cases with mild symptoms, those with severe symptoms had a 41% (95% CI 24–60) longer time to recovery (appendix 2 p 3). As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died. These deaths occurred 35–44 days from symptom onset and 27–33 days from confirmation. Cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were confirmed on average 5·5 days (95% CI 5·0–5·9) after symptom onset (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2), whereas those detected by contact-based surveillance were confirmed on average 3·2 days (95% CI 2·7–3·8) after symptom onset. 17 (5%) of 342 cases with a known onset date and start date of quarantine were isolated before developing symptoms. Among those isolated after developing symptoms, the symptom-based surveillance group was, on average, isolated 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after symptom onset, whereas the contact-based surveillance group was isolated 2·7 days (2·1–3·3) after symptom onset. Hence, contact-based surveillance was associated with a 2·3-day (95% CI 1·5–3·0) decrease in time to confirmation and a 1·9-day (1·1–2·7) decrease in time to isolation. The mean time between symptom onset and admission to hospital was similar to time between symptom onset and isolation in both the symptom-based and contact-based surveillance groups (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2).Figure 2Time between symptom onset and SARS-CoV-2 confirmation (A), admission to hospital (B), and isolation among cases (C) detected by contact-based and symptom-based surveillanceShow full captionThe maximum-likelihood estimates for the parametric distribution of the cumulative distribution function are shown, along with 1000 parametric bootstrap estimates of the cumulative distribution function. Panel A shows estimates of the proportion of cases who are confirmed by RT-PCR, according to the number of days after symptom onset.

Those developing symptoms before arrival or on the day of arrival were confirmed as cases on average 4·5 days (95% CI 3·8–5·1) after arrival, and isolated on average 3·1 days (2·5–3·7) after arrival. Overall, 1286 close contacts were identified for index cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 14 and Feb 9, 2020, with 244 (84%) of 292 cases having at least one close contact. 622 (95%) of 653 close contacts with known dates for the period when they were under quarantine were followed up for 12 days or longer. 98 of the close contacts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, and one had presumptive infection. Assuming those with a missing test result were uninfected, we found that the secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8) among household contacts and 6·6% (5·4–8·1) overall (the secondary attack rate increased to 14·9% [12·1–18·2] among household contacts and 9·7% [7·9–11·8] overall if those with missing results were removed from the denominator). In multiple conditional logistic regression analysis of contact types, household contact (OR 6·3; 95% CI 1·5–26·3) and travelling together (OR 7·1; 1·4–34·9) were significantly associated with infection (table 3). Reporting contact that occurred often was also associated with increased risk of infection compared with moderate-frequency contact (OR 8·8; 95% CI 2·6–30·1; table 3).Table 3Group-specific attack rates and risk factors for SAR-CoV-2 infection among close contactsNumber of cases** 15 confirmed close contacts were excluded from this analysis because contact tracing reports for the negative close contacts in the same clusters were missing.

Attack rates were similar across all age categories of infected contacts (table 3), although we observed some indication of elevated attack rates in older age groups (figure 3). Notably, the rate of infection in children younger than 10 years (7·4%) was similar to the population average (6·6%). There was no significant association between probability of infection and age of the index case. Surprisingly, in univariate analysis a longer time in the community before isolation was associated with a reduced risk of causing infections (data not shown). However, this association was no longer significant after adjusting for contact frequency and type.Figure 3Attack rate among close contacts, baseline severity, and proportion of cases without fever at initial assessment by age groupShow full caption*Proportion of close contacts for attack rate; proportion of all cases for those with severe symptoms or no fever at initial assessment.View Large                                            Image                                        Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res                                            image                                        Download (PPT) *Proportion of close contacts for attack rate; proportion of all cases for those with severe symptoms or no fever at initial assessment. Based on 48 pairs of cases with a clear relationship between the index case and secondary case and time of symptom onset, we estimated that the serial interval is gamma distributed with a mean of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6) and an SD of 4·2 days (95% CI 3·1–5·3; figure 1B, appendix 2 p 2). Hence, 95% of secondary cases were expected to develop symptoms within 14·3 days (95% CI 11·1–17·6) of their infector. This estimate includes the effect of isolation on truncating the serial interval. Stratified results show that if the infected individual was isolated less than 3 days after infection the average serial interval was 3·6 days, increasing to 8·1 days if the infected individual was isolated on the third day after symptom onset or later (appendix 2 p 3). The mean number of secondary cases caused by each index case (ie, the observed reproductive number, R), was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5). The distribution of individual R values was highly over-dispersed, with 80% of infections being caused by 8·9% (95% CI 3·5–10·8) of cases (negative binomial dispersion parameter 0·58; 95% CI 0·35–1·18). We examined the potential impact of surveillance and isolation through truncating the infectious period. Because of the scarce understanding of infectious periods following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we considered a range of possible infectious periods where infectiousness varies over time and follows a gamma distribution (appendix 2 p 11). We defined the mean infectious day (ie, the average number of days after symptom onset that an infected individual is expected to infect a secondary case) as the weighted mean of the infectious period, where each day is weighted by relative infectiousness. We considered periods where the mean infectious day is less than 15 days after symptom onset (roughly the period of SARS and early SARS-CoV-2 reports),16Peiris JSM Chu CM Cheng VCC et al.Clinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1767-1772SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (1025)Google Scholar,  17Zou L Ruan F Huang M et al.SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 1177-1179CrossrefPubMedScopus (129)Google Scholar and assumed that R0=2·6 and that isolation effectively ends the infectious period. Under these assumptions we found that if the mean infectious day is greater than 5 days, then it might be possible to bring R below one in cases detected by symptom-based surveillance, and the same can be accomplished by contact-based surveillance if the mean infectious day is greater than 3 days (appendix 2 p 9). For the impact of passive surveillance alone to achieve our observed R of 0·4, we projected that the mean infectious day must be at least 5·5 days (and likely greater) after symptom onset. Even if transmission is completely eliminated in the group captured by surveillance (eg, if we could get perfect surveillance on the day of symptom onset), assuming R0=2·6, the cases captured by surveillance must, if not isolated, be expected to cause 61% of onward transmission to achieve local elimination by surveillance and isolation alone (appendix 2 p 9). This analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 cases and their close contacts in Shenzhen, China, provides insight into the natural history, transmission, and control of this disease. The values estimated provide the evidentiary foundation for predicting the impact of this virus, evaluating control measures, and guiding the global response. Analyses of how cases are detected, and use of data on individuals exposed but not infected, indicate that infection rates in young children are not lower than the population average (even if rates of clinical disease are). We were able to directly estimate important transmission parameters, and show that, at least among observed contacts, transmission rates are low. Estimates of the distribution of time between symptom onset and case isolation by surveillance type reveal that heightened surveillance combined with case isolation could plausibly account for these low rates of transmission. These results paint a positive picture of the impact of heightened surveillance and isolation in Shenzhen. However, uncertainty in the number of asymptomatic cases missed by surveillance and their ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 must temper any hopes of stopping the COVID-19 pandemic by these measures. This work further supports the understanding of COVID-19 as a disease with a fairly short incubation period (mean 4–6 days) but a long clinical course,2Chen N Zhou M Dong X et al.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 507-513SummaryFull TextFull Text PDFPubMedScopus (559)Google Scholar,  7Backer JA Klinkenberg D Wallinga J Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20–28 January 2020.Euro Surveill. 2020; 252000062CrossrefScopus (49)Google Scholar,  18Pan F Ye T Sun P et al.Time course of lung changes on chest CT during recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia.Radiology. 2020;  (published online Feb 13.)DOI:10.1148/radiol.2020200370CrossrefPubMedGoogle Scholar with patients taking many weeks to die or recover. Notably, however, we estimate a higher proportion of cases taking 14 days or more to develop symptoms (5%) than estimated in the study by Lauer and colleagues (1%).6Lauer SA Grantz KH Bi Q et al.The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application.Ann Int Med. 2020;  (published online March 10)DOI: 10.7326/M20-0504CrossrefPubMedScopus (56)Google Scholar Focusing on cases detected through contact-based surveillance adds nuance to previous characterisations of COVID-19. Since RT-PCR testing of contacts is near universal, we can assume these cases are more reflective of the average SARS-CoV-2 infection than cases detected through symptomatic surveillance. In the contact-based surveillance group, any tendency for cases to be male or older (beyond the underlying population distribution) disappears. Furthermore, in this group, 20% of cases were asymptomatic at the time of first clinical assessment and nearly 30% did not have a fever. This observation is consistent with a reasonably high rate of asymptomatic carriage, but lower than that suggested by some modelling studies,19Imai N Cori A Dorigatti I Baguelin M Donnelly CA Riley S Ferguson NM Report 3: transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-transmissibility-25-01-2020.pdfDate: Jan 25, 2020Date accessed: February 24, 2020Google Scholar although RT-PCR has imperfect sensitivity.20Fang Y Zhang H Xie J et al.Sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19: comparison to RT-PCR.Radiology. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1148/radiol.2020200432CrossrefGoogle Scholar In Shenzhen, SARS-CoV-2 transmission most probably occurred between very close contacts, such as individuals sharing a household. However, even in this group fewer than one in six contacts (ie, secondary attack rate 11–15%) were infected, and overall we observed far fewer than one (0·4) onward transmission per primary case. As noted above, low transmission levels might in part be due to the impact of isolation and surveillance, but it is equally likely that unobserved transmission has some role. We also estimated reasonably high rates of overdispersion in the number of cases caused by each infected individual, leaving open the possibility that large COVID-19 clusters can occur even if surveillance and isolation are forcing R below one—events that could potentially overwhelm the surveillance system. This work has numerous limitations. As in any active outbreak response, the data were collected by multiple teams under protocols that, by necessity, changed as the situation developed. Hence, there might be noise and inconsistency in definitions. Notably, the definition of a confirmed case changed to require symptoms near the end of our analysis period (Feb 7), but sensitivity analyses show that truncating the data at this point does not qualitatively influence results (appendix 2 pp 5–6). It is, likewise, impossible to identify every potential contact an individual has, so contact tracing focuses on those close contacts who are most likely to be infected; hence our R is assuredly lower than the true reproductive number in the population. Asymptomatic travellers will be missed by symptom-based surveillance and, even if they are tested, some asymptomatic contacts might be missed because of the imperfect sensitivity of the RT-PCR test.20Fang Y Zhang H Xie J et al.Sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19: comparison to RT-PCR.Radiology. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1148/radiol.2020200432CrossrefGoogle Scholar Recovery time in Shenzhen is likely to be inflated because cases are required to be isolated for 2 weeks and release is conditional on a negative RT-PCR test. Although guidelines for contact tracing and case detection are supposed to be implemented across the country, whether the impact of contact tracing can be generalised to other parts of China depends on a range of factors, including local testing capacity and surveillance resources. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, it is important that we continue to expand our knowledge about its transmission and natural history. Data from the early phase of local outbreaks, when detailed contact tracing is possible and sources of infection can still be reliably inferred, are particularly powerful for estimating critical values pertinent to describing transmission and the natural history of a disease. This is especially true when information about uninfected contacts and mode of detection is used, as we have done here. The resulting estimates provide important inputs for interpreting surveillance data, evaluating interventions, and setting public health policy. This online publication has been corrected.

As of April 22, India has reported 18 985 confirmed cases and 603 deaths from COVID-19 in 31 states and union territories since its first case on Jan 30. India was quick to close its international borders and enforce an immediate lockdown, which WHO praised as “tough and timely”. The lockdown has also given the government time to prepare for a possible surge in cases when the pandemic is forecasted to peak in the coming weeks. Still, India's population of 1·3 billion across diverse states, health inequalities, widening economic and social disparities, and distinct cultural values present unique challenges. Preparedness and response to COVID-19 have differed at the state level. Kerala has drawn on its experience with the Nipah virus in 2018 to use extensive testing, contact tracing, and community mobilisation to contain the virus and maintain a very low mortality rate. It has also set up thousands of temporary shelters for migrant workers. Odisha's exposure to previous natural disasters meant crisis precautions were already in place and have been repurposed. Maharashtra has used drones to monitor physical distancing during lockdown and applied a cluster containment strategy: if three or more patients are diagnosed, all houses within 3 km are surveyed to detect further cases, trace contacts, and raise awareness. Whether this strategy will be successful is still unclear. The premise relies on there not being community transmission, and there is danger of stigmatisation and coercion. But states deserve much of the credit for India's COVID-19 response. The government's sudden enforcement of the lockdown seemed hastily prepared and immediately disadvantaged already vulnerable populations. There has been a mass exodus of migrant workers and concerns are rising about starvation among people who work in the informal economy. Implementing public health measures is difficult in places with overcrowded living conditions and inadequate hygiene and sanitation. Non-COVID-19 health services have been disrupted. Reports suggest that the government's efforts to provide financial support and a measure of food security to ease these pressures will be insufficient to meet demand. But better planning and communication could have helped avert this crisis. Rates of testing have been low (0·28 per 1000 people as of April 20). Capacity issues, absence of political will, and operational feasibility have been to blame. However, efforts to reverse the situation are underway as hundreds of thousands of testing kits have become available, and more testing companies and laboratories have been approved. Testing needs to be expanded exponentially as well as strategically as a tool to provide epidemiological evidence. India's response has also been constrained by a shortage of health workers, but this should be remedied by new reforms that would mobilise additional health-care workers from different sources. One threat to the COVID-19 response in India is the spread of misinformation driven by fear, stigma, and blame. There have been rising levels of violence against health-care workers and stigmatisation of people with or suspected of having COVID-19, which could impede reporting of illness. The pandemic has also been used to fan anti-Muslim sentiment and violence, after a gathering connected to the group Tablighi Jamaat was identified as being responsible for many cases. A welcome initiative to combat fake news is being led by a group of more than 400 multidisciplinary Indian scientists, who have voluntarily formed Indian Scientists' Response to COVID-19 to fight myths and misinformation about the disease. In India's favour are its young population (65% aged <35 years) and, to date, a less severe pandemic than was feared. The lockdown is already having the desired effect of flattening the epidemic curve. From April 20, states began easing restrictions on the basis of district profiling of infection hotspots (a form of cluster containment). The immediate challenge is to keep infections at manageable levels and ensure the ability to test, trace contacts, isolate patients, implement COVID care plans, and disseminate timely information. The central government should loosen its control and give states more autonomy over their funding and decision making. India must also pay much greater attention to the health sector and recognise the importance of having strong public sector capacity, especially in primary care and at the district level. India's public health-care system is chronically underfunded (at just 1·28% of GDP), leaving primary care weak. This pandemic could be the much needed wake-up call to the necessity of long-term changes to India's health system.

Policy makers are increasingly pressed to articulate their rationales and strategies for moving out of lockdown; the process of re-emergence is already cautiously starting in Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Wuhan, and some US states. As the counterpoise between further disease spread and socioeconomic costs is debated, it is essential that policy makers in all affected countries have the best possible data and understanding to inform any course of action. Strategies in various countries that aim to stagger return to work on the basis of disease severity risk and age do not take account of how exposing even lower-risk individuals, such as young people with no comorbidities, to the virus so as to increase herd immunity can still result in pandemic spread. The only selective pressure on SARS-CoV-2 is transmission—stop transmission and you stop the virus. The linchpin for a strategy to move out of lockdown seemingly rests on increased testing and contact tracing, possible return-to-work permits based on immune status,1Studdert DM Hall MA Disease control, civil liberties, and mass testing—calibrating restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMp2007637Google Scholar repurposed or new therapeutics,2Martinez MA Compounds with therapeutic potential against novel respiratory 2019 coronavirus.Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2020; 64: e00399-e00420Google Scholar and, finally, vaccination.3Amanat F Krammer F SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: status report.Immunity. 2020; 52: 583-589Google Scholar,  4Thanh Le T Andreadakis Z Kumar A et al.The COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5Google Scholar This approach is broadly sensible, yet immunology is a complex branch of molecular medicine and policy makers need to be alerted to important aspects of immunology in relation to COVID-19. There is no certainty as to the immunological correlates of antiviral protection or the proportion of the population who must attain them, making it impossible to identify a point when this level of immunity has been reached. Current discussion, for example, addresses the notion that scaled up antibody testing will determine who is immune, thus giving an indication of the extent of herd immunity and confirming who could re-enter the workforce. There are questions to be addressed about the accuracy of tests and practicalities of implementation of laboratory-based versus home-use assays.5Adams ER Anand R Andersson M et al.Evaluation of antibody testing for SARS-Cov-2 using ELISA and lateral flow immunoassays.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 20.) (preprint)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066407Google Scholar For any country contemplating these issues, another crucial question is how solid is the assumption that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein equate to functional protection? Furthermore, if presence of these antibodies is protective, how can it be decided what proportion of the population requires these antibodies to mitigate subsequent waves of cases of COVID-19? Any discussions should be informed by consideration of correlates of protection. Initially proposed by Stanley Plotkin,6Plotkin SA Vaccination against the major infectious diseases.CR Acad Sci III. 1999; 322: 943-951Google Scholar,  7Plotkin SA Immunologic correlates of protection induced by vaccination.Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2001; 20: 63-75Google Scholar this concept rests on the notion of empirically defined, quantifiable immune parameters that determine the attainment of protection against a given pathogen. Caution is needed because total measurable antibody is not precisely the same as protective, virus-neutralising antibody. Furthermore, studies in COVID-19 show that 10–20% of symptomatically infected people have little or no detectable antibody.8Tan W Lu Y Zhang J et al.Viral kinetics and antibody responses in patients with COVID-19.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 26.) (preprint)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382Google Scholar In some cases of COVID-19, low virus-binding antibody titres might correlate with lethal or near-lethal infection, or with having had a mild infection with little antigenic stimulation. Importantly, scientists must not only identify correlates of protection but also have a robust understanding of the correlates of progression to severe COVID-19, since knowledge of the latter will inform the former. The route to certainty on the degree and nature of the immunity required for protection will require evidence from formal proofs using approaches such as titrated transfers of antibodies and T lymphocytes to define protection in non-human primate models, as used, for example, in studies of Ebola virus.9Stanley DA Honko AN Asiedu C et al.Chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine generates acute and durable protective immunity against ebolavirus challenge.Nat Med. 2014; 20: 1126-1129Google Scholar A study of survivors of SARS showed that about 90% had functional, virus-neutralising antibodies and around 50% had strong T-lymphocyte responses.10Li CK Wu H Yan H et al.T cell responses to whole SARS coronavirus in humans.J Immunol. 2008; 181: 5490-5500Google Scholar These observations bolster confidence in a simple view that most survivors of severe COVID-19 would be expected to have protective antibodies. A caveat is that most studies, either of SARS survivors or of COVID-19 patients, have focused on people who were hospitalised and had severe, symptomatic disease. Similar data are urgently needed for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have not been hospitalised. How long is immunity to COVID-19 likely to last? The best estimate comes from the closely related coronaviruses and suggests that, in people who had an antibody response, immunity might wane, but is detectable beyond 1 year after hospitalisation.10Li CK Wu H Yan H et al.T cell responses to whole SARS coronavirus in humans.J Immunol. 2008; 181: 5490-5500Google Scholar,  11Temperton NJ Chan PK Simmons G et al.Longitudinally profiling neutralizing antibody response to SARS coronavirus with pseudotypes.Emerg Infect Dis. 2005; 11: 411-416Google Scholar,  12Choe PG Perera RAPM Park WB et al.MERS-CoV antibody responses 1 year after symptom onset, South Korea, 2015.Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23: 1079-1084Google Scholar Obviously, longitudinal studies with a duration of just over 1 year are of little reassurance given the possibility that there could be another wave of COVID-19 cases in 3 or 4 years. Specific T-lymphocyte immunity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, however, can be detectable for 4 years, considerably longer than antibody responses.13Channappanavar R Zhao J Perlman S T cell-mediated immune response to respiratory coronaviruses.Immunol Res. 2014; 59: 118-128Google Scholar Some of the uncertainty about COVID-19 protective immunity could be addressed by monitoring the frequency of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. Anecdotal reports of reinfection from China and South Korea should be regarded with caution because some individuals who seemed to have cleared SARS-CoV-2 infection and tested negative on PCR might nevertheless have harboured persistent virus. Virus sequencing studies will help to resolve this issue and in cases of confirmed reinfection it will be important to understand if reinfection correlates with lower immunity. Policy briefings in the UK and other countries have rightly emphasised the imperative to collect seroprevalence data.14Department of Health and Social Care, UK GovernmentGovernment begins large-scale virus infection and antibody test study.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-begins-large-scale-virus-infection-and-antibody-test-studyDate: April 23, 2020Date accessed: April 24, 2020Google Scholar This approach has sometimes been construed in a narrow sense as testing that would allow people back to work. However, seroprevalence data can show what proportion of a population has been exposed to and is potentially immune to the virus, and is thus wholly distinct from the snapshot of people who accessed PCR testing. How can one determine how much herd immunity is sufficient to mitigate subsequent substantial outbreaks of COVID-19? This calculation depends on several variables,15Anderson RM May RM Vaccination and herd immunity to infectious diseases.Nature. 1985; 318: 323-329Google Scholar including the calculated basic reproduction number (R0), currently believed to be about 2·2 for SARS-CoV-2.16Li Q Guan X Wu P et al.Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 1199-1207Google Scholar On the basis of this estimated R0, the herd immunity calculation suggests that at least 60% of the population would need to have protective immunity, either from natural infection or vaccination.17Guerra FM Bolotin S Lim G et al.The basic reproduction number (RO) of measles: a systematic review.Lancet Infect Dis. 2017; 17: e420-e428Google Scholar This percentage increases if R0 has been underestimated. Most of the available COVID-19 serology data derive from people who have been hospitalised with severe infection.8Tan W Lu Y Zhang J et al.Viral kinetics and antibody responses in patients with COVID-19.medRxiv. 2020;  (published online March 26.) (preprint)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382Google Scholar,  18Wu F Wang A Liu M et al.Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 20.)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365Google Scholar In this group, around 90% develop IgG antibodies within the first 2 weeks of symptomatic infection and this appearance coincides with disappearance of virus,18Wu F Wang A Liu M et al.Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications.bioRxiv. 2020;  (published online April 20.)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365Google Scholar supporting a causal relationship between these events. However, a key question concerns antibodies in non-hospitalised individuals who either have milder disease or no symptoms. Anecdotal results from community samples yield estimates of under 10% of tested “controls” developing specific IgG antibodies. We await larger seroprevalence datasets, but it seems likely that natural exposure during this pandemic might, in the short to medium term, not deliver the required level of herd immunity and there will be a substantial need for mass vaccination programmes. There are more than 100 candidate COVID-19 vaccines in development, with a handful in, or soon to be in, phase 1 trials to assess safety and immunogenicity.4Thanh Le T Andreadakis Z Kumar A et al.The COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5Google Scholar Candidate vaccines encompass diverse platforms that differ in the potency with which immunity is stimulated, the specific arsenal of immune mediators mobilised, the number of required boosts, durability of protection, and tractability of production and supply chains.3Amanat F Krammer F SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: status report.Immunity. 2020; 52: 583-589Google Scholar,  4Thanh Le T Andreadakis Z Kumar A et al.The COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5Google Scholar Safety evaluation of candidate COVID-19 vaccines will need to be of the highest rigour. Some features of the immune response induced by infection, such as high concentrations of tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 6, which could be elicited by some candidate vaccines, have been identified as biomarkers of severe outcome.19Feldmann M Maini RN Woody JN et al.Trials of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy for COVID-19 are urgently needed.Lancet. 2020;  (published online April 9.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30858-8Google Scholar Researchers should be commended for decades of iterative efforts, bringing us to a point where there are many candidate vaccines in development against a novel virus first sequenced in January, 2020. Delivery of efficacious vaccines is not a competitive race to the finish, but a considered evaluation of a safe, potent, global response.4Thanh Le T Andreadakis Z Kumar A et al.The COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020;  (published online April 9.)DOI:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5Google Scholar Few would disagree that science should guide the clinical therapeutic approach to an infected person. Science must also guide policy decisions. Reliance on comprehensive seroprevalence data and a solid, research-based grasp of correlates of protection will allow policy to be guided by secure, evidence-based assumptions on herd immunity, rather than optimistic guesses.

In December, 2019, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, became the centre of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause.

Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future. This retrospective cohort study included two cohorts of adult inpatients (≥18 years old) from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China). All adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were screened, and those who died or were discharged between Dec 29, 2019 (ie, when the first patients were admitted), and Jan 31, 2020, were included in our study. Since these two hospitals were the only designated hospitals for transfer of patients with COVID-19 from other hospitals in Wuhan until Feb 1, 2020, our study enrolled all adult inpatients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and had a definite outcome (dead or discharged) at the early stage of the outbreak. Before Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results were not available in the electronic medical records, from which data for this study were obtained retrospectively; therefore, this study includes 29 of the 41 patients originally reported on.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar The study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of Jinyintan Hospital (KY-2020–01.01) and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission as described previously.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardised data collection form, which was a modified version of the WHO/International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case record form for severe acute respiratory infections. All data were checked by two physicians (FZ and ZL) and a third researcher (GF) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers. Methods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described elsewhere.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Briefly, four institutions—the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences—were responsible for SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. From Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health institutions, and Jingyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Throat-swab specimens were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 PCR re-examination every other day after clinical remission of symptoms, including fever, cough, and dyspnoea, but only qualitative data were available. The criteria for discharge were absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs in chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained at least 24 h apart. Routine blood examinations were complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), myocardial enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin, and procalcitonin. Chest radiographs or CT scan were also done for all inpatients. Frequency of examinations was determined by the treating physician. Fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37·3°C. Sepsis and septic shock were defined according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Secondary infection was diagnosed when patients showed clinical symptoms or signs of pneumonia or bacteraemia and a positive culture of a new pathogen was obtained from lower respiratory tract specimens (qualified sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) or blood samples after admission.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar Ventilator-associated pneumonia was diagnosed according to the guidelines for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia.8Kalil AC Metersky ML Klompas M et al.Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society.Clin Infect Dis. 2016; 63: e61-e111Google Scholar Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines9Khwaja A KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury.Nephron Clin Pract. 2012; 120: c179-c184Google Scholar and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition.10Ranieri VM Rubenfeld GD Thompson BT et al.Acute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin Definition.JAMA. 2012; 307: 2526-2533Google Scholar Acute cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or if new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar The illness severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0).11National Health Commission of the People's Republic of ChinaChinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0).http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202002/8334a8326dd94d329df351d7da8aefc2/files/b218cfeb1bc54639af227f922bf6b817.pdfDate: Feb 19, 2020Google Scholar Coagulopathy was defined as a 3-second extension of prothrombin time or a 5-second extension of activated partial thromboplastin time. Hypoproteinaemia was defined as blood albumin of less than 25 g/L. Exposure history was defined as exposure to people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the Wuhan seafood market. Continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%), respectively. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, χ2 test, or Fisher's exact test to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Considering the total number of deaths (n=54) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings and clinical constraints. Previous studies have shown blood levels of d-dimer and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to be higher in critically ill or fatal cases, whereas lymphopenia and cardiovascular disease have been less commonly observed in non-critical or surviving patients with SARS-COV-2 infection.5Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Google Scholar,  6Wang D Hu B Hu C et al.Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.JAMA. 2020;  (published online Feb 7.)DOI:10.1001/jama.2020.1585Google Scholar,  12Yang X Yu Y Xu J et al.Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study.Lancet Respir Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 24)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5Google Scholar Similar risk factors, including older age, have been reported associated with adverse clinical outcomes in adults with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).3Chan JWM Ng CK Chan YH et al.Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).Thorax. 2003; 58: 686-689Google Scholar,  13Arabi YM Balkhy HH Hayden FG et al.Middle East respiratory syndrome.N Engl J Med. 2017; 376: 584-594Google Scholar Some laboratory findings, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, and IL-6, might be unavailable in emergency circumstances. Therefore, we chose lymphocyte count, d-dimer, SOFA score, coronary heart disease, and age as the five variables for our multivariable logistic regression model. We excluded variables from the univariable analysis if their between-group differences were not significant, if their accuracy was unconfirmed (eg, exposure, which was self-reported), if the number of events was too small to calculate odds ratios, and if they had colinearity with the SOFA score. We compared patient characteristics between the two hospitals and used a generalised linear model to adjust for possible differences in patients’ characteristics and treatment between the two study centres. A two-sided α of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software (version 9.4), unless otherwise indicated. The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors (BC and HC) had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 813 adult patients were hospitalised in Jinyintan Hospital or Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital with COVID-19 before Jan 31, 2020. After excluding 613 patients that were still hospitalised or not confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection as of Jan 31, 2020, and nine inpatients without available key information in their medical records, we included 191 inpatients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) in the final analysis. 54 patients died during hospitalisation and 137 were discharged. The median age of the 191 patients was 56·0 years (IQR 46·0–67·0), ranging from 18 years to 87 years, and most patients were male (table 1). Comorbidities were present in nearly half of patients, with hypertension being the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease (table 1). The most common symptoms on admission were fever and cough, followed by sputum production and fatigue (table 1). Lymphocytopenia occurred in 77 (40%) patients. 181 (95%) patients received antibiotics and 41 (21%) received antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir; table 2). Systematic corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin use differed significantly between non-survivors and survivors (table 2). The comparison of characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients from the two hospitals are shown in the appendix (pp 2–4).Table 1Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings of patients on admissionTotal (n=191)Non-survivor (n=54)Survivor (n=137)p valueDemographics and clinical characteristicsAge, years56·0 (46·0–67·0)69·0 (63·0–76·0)52·0 (45·0–58·0)<0·0001Sex......0·15Female72 (38%)16 (30%)56 (41%)..Male119 (62%)38 (70%)81 (59%)..Exposure history73 (38%)14 (26%)59 (43%)0·028Current smoker11 (6%)5 (9%)6 (4%)0·21Comorbidity91 (48%)36 (67%)55 (40%)0·0010Hypertension58 (30%)26 (48%)32 (23%)0·0008Diabetes36 (19%)17 (31%)19 (14%)0·0051Coronary heart disease15 (8%)13 (24%)2 (1%)<0·0001Chronic obstructive lung disease6 (3%)4 (7%)2 (1%)0·047Carcinoma2 (1%)02 (1%)0·37Chronic kidney disease2 (1%)2 (4%)00·024Other22 (12%)11 (20%)11 (8%)0·016Respiratory rate >24 breaths per min56 (29%)34 (63%)22 (16%)<0·0001Pulse ≥125 beats per min2 (1%)2 (4%)00·024Systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg1 (1%)01 (1%)0·53Fever (temperature ≥37·3°C)180 (94%)51 (94%)129 (94%)0·94Cough151 (79%)39 (72%)112 (82%)0·15Sputum44 (23%)14 (26%)30 (22%)0·55Myalgia29 (15%)8 (15%)21 (15%)0·93Fatigue44 (23%)15 (28%)29 (21%)0·33Diarrhoea9 (5%)2 (4%)7 (5%)0·67Nausea or vomiting7 (4%)3 (6%)4 (3%)0·40SOFA score2·0 (1·0–4·0)4·5 (4·0–6·0)1·0 (1·0–2·0)<0·0001qSOFA score1·0 (0·0–1·0)1·0 (1·0–1·0)0·0 (0·0–1·0)<0·0001CURB-65 score0·0 (0·0–2·0)2·0 (1·0–3·0)0·0 (0·0–1·0)<0·00010–1141/188 (75%)16 (30%)125/134 (93%)<0·0001** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.232/188 (17%)23 (43%)9/134 (7%)..3–515/188 (8%)15 (28%)0/134..Disease severity status......<0·0001General72 (38%)072 (53%)..Severe66 (35%)12 (22%)54 (39%)..Critical53 (28%)42 (78%)11 (8%)..Time from illness onset to hospital admission, days11·0 (8·0–14·0)11·0 (8·0–15·0)11·0 (8·0–13·0)0·53Laboratory findingsWhite blood cell count, × 109 per L6·2 (4·5–9·5)9·8 (6·9–13·9)5·2 (4·3–7·7)<0·0001<432 (17%)5 (9%)27 (20%)<0·0001** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.4–10119 (62%)24 (44%)95 (69%)..>1040 (21%)25 (46%)15 (11%)..Lymphocyte count, × 109 per L1·0 (0·6–1·3)0·6 (0·5–0·8)1·1 (0·8–1·5)<0·0001<0·877 (40%)41 (76%)36 (26%)<0·0001Haemoglobin, g/L128·0 (119·0–140·0)126·0 (115·0–138·0)128·0 (120·0–140·0)0·30Anaemia29 (15%)14 (26%)15 (11%)0·0094Platelet count, × 109 per L206·0 (155·0–262·0)165·5 (107·0–229·0)220·0 (168·0–271·0)<0·0001<10013 (7%)11 (20%)2 (1%)<0·0001Albumin, g/L32·3 (29·1–35·8)29·1 (26·5–31·3)33·6 (30·6–36·4)<0·0001ALT, U/L30·0 (17·0–46·0)40·0 (24·0–51·0)27·0 (15·0–40·0)0·0050>4059/189 (31%)26 (48%)33/135 (24%)0·0015Creatinine >133 μmol/L8/186 (4%)5 (9%)3/132 (2%)0·045Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L300·0 (234·0–407·0)521·0 (363·0–669·0)253·5 (219·0–318·0)<0·0001>245123/184 (67%)53 (98%)70/130 (54%)<0·0001Creatine kinase, U/L21·5 (13·0–72·4)39·0 (19·5–151·0)18·0 (12·5–52·1)0·0010>18522/168 (13%)11/52 (21%)11/116 (9%)0·038High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, pg/mL4·1 (2·0–14·1)22·2 (5·6–83·1)3·0 (1·1–5·5)<0·0001>2824/145 (17%)23/50 (46%)1/95 (1%)<0·0001Prothrombin time, s11·6 (10·6–13·0)12·1 (11·2–13·7)11·4 (10·4–12·6)0·0004<16171/182 (94%)47 (87%)124/128 (97%)0·016** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.≥1611/182 (6%)7 (13%)4/128 (3%)..D-dimer, μg/mL0·8 (0·4–3·2)5·2 (1·5–21·1)0·6 (0·3–1·0)<0·0001≤0·555/172 (32%)4 (7%)51/118 (43%)<0·0001** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.>0·5 to ≤145/172 (26%)6 (11%)39/118 (33%)..>172/172 (42%)44 (81%)28/118 (24%)..Serum ferritin, μg/L722·0 (377·2–1435·3)1435·3 (728·9–2000·0)503·2 (264·0–921·5)<0·0001>300102/128 (80%)44/46 (96%)58/82 (71%)0·0008IL-6, pg/mL7·4 (5·3–10·8)11·0 (7·5–14·4)6·3 (5·0–7·9)<0·0001Procalcitonin, ng/mL0·1 (0·1–0·1)0·1 (0·1–0·5)0·1 (0·1–0·1)<0·0001<0·1114/164 (70%)19/51 (37%)95/113 (84%)<0·0001** χ2 test comparing all subcategories.≥0·1 to <0·2530/164 (18%)16/51 (31%)14/113 (12%)..≥0·25 to <0·56/164 (4%)3/51 (6%)3/113 (3%)..≥0·514/164 (9%)13/51 (25%)1/113 (1%)..Imaging featuresConsolidation112 (59%)40 (74%)72 (53%)0·0065Ground-glass opacity136 (71%)44 (81%)92 (67%)0·049Bilateral pulmonary infiltration143 (75%)45 (83%)98 (72%)0·090Data are median (IQR), n (%), or n/N (%). p values were calculated by Mann-Whitney U test, χ2 test, or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.

The median time from illness onset (ie, before admission) to discharge was 22·0 days (IQR 18·0–25·0), whereas the median time to death was 18·5 days (15·0–22·0; table 2). 32 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. The median time from illness onset to invasive mechanical ventilation was 14·5 days (12·0–19·0). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in three patients, none of whom survived. Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure, and septic shock (table 2). Half of non-survivors experienced a secondary infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The frequency of complications were higher in non-survivors than survivors (table 2). In univariable analysis, odds of in-hospital death was higher in patients with diabetes or coronary heart disease (table 3). Age, lymphopenia, leucocytosis, and elevated ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, IL-6, prothrombin time, creatinine, and procalcitonin were also associated with death (table 3).Table 3Risk factors associated with in-hospital deathUnivariable OR (95% CI)p valueMultivariable OR (95% CI)p valueDemographics and clinical characteristicsAge, years** Per 1 unit increase.1·14 (1·09–1·18)<0·00011·10 (1·03–1·17)0·0043Female sex (vs male)0·61 (0·31–1·20)0·15....Current smoker (vs non-smoker)2·23 (0·65–7·63)0·20....Comorbidity present (vs not present)Chronic obstructive lung disease5·40 (0·96–30·40)0·056....Coronary heart disease21·40 (4·64–98·76)<0·00012·14 (0·26–17·79)0·48Diabetes2·85 (1·35–6·05)0·0062....Hypertension3·05 (1·57–5·92)0·0010....Respiratory rate, breaths per min≤241 (ref)......>248·89 (4·34–18·19)<0·0001....SOFA score6·14 (3·48–10·85)<0·00015·65 (2·61–12·23)<0·0001qSOFA score12·00 (5·06–28·43)<0·0001....Laboratory findingsWhite blood cell count, × 109 per L<40·73 (0·26–2·10)0·56....4–101 (ref)......>106·60 (3·02–14·41)<0·0001....Lymphocyte count, × 109 per L** Per 1 unit increase.0·02 (0·01–0·08)<0·00010·19 (0·02–1·62)0·13ALT, U/L≤401 (ref)......>402·87 (1·48–5·57)0·0018....Creatinine, μmol/L≤1331 (ref)......>1334·39 (1·01–19·06)0·048....Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L≤2451 (ref)......>24545·43 (6·10–338·44)0·0002....Creatine kinase, U/L≤1851 (ref)......>1852·56 (1·03–6·36)0·043....High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, pg/mL≤281 (ref)......>2880·07 (10·34–620·36)<0·0001....D-dimer, μg/mL≤0·51 (ref)..1 (ref)..> 0·51·96 (0·52–7·43)0·322·14 (0·21–21·39)0·52> 120·04 (6·52–61·56)<0·000118·42 (2·64–128·55)0·0033Prothrombin time, s<161 (ref)......≥164·62 (1·29–16·50)0·019....Serum ferritin, μg/L≤3001 (ref)......>3009·10 (2·04–40·58)0·0038....IL-6, pg/mL** Per 1 unit increase.1·12 (1·03–1·23)0·0080....Procalcitonin, ng/mL** Per 1 unit increase.13·75 (1·81–104·40)0·011....OR=odds ratio.

We included 171 patients with complete data for all variables (53 non-survivors and 118 survivors) in the multivariable logistic regression model. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL at admission were associated with increased odds of death (table 3). When adjusting for study centre, our generalised linear model showed similar results (appendix p 5). For survivors, the median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) from illness onset, but the virus was continuously detectable until death in non-survivors (table 2; figure 1). The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. Among 29 patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir and were discharged, the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14·0 days (IQR 10·0–17·0) and the median duration of viral shedding was 22·0 days (18·0–24·0). The median duration of viral shedding was 19·0 days (17·0–22·0) in patients with severe disease status and 24·0 days (22·0–30·0) in patients with critical disease status.Figure 1Clinical courses of major symptoms and outcomes and duration of viral shedding from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19Show full captionFigure shows median duration of symptoms and onset of complications and outcomes.

Major laboratory markers were tracked from illness onset (figure 2). Baseline lymphocyte count was significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors; in survivors, lymphocyte count was lowest on day 7 after illness onset and improved during hospitalisation, whereas severe lymphopenia was observed until death in non-survivors. Levels of d-dimer, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course, and increased with illness deterioration (figure 2). In non-survivors, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I increased rapidly from day 16 after disease onset, whereas lactate dehydrogenase increased for both survivors and non-survivors in the early stage of illness, but decreased from day 13 for survivors.Figure 2Temporal changes in laboratory markers from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19Show full captionFigure shows temporal changes in d-dimer (A), lymphocytes (B), IL-6 (C), serum ferritin (D), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (E), and lactate dehydrogenase (F).

Median time from illness onset to dyspnoea was similar in survivors and non-survivors, with a median duration of dyspnoea of 13·0 days (9·0–16·5) for survivors (table 2; figure 1). In survivors, the median duration of fever was 12·0 days (8·0–13·0) and cough persisted for 19·0 days (IQR 12·0–23·0; figure 1). 62 (45%) survivors still had cough on discharge and 39 (72%) non-survivors still had cough at the time of death. The dynamic profiles of fever, cough, and dyspnoea are shown in the appendix (p 6). Sepsis developed at a median of 9·0 days (7·0–13·0) after illness onset among all patients, followed by ARDS (12·0 days [8·0–15·0]), acute cardiac injury (15·0 days [10·0–17·0]), acute kidney injury (15·0 days [13·0–19·5]), and secondary infection (17·0 days [13·0–19·0]). The initiation time and duration of systematic corticosteroid use was also similar between the two groups. Among non-survivors, the median time from illness onset was 10·0 days (7·0–14·0) to sepsis, 12·0 days (8·0–15·0) to ARDS, 14·5 days (9·5–17·0) to acute cardiac injury, and 17·0 days (13·0–19·0) to secondary infection (figure 1; table 2). Among survivors, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury were observed in one patient each, occurring 9 days (acute kidney injury), 14 days (secondary infection), and 21 days (acute cardiac injury) after illness onset. The median time from dyspnoea to intubation was 10·0 days (IQR 5·0–12·5) for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation and the time from invasive mechanical ventilation to occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 8·0 days (2·0–9·0; figure 1). This retrospective cohort study identified several risk factors for death in adults in Wuhan who were hospitalised with COVID-19. In particular, older age, d-dimer levels greater than 1 μg/mL, and higher SOFA score on admission were associated with higher odds of in-hospital death. Additionally, elevated levels of blood IL-6, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and lactate dehydrogenase and lymphopenia were more commonly seen in severe COVID-19 illness. Sustained viral detection in throat samples was observed in both survivors and non-survivors. Previously, older age has been reported as an important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS.14Choi KW Chau TN Tsang O et al.Outcomes and prognostic factors in 267 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.Ann Intern Med. 2003; 139: 715-723Google Scholar,  15Hong K-H Choi J-P Hong S-H et al.Predictors of mortality in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).Thorax. 2018; 73: 286-289Google Scholar The current study confirmed that increased age was associated with death in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies in macaques inoculated with SARS-CoV found that older macaques had stronger host innate responses to virus infection than younger adults, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, whereas expression of type I interferon beta was reduced.16Smits SL de Lang A van den Brand JMA et al.Exacerbated innate host response to SARS-CoV in aged non-human primates.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000756-eGoogle Scholar The age-dependent defects in T-cell and B-cell function and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a deficiency in control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses, potentially leading to poor outcome.17Opal SM Girard TD Ely EW The immunopathogenesis of sepsis in elderly patients.Clin Infect Dis. 2005; 41: S504-S512Google Scholar SOFA score is a good diagnostic marker for sepsis and septic shock, and reflects the state and degree of multi-organ dysfunction.18Singer M Deutschman CS Seymour CW et al.The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).JAMA. 2016; 315: 801-810Google Scholar,  19Ferreira FL Bota DP Bross A Mélot C Vincent JL Serial evaluation of the SOFA score to predict outcome in critically ill patients.JAMA. 2001; 286: 1754-1758Google Scholar Although bacterial infections are usually regarded as a leading cause of sepsis, viral infection can also cause sepsis syndrome. Previously, we determined that sepsis occurred in nearly 40% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia due to viral infection.20Zhou F Wang Y Liu Y et al.Disease severity and clinical outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses in adults: a multicentre prospective registry study from the CAP-China Network.Eur Respir J. 2019; 54: 1802406Google Scholar In the current study, we found that more than half of patients developed sepsis. Additionally, we found that more than 70% of patients had white blood cell count below 10·0 × 109 per L or procalcitonin below 0·25 ng/mL, and no bacterial pathogens were detected in these patients on admission. Sepsis was a common complication, which might be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis of sepsis in COVID-19 illness. Cardiac complications, including new or worsening heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction are common in patients with pneumonia. Cardiac arrest occurs in about 3% of inpatients with pneumonia.21Marrie TJ Shariatzadeh MR Community-acquired pneumonia requiring admission to an intensive care unit: a descriptive study.Medicine (Baltimore). 2007; 86: 103-111Google Scholar Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation.22Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Shachkina S Chirinos JA Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system.Lancet. 2013; 381: 496-505Google Scholar Coronary heart disease has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections.22Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Shachkina S Chirinos JA Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system.Lancet. 2013; 381: 496-505Google Scholar,  23Udell JA Zawi R Bhatt DL et al.Association between influenza vaccination and cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients: a meta-analysis.JAMA. 2013; 310: 1711-1720Google Scholar,  24Blackburn R Zhao H Pebody R Hayward A Warren-Gash C Laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections as predictors of hospital admission for myocardial infarction and stroke: time-series analysis of English data for 2004–2015.Clin Infect Dis. 2018; 67: 8-17Google Scholar In this study, increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I during hospitalisation was found in more than half of those who died. The first autopsy of a 53-year-old woman with chronic renal failure in Jinyintan Hospital showed acute myocardial infarction (data not published; personal communication with a pathologist from the Chinese Academy of Science). About 90% of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity, marked by increased d-dimer concentrations.25Milbrandt EB Reade MC Lee M et al.Prevalence and significance of coagulation abnormalities in community-acquired pneumonia.Mol Med. 2009; 15: 438-445Google Scholar In this study, we found d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL is associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. High levels of d-dimer have a reported association with 28-day mortality in patients with infection or sepsis identified in the emergency department.26Rodelo JR De la Rosa G Valencia ML et al.D-dimer is a significant prognostic factor in patients with suspected infection and sepsis.Am J Emerg Med. 2012; 30: 1991-1999Google Scholar Contributory mechanisms include systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that are mediators of atherosclerosis directly contributing to plaque rupture through local inflammation, induction of procoagulant factors, and haemodynamic changes, which predispose to ischaemia and thrombosis.27Smeeth L Thomas SL Hall AJ Hubbard R Farrington P Vallance P Risk of myocardial infarction and stroke after acute infection or vaccination.N Engl J Med. 2004; 351: 2611-2618Google Scholar,  28Corrales-Medina VF Musher DM Wells GA Chirinos JA Chen L Fine MJ Cardiac complications in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: incidence, timing, risk factors, and association with short-term mortality.Circulation. 2012; 125: 773-781Google Scholar,  29Davidson JA Warren-Gash C Cardiovascular complications of acute respiratory infections: current research and future directions.Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2019; 17: 939-942Google Scholar In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed on myocytes and vascular endothelial cells,30Gallagher PE Ferrario CM Tallant EA Regulation of ACE2 in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts.Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2008; 295: H2373-H2479Google Scholar,  31Mendoza-Torres E Oyarzún A Mondaca-Ruff D et al.ACE2 and vasoactive peptides: novel players in cardiovascular/renal remodeling and hypertension.Ther Adv Cardiovasc Dis. 2015; 9: 217-237Google Scholar so there is at least theoretical potential possibility of direct cardiac involvement by the virus. Of note, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue has been documented in fatal cases of COVID-19, although viral detection studies were not reported.32Xu Z Shi L Wang Y et al.Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.Lancet Respir Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 18)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-XGoogle Scholar The level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of transmission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. For SARS-CoV, viral RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from about a third of patients as long as 4 weeks after disease onset.33Xu D Zhang Z Jin L et al.Persistent shedding of viable SARS-CoV in urine and stool of SARS patients during the convalescent phase.Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2005; 24: 165-171Google Scholar Similarly, the duration of MERS-CoV RNA detection in lower respiratory specimans persisted for at least 3 weeks,34Corman VM Albarrak AM Omrani AS et al.Viral shedding and antibody response in 37 patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection.Clin Infect Dis. 2016; 62: 477-483Google Scholar,  35Oh MD Park WB Choe PG et al.Viral load kinetics of MERS coronavirus infection.N Engl J Med. 2016; 375: 1303-1405Google Scholar whereas the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection has not been well characterised. In the current study, we found that the detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for a median of 20 days in survivors and that it was sustained until death in non-survivors. This has important implications for both patient isolation decision making and guidance around the length of antiviral treatment. In severe influenza virus infection, prolonged viral shedding was associated with fatal outcome and delayed antiviral treatment was an independent risk factor for prolonged virus detection.36Wang Y Guo Q Yan Z et al.Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding in patients with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection.J Infect Dis. 2018; 217: 1708-1717Google Scholar Similarly, effective antiviral treatment might improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in the current study. Randomised clinical trials for lopinavir/ritonavir (ChiCTR2000029308) and intravenous remdesivir (NCT04257656, NCT04252664) in treatment of COVID-19 are currently in progress. Our study has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective study design, not all laboratory tests were done in all patients, including lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and serum ferritin. Therefore, their role might be underestimated in predicting in-hospital death. Second, patients were sometimes transferred late in their illness to the two included hospitals. Lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high-dose corticosteroid use might have also contributed to the poor clinical outcomes in some patients. Third, the estimated duration of viral shedding is limited by the frequency of respiratory specimen collection, lack of quantitative viral RNA detection, and relatively low positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat-swabs.37Zou L Ruan F Huang M et al.SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients.N Engl J Med. 2020;  (published online Feb 19.)DOI:10.1056/NEJMc2001737Google Scholar Fourth, by excluding patients still in hospital as of Jan 31, 2020, and thus relatively more severe disease at an earlier stage, the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of COVID-19. Last but not least, interpretation of our findings might be limited by the sample size. However, by including all adult patients in the two designated hospitals for COVID-19, we believe our study population is representative of cases diagnosed and treated in Wuhan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort study among patients with COVID-19 who have experienced a definite outcome. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and elevated d-dimer at admission were risk factors for death of adult patients with COVID-19. The prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for testing novel coronavirus antiviral interventions in efforts to improve outcomes. This online publication has been corrected.

SARS CoV-1 and 2 share almost 80% of genetic sequences and use the same host cell receptor to initiate viral infection. However, SARS predominantly affected individuals in close contact with infected animals and health care workers. In contrast, CoV-2 exhibits robust person to person spread, most likely by means of asymptomatic carriers, which has resulted in greater spread of disease, overall morbidity and mortality, despite its lesser virulence.

ID:126981,N/A,medical,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention","INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)This topic will discuss the virology, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19. The management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)Issues related to COVID-19 in specific populations are discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)VIROLOGY — Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus in the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (as well as several bat coronaviruses), but in a different clade. The structure of the receptor-binding gene region is very similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and the virus has been shown to use the same receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for cell entry [4]. The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has proposed that this virus be designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [5].The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, another betacoronavirus, appears more distantly related [6,7]. The closest RNA sequence similarity is to two bat coronaviruses, and it appears likely that bats are the primary source; whether COVID-19 virus is transmitted directly from bats or through some other mechanism (eg, through an intermediate host) is unknown [8]. (See ""Coronaviruses"", section on 'Viral serotypes'.)In a phylogenetic analysis of 103 strains of SARS-CoV-2 from China, two different types of SARS-CoV-2 were identified, designated type L (accounting for 70 percent of the strains) and type S (accounting for 30 percent) [9]. The L type predominated during the early days of the epidemic in China, but accounted for a lower proportion of strains outside of Wuhan than in Wuhan. The clinical implications of these findings are uncertain. EPIDEMIOLOGYGeographic distribution — Globally, more than five million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported. Updated case counts in English can be found on the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control websites. An interactive map highlighting confirmed cases throughout the world can be found here. Since the first reports of cases from Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China, at the end of 2019, cases have been reported in all continents, except for Antarctica.In the United States, COVID-19 has been reported in all 50 states, Washington DC, and at least four territories [10]. The cumulative incidence varies by state and likely depends on a number of factors, including population density and demographics, extent of testing and reporting, and timing of mitigation strategies. In the United States, outbreaks in long-term care facilities and homeless shelters have emphasized the risk of exposure and infection in congregate settings [11-13]. (See 'Risk of transmission' below.)Transmission — Understanding of the transmission risk is incomplete. Epidemiologic investigation in Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak identified an initial association with a seafood market that sold live animals, where most patients had worked or visited and which was subsequently closed for disinfection [14]. However, as the outbreak progressed, person-to-person spread became the main mode of transmission. Person-to-personRoute of person-to-person transmission — Direct person-to-person transmission is the primary means of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is thought to occur through close-range contact, mainly via respiratory droplets; virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes; infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters). Whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the airborne route (through particles smaller than droplets that remain in the air over time and distance) under natural conditions has been a controversial issue. One letter to the editor described a study in which SARS-CoV-2 grown in tissue culture remained viable in experimentally generated aerosols for at least three hours [15]; some studies have identified viral RNA in ventilation systems and in air samples of hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19, but cultures for viable virus were not performed in these studies [16-18]. Other studies using specialized imaging to visualize respiratory exhalations have suggested that respiratory droplets may get aerosolized or carried in a gas cloud and have horizontal trajectories beyond six feet (two meters) with speaking, coughing, or sneezing [19-21]. However, the direct relevance of these findings to the epidemiology of COVID-19 and their clinical implications are unclear. Long-range airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not clearly been documented [22], and in a few reports of health care workers exposed to patients with undiagnosed infection while using only contact and droplet precautions, no secondary infections were identified despite the absence of airborne precautions [23,24]. Reflecting the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms, recommendations on airborne precautions in the health care setting vary by location; airborne precautions are universally recommended when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood, ocular secretions, and semen, but the role of these sites in transmission is uncertain [25-30]. In particular, several reports have described detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stool specimens, even after viral RNA could no longer be detected from upper respiratory specimens [28,29], and live virus has been cultured from stool in rare cases [26,31]. Although it would be difficult to confirm, fecal-oral transmission has not been clinically described, and according to a joint WHO-China report, did not appear to be a significant factor in the spread of infection [32]. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood has also been reported in some but not all studies that have tested for it [25,26,29,33]. However, the likelihood of bloodborne transmission (eg, through blood products or needlesticks) appears low; respiratory viruses are generally not transmitted through the bloodborne route, and transfusion-transmitted infection has not been reported for SARS-CoV-2 or for the related MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV [34]. (See ""Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing"", section on 'Emerging infectious disease agents'.)Viral shedding and period of infectivity — The precise interval during which an individual with COVID-19 is infectious is uncertain. It appears that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted prior to the development of symptoms and throughout the course of illness, particularly early in the course. However, most data informing this issue are from studies evaluating viral RNA detection from respiratory and other specimens; detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, and thus prolonged viral RNA detection following the resolution of illness does not necessarily indicate infectiousness. Largely indirect data suggest that infected individuals are more likely to be infectious in the earlier stages of infection. Viral RNA levels from upper respiratory specimens appear to be higher soon after symptom onset compared with later in the illness [35-39]. Additionally, in a study of nine patients with mild COVID-19, infectious virus was isolated from naso/oropharyngeal and sputum specimens during the first eight days of illness, but not after this interval, despite continued high viral RNA levels at these sites [37]. One modeling study, based on the timing of infection among 77 transmission pairs in China (with a mean serial interval of 5.8 days between the onset of symptoms in each pair) and assumptions about incubation period, suggested that infectiousness started 2.3 days prior to symptom onset, peaked 0.7 days before symptom onset, and declined within seven days; however, most patients were isolated following symptom onset, which would reduce the risk of transmission later in illness regardless of infectiousness [38]. In another study that evaluated over 2500 close contacts of 100 patients with COVID-19 in Taiwan, all of the 22 secondary cases had their first exposure to the index case within six days of symptom onset; there were no infections documented in the 850 contacts whose exposure was after this interval [40].Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or individuals within the incubation period) has also been well documented [41-46]. The biologic basis for this is supported by a study of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility, in which infectious virus was cultured from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive upper respiratory tract specimens in presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients as early as six days prior to the development of typical symptoms [47]. However, the extent to which asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission occurs and how much it contributes to the pandemic remain unknown. In an analysis of 157 locally acquired COVID-19 cases in Singapore, transmission during the incubation period was estimated to account for 6.4 percent; in such cases, the exposures occurred one to three days prior to symptom development [48]. Large-scale serologic screening may be able to provide a better sense of the scope of asymptomatic infections and inform epidemiologic analysis; several serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [49,50]. How long a person remains infectious is also uncertain, but available data suggest that prolonged viral RNA shedding after symptom resolution is not clearly associated with prolonged infectiousness. The duration of viral RNA shedding is variable; there appears to be a wide range, which may depend on severity of illness [29,37,51-53]. In one study of 21 patients with mild illness (no hypoxia), 90 percent had repeated negative viral RNA tests on nasopharyngeal swabs by 10 days after the onset of symptoms; tests were positive for longer in patients with more severe illness [51]. In contrast, in another study of 56 patients with mild to moderate illness (none required intensive care), the median duration of viral RNA shedding from naso- or oropharyngeal specimens was 24 days, and the longest was 42 days [54]. However, as mentioned above, detectable viral RNA does not always correlate with isolation of infectious virus, and there may be a threshold of viral RNA level below which infectivity is unlikely. In the study of nine patients with mild COVID-19 described above, infectious virus was not detected from respiratory specimens when the viral RNA level was <106 copies/mL [37]. According to information from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when patients continue to have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory samples following clinical recovery, by three days after recovery, the RNA concentrations are generally at or below the levels at which replication-competent virus can be reliably isolated; additionally, isolation of infectious virus from upper respiratory specimens more than nine days after illness onset has not yet been documented [55]. Infectious virus has also not been isolated from respiratory specimens of patients who have a repeat positive RNA test following clinical improvement and initial viral clearance [56]. (See 'Immunity and risk of reinfection' below.)One study reported a patient with critical COVID-19 from whom replicative virus was isolated from the stool 28 days following symptom onset; further data are needed to understand the frequency and clinical significance of this finding [31]. The relevance of viral RNA detection to duration of infection control precautions is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Risk of transmission — The risk of transmission from an individual with SARS-CoV-2 infection varies by the type and duration of exposure, use of preventive measures, and likely individual factors (eg, the amount of virus in respiratory secretions). Most secondary infections have been described among household contacts, in congregate or health care settings when personal protective equipment was not used (including hospitals [57] and long-term care facilities [11]), and in closed settings (eg, cruise ships [58]). However, reported clusters of cases after social or work gatherings also highlight the risk of transmission through close, non-household contact.Contact tracing in the early stages of epidemics at various locations suggested that most secondary infections were among household contacts, with a secondary attack rate of up to 15 percent [32,59-62]; some studies have suggested even higher household infection rates [46,63,64]. According to a joint WHO-China report, the rate of secondary COVID-19 in various locations ranged from 1 to 5 percent among tens of thousands of close contacts of confirmed patients in China; most of these occurred within households, with an in-household secondary attack rate of 3 to 10 percent [32]. In the United States, the symptomatic secondary attack rate was 0.45 percent among 445 close contacts of 10 confirmed patients; among household members, the rate was 10.5 percent [59]. In a similar study in Korea, the rates were comparable, with secondary infections in 0.55 percent of all contacts and 7.6 percent of family members [60].Clusters of cases have also been reported following family, work, or social gatherings where close, personal contact can occur [65,66]. As an example, epidemiologic analysis of a cluster of cases in the state of Illinois showed probable transmission through two family gatherings at which communal food was consumed, embraces were shared, and extended face-to-face conversations were exchanged with symptomatic individuals who were later confirmed to have COVID-19 [65]. A report of an outbreak among a choir group, with 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases identified among 61 members who attended a practice session, raised the possibility of a high transmission risk through singing in close proximity [67].The risk of transmission with more indirect contact (eg, passing someone with infection on the street, handling items that were previously handled by someone with infection) is not well established and is likely low. Environmental contamination — Virus present on contaminated surfaces may be another source of infection if susceptible individuals touch these surfaces and then transfer infectious virus to mucous membranes in the mouth, eyes, or nose. The frequency and relative importance of this type of transmission remain unclear. It may be more likely to be a potential source of infection in settings where there is heavy viral contamination (eg, in an infected individual's household or in health care settings). Extensive SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces in hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19 has been described [16,68]. In a study from Singapore, viral RNA was detected on nearly all surfaces tested (handles, light switches, bed and handrails, interior doors and windows, toilet bowl, sink basin) in the airborne infection isolation room of a patient with symptomatic mild COVID-19 prior to routine cleaning [16]. Viral RNA was not detected on similar surfaces in the rooms of two other symptomatic patients following routine cleaning (with sodium dichloroisocyanurate). Of note, viral RNA detection does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus [37]. It is unknown how long SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces [15,69,70]; other coronaviruses have been tested and may survive on inanimate surfaces for up to six to nine days without disinfection. In a study evaluating the survival of viruses dried on a plastic surface at room temperature, a specimen containing SARS-CoV (a virus closely related to SARS-CoV-2) had detectable infectivity at six but not nine days [70]. However, in a systematic review of similar studies, various disinfectants (including ethanol at concentrations between 62 and 71%) inactivated a number of coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 within one minute [69]. Based on data concerning other coronaviruses, duration of viral persistence on surfaces also likely depends on the ambient temperature, relative humidity, and the size of the initial inoculum [71].These data highlight the importance of environmental disinfection in the home and health care setting. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Environmental disinfection'.)Uncertain risk of animal contact — SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to have originally been transmitted to humans from an animal host, but the ongoing risk of transmission through animal contact is uncertain. There is no evidence suggesting animals (including domesticated animals) are a major source of infection in humans. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described in animals in both natural and experimental settings. There have been rare reports of animals with SARS-CoV-2 infection (including asymptomatic infections in dogs and symptomatic infections in cats) following close contact with a human with COVID-19 [72,73]. Moreover, asymptomatic, experimentally infected domestic cats may transmit SARS-CoV-2 to cats they are caged with [74]. The risk of infection may vary by species. In one study evaluating infection in animals after intranasal viral inoculation, SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently in ferrets and cats; viral replication was also detected in dogs, but they appeared to be less susceptible overall to experimental infection [75]. Pigs and poultry were not susceptible to infection. Given the uncertainty regarding the transmission risk and the apparent susceptibility of some animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the United States CDC recommends that pets be kept away from other animals or people outside of the household and that people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 try to avoid close contact with household pets, as they should with human household members, for the duration of their self-isolation period. There have been no reports of domesticated animals transmitting SARS-CoV-2 infection to humans. Immunity and risk of reinfection — Antibodies to the virus are induced in those who have become infected. Preliminary evidence suggests that some of these antibodies are protective, but this remains to be definitively established. Moreover, it is unknown whether all infected patients mount a protective immune response and how long any protective effect will last.Data on protective immunity following COVID-19 are emerging [36,37,76]. A case series evaluating convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 identified neutralizing activity in plasma of recovered patients that appeared to be transferred to recipients following plasma infusion [76]. Similarly, in another study of 23 patients who recovered from COVID-19, antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in most patients by 14 days following the onset of symptoms; ELISA antibody titers correlated with neutralizing activity [36]. Animal studies have suggested that the immune response to infection may offer some protection against reinfection, at least in the short term. In one study of nine rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, all animals developed neutralizing antibodies; upon rechallenge with the same viral dose 35 days later, all had anamnestic immune responses and, on nasal swab, had lower viral RNA levels and more rapid viral RNA decline compared with the initial challenge and with challenged naïve control animals [77]. Studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates in macaques have also suggested that immune responses to vaccination result in lower levels of viral RNA in respiratory tract specimens following viral challenge compared with unvaccinated controls [78,79]. Some studies have reported positive RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 following clinical improvement and negative results on two consecutive tests [80,81]. However, these positive tests occurred shortly after the negative tests, were not associated with worsening symptoms, may not represent infectious virus, and likely did not reflect reinfection. Specifically, in a report from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of patients with COVID-19 who had a repeat positive RNA test after being previously cleared from isolation, infectious virus could not be isolated in cell culture in any of the 108 patients tested [56]. Among 790 contacts, there were no newly confirmed cases that were traced to exposure during the period of the repeat positive test.As above, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization for tests that identify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum or plasma [50]. Should evidence confirm that the presence of these antibodies reflects a protective immune response, serologic screening will be an important tool to understand population immunity and distinguish individuals who are at lower risk for reinfection.CLINICAL FEATURESIncubation period — The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure [82-84].In a study of 1099 patients with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, the median incubation period was four days (interquartile range two to seven days) [83]. Using data from 181 publicly reported, confirmed cases in China with identifiable exposure, one modeling study estimated that symptoms would develop in 2.5 percent of infected individuals within 2.2 days and in 97.5 percent of infected individuals within 11.5 days [85]. The median incubation period in this study was 5.1 days.Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates — The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe [57,84,86-90]. Specifically, in a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity [91]: ●Mild (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in 81 percent.●Severe disease (eg, with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was reported in 14 percent.●Critical disease (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) was reported in 5 percent.●The overall case fatality rate was 2.3 percent; no deaths were reported among noncritical cases. Among hospitalized patients, the proportion of critical or fatal disease is higher [92-94]. In a study that included 2634 patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the New York City area, 14 percent were treated in the intensive care unit and 12 percent received invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality among those receiving mechanical ventilation was 88 percent [92]. However, the analysis was limited to patients who had either been discharged or died during the admission, and these patients represented fewer than half of the total population admitted with COVID-19; thus, the proportion of critically ill patients and the associated mortality rate may not accurately reflect those of the entire hospitalized population. The proportion of severe or fatal infections may also vary by location. According to a joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission, the case fatality rate ranged from 5.8 percent in Wuhan to 0.7 percent in the rest of China [32]. A modeling study suggested that the adjusted case fatality rate in mainland China was 1.4 percent [95]. Most of the fatal cases occurred in patients with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities [52,91]. In Italy, 12 percent of all detected COVID-19 cases and 16 percent of all hospitalized patients were admitted to the intensive care unit; the estimated case fatality rate was 7.2 percent in mid-March [96,97]. In contrast, the estimated case fatality rate in mid-March in South Korea was 0.9 percent [98]. This may be related to distinct demographics of infection; in Italy, the median age of patients with infection was 64 years, whereas in Korea the median age was in the 40s. (See 'Impact of age' below.)Risk factors for severe illness — Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but it predominantly occurs in adults with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities. The impact of age is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Impact of age' below.)Comorbidities and other conditions that have been associated with severe illness and mortality include (table 1) [52,91,99-102]: ●Cardiovascular disease●Diabetes mellitus●Hypertension●Chronic lung disease●Cancer (in particular hematologic malignancies, lung cancer, and metastatic disease) [103]●Chronic kidney disease●Obesity ●SmokingThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also includes immunocompromising conditions and liver disease as potential risk factors for severe illness [104], although specific data regarding risks associated with these conditions are limited. In a subset of 355 patients who died with COVID-19 in Italy, the mean number of pre-existing comorbidities was 2.7, and only 3 patients had no underlying condition [97]. Among patients with advanced age and medical comorbidities, COVID-19 is frequently severe. For example, in a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak across several long-term care facilities in Washington State, the median age of the 101 facility residents affected was 83 years, and 94 percent had a chronic underlying condition; the hospitalization and preliminary case fatality rates were 55 and 34 percent, respectively [105].Males have comprised a disproportionately high number of deaths in cohorts from China, Italy, and the United States [92,97,106].In a number of states in the United States, black and Latino individuals also appear to comprise a disproportionately high number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19, possibly related to underlying socioeconomic disparities [107-111]. Particular laboratory features have also been associated with worse outcomes (table 2). These include [52,112,113]: ●Lymphopenia●Elevated liver enzymes●Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)●Elevated inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein [CRP], ferritin)●Elevated D-dimer (>1 mcg/mL)●Elevated prothrombin time (PT)●Elevated troponin ●Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK)●Acute kidney injuryAs an example, in one study, progressive decline in the lymphocyte count and rise in the D-dimer over time were observed in nonsurvivors compared with more stable levels in survivors [57].Patients with severe disease have also been reported to have higher viral RNA levels in respiratory specimens than those with milder disease [51], although this association was not observed in a different study that measured viral RNA in salivary specimens [36]. Impact of age — Individuals of any age can acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, although adults of middle age and older are most commonly affected, and older adults are more likely to have severe disease. In several cohorts of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, the median age ranged from 49 to 56 years [57,87,88]. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections, 87 percent of patients were between 30 and 79 years old [91]. Similarly, in a modeling study based on data from mainland China, the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 increased with age, with a 1 percent rate for those 20 to 29 years old, 4 percent rate for those 50 to 59 years old, and 18 percent for those older than 80 years [95]. Older age is also associated with increased mortality [91,92,97]. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, case fatality rates were 8 and 15 percent among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older, respectively, in contrast to the 2.3 percent case fatality rate among the entire cohort [91]. Similar findings were reported from Italy, with case fatality rates of 12 and 20 percent among those aged 70 to 79 years and 80 years or older, respectively [97].In the United States, 2449 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 12 and March 16, 2020 had age, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) information available [114]; 67 percent of cases were diagnosed in those aged ≥45 years, and, similar to findings from China, mortality was highest among older individuals, with 80 percent of deaths occurring in those aged ≥65 years.Symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported [115-118]. Details of COVID-19 in children are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".) Asymptomatic infections — Asymptomatic infections have been well documented [84,119-125]. Their precise frequency is unknown, but several studies performed in various settings suggest that they are common. As examples:●In a COVID-19 outbreak on a cruise ship where nearly all passengers and staff were screened for SARS-CoV-2, approximately 17 percent of the population on board tested positive as of February 20; about half of the 619 confirmed COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [126]. A modeling study estimated that 18 percent were true asymptomatic cases (ie, did not go on to develop symptoms), although this was based on a number of assumptions, including the incubation period [121]. ●In a smaller COVID-19 outbreak within a skilled nursing facility, 27 of the 48 residents (56 percent) who had a positive screening test were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, but 24 of them ultimately developed symptoms over the next seven days [47]. ●Other studies have reported even higher proportions of asymptomatic cases [13,124]. As an example, in a report of a universal screening program of pregnant women presenting for delivery at two New York hospitals at the height of the pandemic there, 29 of 210 asymptomatic women without fever (14 percent) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal specimen [124]. Four additional women had fever or symptoms and also tested positive. Thus, of 33 women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 29 (88 percent) were asymptomatic on presentation.Even patients with asymptomatic infection may have objective clinical abnormalities [44,123]. As an example, in a study of 24 patients with asymptomatic infection who all underwent chest computed tomography (CT), 50 percent had typical ground-glass opacities or patchy shadowing, and another 20 percent had atypical imaging abnormalities [44]. Five patients developed low-grade fever, with or without other typical symptoms, a few days after diagnosis. In another study of 55 patients with asymptomatic infection identified through contact tracing, 67 percent had CT evidence of pneumonia on admission; only two patients developed hypoxia, and all recovered [123]. Clinical manifestationsInitial presentation — Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging [57,83,87,88]. However, other features, including upper respiratory tract symptoms, myalgias, diarrhea, and smell or taste disorders, are also common (table 3). There are no specific clinical features that can yet reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other viral respiratory infections, although development of dyspnea several days after the onset of initial symptoms is suggestive. (See 'Course and complications' below.) Most studies describing the clinical features of COVID-19 have been performed in hospitalized populations. In a study describing 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, the most common clinical features at the onset of illness were [57]:●Fever in 99 percent (note that fever on presentation is not this common in all studies; see below)●Fatigue in 70 percent●Dry cough in 59 percent●Anorexia in 40 percent●Myalgias in 35 percent●Dyspnea in 31 percent●Sputum production in 27 percentOther cohort studies of patients with confirmed COVID-19 have reported a similar range of clinical findings [57,87,127-129]. However, fever is not a universal finding on presentation. In one study, fever was reported in almost all patients, but approximately 20 percent had a very low grade fever <100.4°F/38°C [87]. In another study of 1099 patients from Wuhan and other areas in China, fever (defined as an axillary temperature over 99.5°F/37.5°C) was present in only 44 percent on admission but was ultimately noted in 89 percent during the hospitalization [83]. In a study of over 5000 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, only 31 percent had a temperature >100.4°F/38°C at presentation [92].Although not highlighted in the initial cohort studies from China, smell and taste disorders (eg, anosmia and dysgeusia) have also been reported as common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 [130-132]. In a survey of 59 patients with COVID-19 in Italy, 34 percent self-reported either a smell or taste aberration and 19 percent reported both [131]. In a survey of 202 outpatients with mild COVID-19 in Italy, 64 percent reported alterations in smell or taste, and 24 percent reported very severe alterations; smell or taste changes were reported as the only symptom in 3 percent overall and preceded symptoms in another 12 percent [133]. Whether this finding is a distinguishing feature of COVID-19 is uncertain. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea and diarrhea) have also been reported; and in some patients, they may be the presenting complaint [57,87,129,134]. In a systematic review of studies reporting on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with confirmed COVID-19, the pooled prevalence was 18 percent overall, with diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, or abdominal pain reported in 13, 10, and 9 percent, respectively [28]. Other reported symptoms have included headache, sore throat, and rhinorrhea [83,88]. Conjunctivitis has also been described [27].Dermatologic findings in patients with COVID-19 are not well characterized. There have been reports of maculopapular, urticarial, and vesicular eruptions and transient livedo reticularis [135-137]. Reddish-purple nodules on the distal digits similar in appearance to pernio (chilblains) have also been described, mainly in children and young adults with documented or suspected COVID-19, although an association has not been clearly established [137-140]. Some are calling this finding ""COVID toes.""Course and complications — As above, symptomatic infection can range from mild to critical. (See 'Spectrum of illness severity and case fatality rates' above.)Some patients with initially nonsevere symptoms may progress over the course of a week. In one study of 138 patients hospitalized in Wuhan for pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, dyspnea developed after a median of five days since the onset of symptoms, and hospital admission occurred after a median of seven days of symptoms [57]. In another study, the median time to dyspnea was eight days [87].Several complications of COVID-19 have been described:●Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major complication in patients with severe disease and can manifest shortly after the onset of dyspnea. In the study of 138 patients described above, ARDS developed in 20 percent a median of eight days after the onset of symptoms; mechanical ventilation was implemented in 12.3 percent [57]. In another study of 201 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, 41 percent developed ARDS; age greater than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were each associated with ARDS [112]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Clinical features in critically ill patients'.)●Other complications have included arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shock [57,106,141,142]. In one study, these were reported in 17, 7, and 9 percent, respectively [57]. In a series of 21 severely ill patients admitted to the ICU in the United States, one-third developed cardiomyopathy [141]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●Thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism and acute stroke (even in patients younger than 50 years of age without risk factors), have also been reported [143-148]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Clinical features'.)●Some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome, with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines; these laboratory abnormalities have been associated with critical and fatal illnesses [87,149,150]. (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.) ●Other inflammatory complications have been described. Guillain-Barré syndrome may occur, with onset 5 to 10 days after initial symptoms [151]. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome with clinical features similar to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome has also been described in children with COVID-19. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)●Secondary infections do not appear to be common complications of COVID-19 overall, although data are limited [152,153]. In a review of nine studies, mainly from China, the reported rate of bacterial or fungal coinfections was 8 percent (in 62 of 806); these included mainly respiratory infections and bacteremia [152]. Several reports have described presumptive invasive aspergillosis among immunocompetent patients with ARDS from COVID-19, although the frequency of this complication is uncertain [154-156].Autopsy studies have noted detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA (and, in some cases, antigen) in the kidneys, liver, heart, brain, and blood in addition to respiratory tract specimens, suggesting that the virus disseminates systemically in some cases; whether direct viral cytopathic effects at these sites contribute to the complications observed is uncertain [157,158]. According to the WHO, recovery time appears to be around two weeks for mild infections and three to six weeks for severe disease [159].Laboratory findings — Common laboratory findings among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 include lymphopenia, elevated aminotransaminase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, ferritin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) [57,83,129]. Lymphopenia is especially common, even though the total white blood cell count can vary [57,87,88,160]. As an example, in a series of 393 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City, 90 percent had a lymphocyte count <1500/microL; leukocytosis (>10,000/microL) and leukopenia (<4000/microL) were each reported in approximately 15 percent [129]. Abnormalities in coagulation testing have also been observed; these are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Coagulation abnormalities'.)On admission, many patients with pneumonia have normal serum procalcitonin levels; however, in those requiring ICU care, they are more likely to be elevated [57,87,88].Several laboratory features, including high D-dimer levels and more severe lymphopenia, have been associated with critical illness or mortality [88]. These are discussed elsewhere. (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.)Imaging findings — Chest radiographs may be normal in early or mild disease. In a retrospective study of 64 patients in Hong Kong with documented COVID-19, 20 percent did not have any abnormalities on chest radiograph at any point during the illness [161]. Common abnormal radiograph findings were consolidation and ground glass opacities, with bilateral, peripheral, and lower lung zone distributions; lung involvement increased over the course of illness, with a peak in severity at 10 to 12 days after symptom onset. Although chest CT may be more sensitive than chest radiograph and some chest CT findings may be characteristic of COVID-19, no finding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID-19. In the United States, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends not using chest CT for screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and recommends reserving it for hospitalized patients when needed for management [162]. If CT is performed, the Radiological Society of North America has categorized features as typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19, and has suggested corresponding language for the interpretation report (table 4) [163]. Chest CT in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia [128,164]. Case series have suggested that chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral, have a peripheral distribution, and involve the lower lobes. Less common findings include pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. In a study of 1014 patients in Wuhan who underwent both RT-PCR testing and chest CT for evaluation of COVID-19, a ""positive"" chest CT for COVID-19 (as determined by a consensus of two radiologists) had a sensitivity of 97 percent, using the PCR tests as a reference; however, specificity was only 25 percent [165]. The low specificity may be related to other etiologies causing similar CT findings. In another study comparing chest CTs from 219 patients with COVID-19 in China and 205 patients with other causes of viral pneumonia in the United States, COVID-19 cases were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80 versus 57 percent), ground-glass opacities (91 versus 68 percent), fine reticular opacities (56 versus 22 percent), vascular thickening (59 versus 22 percent), and reverse halo sign (11 versus 1 percent), but less likely to have a central and peripheral distribution (14 versus 35 percent), air bronchogram (14 versus 23 percent), pleural thickening (15 versus 33 percent), pleural effusion (4 versus 39 percent), and lymphadenopathy (2.7 versus 10 percent) [166]. A group of radiologists in that study was able to distinguish COVID-19 with high specificity but moderate sensitivity.As with chest radiographs, chest CT may be normal soon after the onset of symptoms, with abnormalities more likely to develop over the course of illness [127,167]. However, chest CT abnormalities have also been identified in patients prior to the development of symptoms and even prior to the detection of viral RNA from upper respiratory specimens [128,168].Among patients who clinically improve, resolution of radiographic abnormalities may lag behind improvements in fever and hypoxia [169].DIAGNOSISClinical suspicion and criteria for testing — The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with new onset fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea). It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Other consistent symptoms include myalgias, diarrhea, and smell or taste aberrancies (table 3) (see 'Initial presentation' above). Although these syndromes can occur with other viral respiratory illnesses, the likelihood of COVID-19 is increased if the patient:●Resides in or has traveled within the prior 14 days to a location where there is community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; ie, large numbers of cases that cannot be linked to specific transmission chains); in such locations, residence in congregate settings or association with events where clusters of cases have been reported is a particularly high risk for exposure. (See 'Geographic distribution' above and 'Risk of transmission' above.) or●Has had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the prior 14 days, including through work in health care settings. Close contact includes being within approximately six feet (about two meters) of the individual with COVID-19 for more than a few minutes while not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) or having direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing PPE.Patients with suspected COVID-19 who do not need emergency care should be encouraged to call prior to presenting to a health care facility for evaluation. Many patients can be evaluated regarding the need for testing over the phone. For patients in a health care facility, infection control measures should be implemented as soon as the possibility of COVID-19 is suspected. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)If possible, all symptomatic patients with suspected infection should undergo testing; the diagnosis cannot be definitively made without microbiologic testing. However, limited capacity may preclude testing all patients with suspected COVID-19. Local health departments may have specific criteria for testing. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have suggested priorities for testing (table 5); high-priority individuals include hospitalized patients (especially critically ill patients with unexplained respiratory illness) and symptomatic individuals who are health care workers or first responders, work or reside in congregate living settings, or have risk factors for severe disease [170,171]. Testing certain asymptomatic individuals may also be important for public health or infection control purposes (eg, in congregate settings where COVID-19 cases have been identified, prior to time-sensitive surgical procedures, and prior to time-sensitive aerosol-generating procedures if PPE supplies are limited, and in hospitalized patients at locations where prevalence is high [eg, ≥10 percent]). The IDSA also recommends SARS-CoV-2 testing for asymptomatic immunocompromised patients who require hospitalization and for asymptomatic individuals prior to receiving immunosuppressive therapy [172]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Pretransplantation screening'.)Testing criteria suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) can be found in its technical guidance online. These are the same criteria used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk, particularly when no other cause of the symptoms is evident. The management of suspected cases when testing is not available is discussed elsewhere. (See 'COVID-19 testing not readily available' below.)Microbiologic diagnosisNAAT (RT-PCR) to diagnose current infection — The diagnosis of COVID-19 is made by direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), primarily reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [173]. Various RT-PCR assays are used around the world; different assays amplify and detect different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Most target two or more genes, including the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and spike (S) genes, and regions in the first open reading frame, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene [174]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for many different RT-PCR assays [50]; testing is performed by the CDC, local public health departments, hospital laboratories, and certain commercial reference laboratories. These tests have different performance characteristics and times to result (ranging from 15 minutes to several hours) and require different specimen types. The turnaround time for clinicians to receive a result also depends on how often the laboratory performs the test. Point-of-care NAATs have also been developed, although some are less sensitive than laboratory-based tests [175]. Specimen collection — Upper respiratory samples are the primary specimens for SARS-CoV-2 NAAT. In the United States, the CDC recommends collection of one of the following specimens [176]:●Nasopharyngeal swab specimen, collected by a health care professional ●Oropharyngeal swab specimen, collected by a health care professional ●Nasal swab specimen from both anterior nares, collected by a health care professional or by the patient on-site or at home (in the United States, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization for home-collection testing kits that can be mailed to a laboratory for testing [177,178])●Nasal or nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate, collected by a health care professionalHowever, there is uncertainty regarding the optimal upper respiratory tract specimen. The IDSA suggests nasopharyngeal, mid-turbinate, or nasal specimens rather than an oropharyngeal specimen (or saliva) because of limited data suggesting lower sensitivity with oropharyngeal specimens and lack of data on accuracy of saliva specimens [172].Lower respiratory tract specimens are also an option for testing; the IDSA suggests reserving these for hospitalized patients who have an initial negative test on an upper respiratory tract specimen but for whom suspicion for lower respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 infection remains [172]. For lower respiratory tract specimens, expectorated sputum should be collected from patients with productive cough, and tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage should be collected from patients who are intubated. Induction of sputum is not recommended. Additional information on testing and handling of clinical specimens can be found on the CDC website. Infection control practices during specimen collection are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)Data comparing the accuracy of testing from various sites are limited but suggest that test sensitivity may vary by type of specimen. Lower respiratory tract specimens may have higher viral loads and be more likely to yield positive tests than upper respiratory tract specimens [26,33]. In a study of 205 patients with COVID-19 who were sampled at various sites, the highest rates of positive viral RNA tests were reported from bronchoalveolar lavage (95 percent, 14 of 15 specimens) and sputum (72 percent, 72 of 104 specimens), compared with oropharyngeal swab (32 percent, 126 of 398 specimens) [26]. Data from this study suggested that viral RNA levels are higher and more frequently detected in nasal compared with oral specimens, although only eight nasal swabs were tested. Similarly, in another study in which 117 pairs of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens from 12 patients were tested simultaneously, 32 pairs were discordant with one test positive and the other negative: the nasopharyngeal specimen tested positive in 66 percent of those pairs compared with 34 percent for the oropharyngeal specimen [39]. However, other studies have not identified higher viral RNA levels in nasopharyngeal compared with oropharyngeal specimens [37]. Interpretation — A positive NAAT for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, false-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been well documented. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, we suggest repeating the test. Repeat testing is performed 24 to 48 hours after the initial test. In such cases, the WHO and IDSA recommend testing a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has evidence of lower respiratory tract illness [172,179]. Infection control precautions for COVID-19 should continue while repeat evaluation is being performed. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing and concern for false-negative results, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk (residence in or travel to an area with widespread community transmission or known contact). In such cases, particularly for hospitalized patients who have a negative SARS-CoV-2 NAAT, characteristic laboratory or imaging findings can further support the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and be reasons to maintain infection control precautions. Nevertheless, other potential causes of symptoms should also be considered in patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 NAATs. The interpretation of an inconclusive or indeterminate result depends on the specific NAAT performed; the clinician should confer with the performing laboratory about additional testing.The accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 NAAT have not been systematically evaluated, and the sensitivity of testing likely depends on the precise assay, the type of specimen obtained, the quality of the specimen, and duration of illness at the time of testing. In a study of 51 patients who were hospitalized in China with fever or acute respiratory symptoms and ultimately had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test (mainly on throat swabs), 15 patients (29 percent) had a negative initial test and only were diagnosed by serial testing [180]. In a similar study of 70 patients in Singapore, initial nasopharyngeal testing was negative in 8 patients (11 percent) [181]. In both studies, rare patients were repeatedly negative and only tested positive after four or more tests.The likelihood of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA may also vary by the duration of illness [182,183]. In an analysis of seven studies (including two unpublished reports) that evaluated RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or exposure, the estimated rates of false-negative results were 100 percent on the day of exposure, 38 percent on day 5 (estimated as the first day of symptoms), 20 percent at day 8, and 66 percent at day 21 [182]. Heterogeneity across studies and assumptions made in the analysis (eg, about incubation period and time of exposure) reduce confidence in these results. One of the studies included in the analysis used a combination of RT-PCR and an immunoglobulin (Ig)M serologic test to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 and suggested that RT-PCR negative rates were <10 percent on days 1 to 3 of illness, >20 percent at day 6, and >50 percent after day 14; however, these results should also be interpreted with caution, since the serologic test used was not validated for detection of acute infection and IgM tests are frequently falsely positive [183]. Other studies have suggested that viral RNA levels are higher early in the course of infection but that some individuals have detectable viral RNA for several weeks following the onset of symptoms, as discussed elsewhere. (See 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' above.)There are also differences in the limit of detection among the major commercial laboratory RT-PCR assays, and retesting samples on different platforms may yield conflicting results [184]. Additionally, point-of-care NAAT assays may not be as sensitive as laboratory-based tests [175].Test performance by specimen type (eg, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and lower respiratory tract) is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Specimen collection' above.)Serology to identify prior infection — Serologic tests detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, and those that have been adequately validated can help identify patients who have had COVID-19. Serologic tests may also be able to identify some patients with current infection (particularly those who present late in the course of illness), but they are less likely to be reactive in the first several days to weeks of infection, and thus may have less utility for diagnosis in the acute setting [183,185-187]. Additionally, individual results should be interpreted with caution in settings of low seroprevalence, in which even serologic tests that have high specificity still have a low positive predictive value (ie, a positive test may be as likely to reflect a false positive as a true positive) [188]. In the United States, several serologic tests have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA for use by laboratories certified to perform moderate- and high-complexity tests [50]. The FDA highlights that serologic tests should not be used as the sole test to diagnose or exclude active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity and specificity of many of these serologic tests are uncertain; a catalog of these tests can be found at centerforhealthsecurity.org.Detectable antibodies generally take several days to weeks to develop. In a study of 173 patients with COVID-19, the median time from symptom onset to antibody detection (with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] that detects antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein) was 12 days for IgM and 14 days for IgG [185]. In the first week since symptom onset, fewer than 40 percent had detectable antibodies; by day 15, IgM and IgG were detectable in 94 and 80 percent, respectively. The accuracy and time to antibody detection vary with the particular test used. Studies evaluating the specificity of serologic tests in a broad population are lacking; in particular, the rate of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses is a potential concern, and IgM tests are prone to false-positive results.Large-scale serologic screening with validated tests may be able to provide a better sense of the scope of the burden of disease (by identifying people who were not diagnosed by PCR or who may have had asymptomatic or subclinical infection) and also identify individuals who may have immunity to infection; serologic correlates of protective immunity, however, have not been defined. (See 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' above and 'Immunity and risk of reinfection' above.)Other tests●Tests that identify SARS-CoV-2 antigen are under development. Rapid antigen tests are easy to use and can be performed at the point of care, but for respiratory pathogens, they are typically less sensitive than nucleic acid amplification testing (see ""Diagnosis of seasonal influenza in adults"", section on 'Rapid antigen tests'). Several manufacturers are selling rapid, point-of-care antigen tests, and in the United States, the FDA has started to issue emergency use authorizations on such tests [189]. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of false negatives with antigen tests. The WHO had previously cautioned against the use of rapid tests based on antigen testing or antibody detection that have not undergone adequate validation because of concerns regarding false-positive or false-negative results [190].●For safety reasons, specimens from a patient with suspected or documented COVID-19 should not be submitted to clinical laboratories for viral culture. Viral culture is mainly reserved for research purposes. (See 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' above.)Testing for other pathogens — If influenza is circulating in the community, it is reasonable to also test for influenza when testing for SARS-CoV-2, as this could have management implications. However, detection of another viral (or bacterial) pathogen does not necessarily rule out SARS-CoV-2 in locations where there is widespread transmission. Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, including influenza, has been described, but the reported frequency is variable [92,191-193].MANAGEMENT — Home management is appropriate for patients with mild infection (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea) or asymptomatic infection who can adequately self-isolate in the outpatient setting. Management of such patients should focus on prevention of transmission to others and monitoring for clinical deterioration, which should prompt hospitalization. Management of patients who warrant hospitalization consists of ensuring appropriate infection control and supportive care (including oxygenation and potentially ventilatory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome). Investigational approaches are also being evaluated, and should be used in the setting of a clinical trial, whenever available. Management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)PREVENTIONInfection control in the health care setting — In locations where community transmission is widespread, preventive strategies for all individuals in a health care setting are warranted to reduce potential exposures. Additional measures are warranted for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Infection control in the health care setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Personal preventive measures — If community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is present, residents should be encouraged to practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave home. In particular, individuals should avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals. The following general measures are additionally recommended to reduce transmission of infection:●Diligent hand washing, particularly after touching surfaces in public. Use of hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol is a reasonable alternative if the hands are not visibly dirty. ●Respiratory hygiene (eg, covering the cough or sneeze).●Avoiding touching the face (in particular eyes, nose, and mouth). The American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests that people not wear contact lenses, because they make people touch their eyes more frequently [194].●Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that are frequently touched. The CDC has issued guidance on disinfection in the home setting; a list of Environmental Protection Agency-registered products can be found here. These measures should be followed by all individuals, but should be emphasized for older adults and individuals with chronic medical conditions, in particular. For people without respiratory symptoms, the WHO does not recommend wearing a medical mask in the community, since it does not decrease the importance of other general measures to prevent infection and may result in unnecessary cost and supply problems; the WHO also emphasizes that medical masks should be prioritized for health care workers [195]. Recommendations on use of masks by healthy members of the community vary by country [196]. In the United States, the CDC updated its recommendations in early April to advise individuals to wear a cloth face covering (eg, homemade masks or bandanas) when in public settings where social distancing is difficult to achieve, especially in areas with substantial community transmission [197]. Individuals should be counseled to avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth when removing the covering, practice hand hygiene after handling it, and launder it routinely. Clinicians should emphasize that the face covering does not diminish the importance of other preventive measures, such as social distancing and hand hygiene. The rationale for the face covering is primarily to contain secretions of and prevent transmission from individuals who have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection. The CDC also reiterates that the face covering recommendation does not include medical masks, which should be reserved for health care workers.Individuals who are caring for patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 at home should also wear a face cover when in the same room as that patient (if the patient cannot wear a face cover). Individuals who develop an acute respiratory illness (eg, with fever and/or respiratory symptoms) should be encouraged to self-isolate at home (away from other individuals and pets in the household) for the duration of the illness and wear a face cover if they have to be around other people. Some may warrant evaluation for COVID-19. (See 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Isolation at home'.) The efficacy of masks in containing SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)The CDC has included recommended measures to prevent spread in the community on its website. Managing asymptomatic individuals with potential exposure — In areas where SARS-CoV-2 is prevalent, all residents should be encouraged to stay alert for symptoms and practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining six feet (two meters) distance from others when they have to leave the home. In the United States, the CDC suggests this approach for all residents [198]. For those returning from international travel (including cruise ship travel) and those who have had close contact with a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (including during the 48 hours prior to that patient developing symptoms), the CDC also suggests [198,199]:●Self-quarantine at home for 14 days following the last exposure, with maintenance of at least six feet (two meters) from others at all times. ●Avoiding contact with individuals at high risk for severe illness (unless they are household members with the same exposure). (See 'Risk factors for severe illness' above.)●Twice-daily temperature checks with monitoring for fever, cough, or dyspnea. If they develop such clinical manifestations, they should continue to stay at home away from other household members and contact their medical providers. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Management and counseling for all outpatients'.) For asymptomatic individuals who are critical infrastructure workers, the CDC has provided guidance on returning to work during the 14-day post-exposure period with symptom and temperature monitoring, mask use, social distancing, and workspace disinfection [200].Management of health care workers with a documented exposure is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Return to work for health care workers'.) Public health measures — On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread. Throughout the world, countries have employed various nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission. In addition to personal preventive measures (eg, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and face covers, environmental disinfection), transmission reduction strategies include: ●Social/physical distancing orders ●Stay-at-home orders●School, venue, and nonessential business closure●Bans on public gatherings●Travel restriction with exit and/or entry screening●Aggressive case identification and isolation (separating individuals with infection from others)●Contact tracing and quarantine (separating individuals who have been exposed from others)These measures have been associated with reductions in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection over time, although the relative contribution of each is difficult to assess, as most countries have employed a combination of interventions. As an example, in an epidemiologic study in Wuhan, a number of these interventions (implementation of travel restrictions in and around Wuhan with home quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing in public, followed by centralized quarantine for all cases and contacts, followed by proactive symptom screening for all residents) were associated with progressive reductions in the incidence of confirmed cases in Wuhan and a decrease in the effective reproduction number (ie, the average number of secondary cases for each case in a population made up of both susceptible and nonsusceptible individuals) from >3 prior to the interventions to 0.3 after them [201]. In another study from China, cities in which combined control measures were preemptively implemented prior to identification of COVID-19 cases recorded 33 percent fewer laboratory-confirmed cases during the first week of the outbreak compared with cities that implemented control measures later [202]. In a study from the United States evaluating incident cases in bordering counties in Illinois, which issued a stay-at-home order, and Iowa, which did not, the counties in Iowa experienced a more rapid increase in cases following implementation of the order in Illinois, estimated to result in 217 excess cases after one month [203]. For countries where incidence has declined and relaxation of transmission reduction measures is being considered, the WHO has issued interim guidance on implementation, which includes a step-wise approach that is adjusted according to local circumstances and prioritizes protecting vulnerable populations; it recommends that personal preventive measures be maintained and that public health efforts to detect cases for isolation and to identify contacts for quarantine be strengthened [204,205].Specific recommendations on global travel are available on the WHO website. In the United States, the CDC currently recommends that individuals avoid all nonessential international travel and nonessential travel from some domestic locations [206]. Because the risk of travel changes rapidly, travelers should check United States government websites for restrictions. Investigational approachesVaccines — Numerous vaccine candidates are being evaluated for prevention of COVID-19 [207]. These include various types of vaccines, including nucleic acid-based (mRNA and DNA) vaccines, viral-vector vaccines, and inactivated or recombinant protein vaccines [208]. The different vaccine platforms vary in their potential safety and immunogenicity, speed and cost of manufacturing, and other features important for meeting global demand.There is also interest in Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunization for prevention of COVID-19, and clinical trials are underway to evaluate its use among health care workers [209]. Studies have suggested that, although its primary purpose is prevention of tuberculosis, BCG immunization induces a nonspecific immune response that may have protective effects against non-mycobacterial, including viral, infections [210,211]. Any impact of BCG immunization on COVID-19 is unknown. The WHO recommends BCG vaccination not be used for prevention or lessening the severity of COVID-19, pending further data [212]. Post-exposure prophylaxis — Clinical trials are also being conducted in the United States and elsewhere to evaluate the safety and efficacy of post-exposure drug prophylaxis against COVID-19 [213,214]. No agent is known to be effective in preventing infection; we suggest post-exposure prophylaxis not be attempted outside a clinical trial. SPECIAL SITUATIONSPregnant and breastfeeding women — The general approach to prevention, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 is largely similar to that in nonpregnant individuals. Issues specific to pregnant and breastfeeding women are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".) Children — Symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported [115-118]. Details of COVID-19 in children are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".) COVID-19 testing not readily available — In some cases, testing for COVID-19 may not be accessible, particularly for individuals who have a compatible but mild illness that does not warrant hospitalization and do not have a known COVID-19 exposure or high-risk travel history. In the United States, there is limited official guidance for this situation, and the approach may depend on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the area. If the clinician has sufficient concern for possible COVID-19 (eg, there is community transmission and there is no other apparent cause for the symptoms), it is reasonable to assume the patient had COVID-19 and advise the patient to self-isolate at home (if hospitalization is not warranted) and alert the clinician about worsening symptoms. Outpatient management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Management and counseling for all outpatients' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.) SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Since the first reports of COVID-19, infection has spread to include more than five million confirmed cases worldwide, prompting the WHO to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms who reside in or have traveled to areas with community transmission or who have had recent close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. Clinicians should also be aware of the possibility of COVID-19 in patients with severe respiratory illness when no other etiology can be identified. Other symptoms have also been associated with COVID-19 (table 3). Limitations in testing capacity may preclude testing all patients with suspected infection; suggested priorities include hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals who are health care workers or first responders, work or reside in congregate living settings, or have risk factors for severe disease (table 5). (See 'Clinical features' above and 'Diagnosis' above.)●The microbiologic diagnosis is made by a positive nucleic acid amplification test (eg, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) for SARS-CoV-2. An upper respiratory tract specimen is the preferred initial test specimen. If possible, all symptomatic patients with suspected infection should undergo testing. However, because of limited testing capacity and concern for false-negative testing, the diagnosis is often presumptively made based on consistent clinical and epidemiologic features. Serologic tests can help identify individuals with prior infection but have less utility in the first weeks of infection. (See 'Microbiologic diagnosis' above.)●Upon suspicion of COVID-19, infection control measures should be implemented. Infection control in the home and in health care settings is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.) ●Home management is appropriate for patients with mild illness who can adequately self-isolate in the outpatient setting.

(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, individuals should be advised to wash hands diligently, practice respiratory hygiene (eg, cover their cough), and avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals, if possible. Social distancing is recommended in locations that have community transmission. In some locations, face coverings are advised in public settings.

ID:128190,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries globally. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV. The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [2].In children, COVID-19 is usually mild. However, in rare cases, children can be severely affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. In April of 2020, reports emerged from the United Kingdom of a presentation in children similar to incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) or toxic shock syndrome [3,4]. Since then, there have been increasing reports of similarly affected children in other parts of the world [5-8]. The syndrome has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C; also referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome [PMIS], pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome [PIMS], pediatric hyperinflammatory syndrome, or pediatric hyperinflammatory shock).This topic will outline what is known about the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of MIS-C. Other aspects of COVID-19 in children and adults are discussed separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)Understanding of COVID-19 and MIS-C is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the WHO and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5,9,10]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)EPIDEMIOLOGY — While the incidence of MIS-C is unknown, it appears to be a rare complication of COVID-19 in children.The initial reports of MIS-C emerged from the United Kingdom in April, 2020 [3,4]. Since then, there have been reports of similarly affected children in other parts of the world, including Europe, Canada, and the United States (the majority of cases in the United States have been in New York) [5-8,11-13].Many children with MIS-C meet criteria for complete or incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) (see 'Clinical manifestations' below). However, the epidemiology differs from that of classic KD, The pattern that has emerged from the available case series is that most MIS-C cases have occurred in older children and adolescents who were previously healthy [3,6,11]. Black children may be disproportionally affected. By contrast, classic KD typically affects infants and young children and has a higher incidence in East Asia and in children of Asian descent. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology"", section on 'Epidemiology'.)The epidemiology of MIS-C also differs from that of acute COVID-19 illness in children, which tends to be most severe in infants <1 year of age and in children with underlying health problems. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Potential risk factors for severe disease'.)The first report of MIS-C was a series of eight children seen at a tertiary center in South East England [3]. In three subsequent case series from the United Kingdom (n = 37), France (n = 35), and New York (n = 33), the majority of children were previously healthy (95 percent in the United Kingdom series, 89 percent in the French series, and 79 percent in the New York series) [11,14]. The most common comorbidities were obesity and asthma. Boys accounted for approximately 60 percent of cases. The average age was 9 to 11 years (range 1 to 17 years).It is unclear if the risk of developing MIS-C varies by race, though black children account for a disproportionally high number of cases and Asian children account for only a small number of cases in the initial reports. In the United Kingdom series, 46 percent of patients were black, 19 percent white, 11 percent Asian, and 5 percent biracial [11]. In the New York series, 24 percent were black, 27 percent Hispanic, 9 percent white, and 9 percent Asian [11].Based on the patterns seen in the United Kingdom, New York, and Italy, there seems to be a lag of several weeks between the peak of COVID-19 cases within communities to the peak of MIS-C cases [6,11,15]. For example, in London, the peak of COVID-19 cases occurred in the first to second weeks of April, while the peak of MIS-C cases occurred in the first to second week of May [11,15]. This three- to four-week lag coincides with the timing of acquired immunity and suggests that MIS-C may represent a postinfectious complication of the virus rather than acute infection, at least in some children.PATHOPHYSIOLOGY — The pathophysiology of MIS-C is not well understood. It has been suggested that the syndrome results from an abnormal immune response to the virus, with some similarities to Kawasaki disease (KD), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and cytokine release syndrome. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers the abnormal immune response are unknown. A postinfectious process is suggested, based on the timing of the rise of these cases relative to the peak of COVID-19 cases in communities, as discussed above (see 'Epidemiology' above). This is also supported by the finding that many affected children have negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 but have positive serology. However, some children do have positive PCR testing. In early case series from the United Kingdom, New York, and Italy, there were 59 children in whom both PCR and serology were performed [6,11]. Of these, 70 percent had positive serology with negative PCR, 22 percent were positive on both tests, and 8 percent were negative on both tests.Understanding the mechanisms of the exaggerated immune response in MIS-C is an area of active investigation. The pathophysiology of KD, MAS, and cytokine release syndrome are discussed separately. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology"", section on 'Immunologic response' and ""Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"", section on 'Pathophysiology' and ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"", section on 'Pathophysiology'.)CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSPresenting symptoms — In the available case reports, clinical presentations were similar, including [3,6,7,11,14]:●Persistent fevers (median duration four days) – 100 percent●Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea) – 60 to 97 percent●Rash – 50 to 60 percent●Neurocognitive symptoms (headache, lethargy, confusion) – 30 to 58 percent●Respiratory symptoms – 32 to 65 percent●Conjunctivitis – 32 percent●Mucous membrane involvement – 19 percent●Sore throat – 14 percent●Swollen hands/feet – 8 percentGastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea) were particularly common and prominent, with some children mimicking appendicitis [14,16]. Some children have been noted to have terminal ileitis on abdominal imaging and/or colitis on colonoscopy. (See 'Imaging findings' below.)Many patients presented with three to five days of fever, then went on to develop warm shock. Patients presenting with fewer days of fever have been reported. Shock is often refractory to volume resuscitation, requiring vasopressors and, in some cases, mechanical hemodynamic support.Pulmonary involvement was not a prominent feature in most cases, though many children required mechanical ventilation for cardiovascular stabilization. Respiratory symptoms (tachypnea, labored breathing), when present, were most often due to severe shock. Cough was uncommon.Clinical findings — In the available case reports, common clinical findings include [3,6,7,11,14]:●Shock – 60 to 80 percent●Criteria met for complete Kawasaki disease (KD) (table 1) – 50 to 64 percent●Myocardial dysfunction (by echocardiogram or elevated troponin/brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) – 50 to 100 percent●Acute respiratory failure requiring noninvasive or invasive ventilation – 52 to 68 percent●Acute kidney injury (most cases were mild) – 38 to 70 percent●Serositis (small pleural, pericardial, and ascitic effusions) – 24 to 50 percent●Acute hepatic failure – 21 percentLaboratory findings — Laboratory abnormalities noted in the available case series include [3,6,7,11,14,17]:●Abnormal blood cell counts, including:•Lymphocytopenia – 80 to 95 percent•Neutrophilia – 80 to 90 percent•Mild anemia – 70 percent•Thrombocytopenia – 30 to 80 percent●Elevated inflammatory markers, including:•C-reactive protein – 90 to 95 percent•Erythrocyte sedimentation rate – 80 percent•Procalcitonin•D-dimer – 80 to 95 percent•Fibrinogen – 90 percent•Ferritin – 75 percent•Interleukin-6 (IL-6)●Elevated cardiac markers:•Troponin – 60 to 90 percent•BNP or NT-pro-BNP – 90 to 100 percent●Hypoalbuminemia – 73 percent●Mildly elevated liver enzymes – 70 percent●Elevated lactate dehydrogenase – 50 to 60 percent●Hypertriglyceridemia – 70 percentImaging findings — Findings on diagnostic imaging may include [3,6,11,14]:●Echocardiography – Echocardiographic findings may include depressed left ventricular (LV) function and coronary artery (CA) abnormalities, including dilation or aneurysm, mitral valve regurgitation, and pericardial effusion [14]. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of patients have depressed LV function. CA abnormalities are seen in approximately 20 to 50 percent of patients. This is considerably higher than in classic KD, in which the rate of CA involvement is approximately 10 to 15 percent. (See ""Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation"", section on 'Coronary artery abnormalities'.)●Chest radiograph – Many patients had normal chest radiographs. Abnormal findings included small pleural effusions, patchy consolidations, focal consolidation, and atelectasis.●Computed tomography (CT) of chest – Chest CT (when obtained) generally had findings similar to those on chest radiograph. A few patients had nodular ground-glass opacification.●Abdominal imaging – Findings on abdominal ultrasound or CT included free fluid, ascites, and bowel and mesenteric inflammation including terminal ileitis, mesenteric adenopathy/adenitis, and pericholecystic edema [16].CASE DEFINITION — The criteria used for case definition vary slightly between different health agencies (table 2) [5,8,17]. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition requires that the child have severe symptoms requiring hospitalization, whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) case does not. An advantage of the WHO definition is that it provides more detail regarding clinical signs of multisystem involvement. These definitions are likely to change as more information becomes available.CDC case definition — According to the case definition put forth by the United States CDC, MIS-C is defined by meeting all of the following criteria (table 2) [5]:●Age <21 years•A presentation consistent with MIS-C, including all of the following:•Fever >38.0°C for ≥24 hours, or report of subjective fever lasting ≥24 hours•Laboratory evidence of inflammation (eg, elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, D-dimer, ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase, or interleukin-6 [IL-6] level; neutrophilia; lymphocytopenia; and/or hypoalbuminemia)•Severe illness requiring hospitalization•≥2 organ systems involved (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and/or neurologic)●No alternative plausible diagnoses●Recent or current SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure, defined as any of the following:•Positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)•Positive serology for SARS-CoV-2•Positive antigen test•COVID-19 exposure within the four weeks prior to the onset of symptomsPatients who meet these criteria and who also fulfill full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease (KD) should be considered to have MIS-C and should be reported. In addition, MIS-C should be considered in any pediatric death with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.WHO case definition — The case definition put forth by the WHO is as follows (table 2) [8]:●Age 0 to 19 years old, and●Fever for ≥3 days, and●Elevated markers of inflammation (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, or procalcitonin), and●No other obvious microbial cause of inflammation, including bacterial sepsis and staphylococcal/streptococcal shock syndromes, and●Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive reverse transcription PCR [RT-PCR], antigen test, or serology) or contact with an individual with COVID-19, and●Clinical signs of multisystem involvement (at least two of the following):•Rash, bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, or mucocutaneous inflammation signs (oral, hands, or feet)•Hypotension or shock•Cardiac dysfunction, pericarditis, valvulitis, or coronary abnormalities (including echocardiographic findings or elevated troponin/brain natriuretic peptide [BNP])•Evidence of coagulopathy (prolonged prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time; elevated D-dimer)•Acute gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain)Spectrum of disease — As more is learned about COVID-19 and MIS-C in children, it is becoming apparent that the spectrum of disease ranges from mild to severe [11]. Our understanding of the full spectrum, including subphenotypes, is evolving.●COVID-19 without an exaggerated immune response – In most children, COVID-19 causes no or only mild symptoms. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●COVID-19-associated febrile inflammatory state – Some children may present with persistent fevers and mild symptoms (eg, headache, fatigue). Inflammatory markers (especially ferritin) may be elevated, but signs of multisystem involvement are lacking.●COVID-19-associated KD – Some children meet criteria for complete or incomplete KD (table 1) and do not develop shock and multisystem involvement. It is unclear if the incidence of coronary artery (CA) aneurysms is higher in COVID-19-associated KD compared with classic KD. Further study is needed. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis"".)●COVID-19-associated MIS-C – Children with MIS-C have a more severe presentation, with markedly elevated inflammatory markers and multisystem involvement. Cardiac involvement and shock are common, as discussed above. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)It remains unclear how common each presentation is, how frequently children progress from mild to more severe manifestations, and what the risk factors are for such progression. We hope to learn more about the full spectrum of disease as additional cases are reported, and it is likely that the case definitions above (see 'Case definition' above) will change as more information becomes available.EVALUATIONLaboratory testing — The initial laboratory evaluation of a child with suspected MIS-C depends on the presentation.●Moderate to severe – For children with moderate to severe symptoms, we suggest the following:•Complete blood cell count with differential•C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (optional: procalcitonin)•Ferritin level•Liver function tests and lactate dehydrogenase•Serum electrolytes and renal function tests•Urinalysis•Coagulation studies (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer, fibrinogen, antithrombin-3)•Troponin and creatine kinase-MB•Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), or NT-pro-BNP•Cytokine panel (if available)Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, ferritin) are measured at the time of admission and then serially to monitor progression.●Well-appearing – For patients presenting with fever for ≥3 days and who are well-appearing with only mild symptoms suggestive of MIS-C, it is reasonable to perform a more limited evaluation initially. For example, it may be reasonable to start with a complete blood count and C-reactive protein and then obtain additional testing only if these are abnormal.Testing for SARS-CoV-2 — All patients with suspected MIS-C should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, including both serology and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab. As previously discussed, most affected children have positive serology with negative PCR, though some have positive PCRs (see 'Pathophysiology' above). Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Testing for other pathogens — Testing for other viral and bacterial pathogens includes [17]:●Blood culture●Urine culture●Throat culture●Stool culture●Nasopharyngeal aspirate or throat swab for respiratory viral panel●Epstein-Barr virus serology and PCR●Cytomegalovirus serology and PCR●Enterovirus PCR●Adenovirus PCRThis testing is appropriate for children with moderate to severe MIS-C (ie, children who require hospitalization). However, an extensive infectious work-up is generally not necessary in well-appearing children presenting with mild symptoms. In such patients, microbiologic testing should be done as clinically indicated according to the age of the child and his/her specific symptoms (eg, throat culture if the child has sore throat, respiratory viral panel if there are respiratory symptoms). Testing should follow the same general approach as is used for fever evaluation more broadly. (See ""Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age: Evaluation and management"".)Detection of other respiratory pathogens (eg, rhinovirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus) in nasopharyngeal specimens does not exclude COVID-19.Additional testing for other pathogens may be warranted, depending on the geographic location and exposure history. This may include:●Murine typhus●Leptospirosis serologyCardiac testing — In addition to troponin and BNP/NT-pro-BNP levels, the cardiac evaluation of a patient with suspected MIS-C includes a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography. Echocardiography is also recommended for children with documented SARS-CoV-2 who do not meet all criteria for MIS-C but who have either shock or features consistent with incomplete or complete Kawasaki disease (KD).Children and adolescents with mild COVID-19 without signs of systemic inflammation are unlikely to have coronary artery (CA) changes or myocarditis. In such children, echocardiography is generally not necessary but may be considered if there are specific clinical concerns.In children with MIS-C, baseline ECGs may be nonspecific, though arrhythmia and heart block have been described [3,18]. Findings on initial echocardiography may include CA dilation, left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, and pericardial effusion. The CA abnormalities can progress to aneurysm, including giant coronary aneurysms [3].●Echocardiographic evaluation – The echocardiographic evaluation includes the following:•Quantitative assessment of LV size and systolic function (LV end-diastolic volume, ejection fraction)•Qualitative assessment of right ventricular systolic function•CA abnormalities (dilation or aneurysm)•Assessment of valvar function•Evaluation for the presence and size of pericardial effusion•Evaluation for intracardiac thrombosis and/or pulmonary artery thrombosis, particularly apical thrombus in severe LV dysfunction•Strain imaging and LV diastolic function (optional)CA assessment is based on Z-scores, with the same classification schema used in KD (table 3), as discussed separately. (See ""Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation"", section on 'Echocardiography'.)●Timing of follow-up echocardiography – At our center, echocardiography is performed at the time of diagnosis, with follow-up examinations at the following intervals:•In patients who initially have normal function and normal CA dimensions, follow-up echocardiogram is performed one to two weeks post-diagnosis to recheck CA size.•In patients who have CA dilation/aneurysm on initial echocardiogram, echocardiography is repeated every two to three days until CA size is stable and then approximately once a week.•For patients with systolic dysfunction/myocarditis and normal CAs on initial echocardiogram, the echocardiogram is repeated as clinically indicated, including repeat imaging of the CAs with each study.•For patients who had evidence of CA involvement or systolic dysfunction/myocarditis in the acute phase, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be considered at approximately one to three months after the acute illness to assess ventricular function and evaluate for edema, diffuse fibrosis, and scar by myocardial delayed enhancement.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — In children presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with MIS-C, the differential diagnosis is broad and includes other infectious and inflammatory conditions:●Bacterial sepsis – Bacterial sepsis is an important consideration in children presenting with fever, shock, and elevated inflammatory markers. All children with suspected moderate to severe MIS-C should have blood cultures sent, and empiric antibiotics should be administered pending culture results (see 'Antibiotic therapy' below). Certain clinical features can help distinguish MIS-C from bacterial sepsis. For example, cardiac involvement, particularly coronary artery (CA) involvement, is uncommon in bacterial sepsis. Ultimately, microbiologic tests (ie, SARS-CoV-2 testing, bacterial cultures) are necessary to make the distinction. (See ""Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis in children: Definitions, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"".)●Kawasaki disease (KD) – Some children along the MIS-C spectrum meet criteria for complete or incomplete KD (table 1) (see 'Spectrum of disease' above). However, there appear to be some key differences. For example, MIS-C appears to affect older children and adolescents, whereas classic KD typically affects infants and young children. In addition, the risk of CA involvement and myocardial dysfunction may be higher in MIS-C compared with classic KD. KD shock syndrome is well described but not common in the classic KD population, whereas shock seems to be a prominent presentation in MIS-C. Ultimately, the designation of MIS-C versus KD is based on SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing (or with an exposure to an individual with COVID-19) who also fulfill full or partial criteria for KD should be considered to have MIS-C and should receive standard treatments for KD. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis"".)●Toxic shock syndrome – Staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndromes share many similarities with MIS-C (table 4). Microbiologic tests (ie, SARS-CoV-2 testing, bacterial cultures) are necessary to make the distinction. (See ""Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome"" and ""Invasive group A streptococcal infection and toxic shock syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"".)●Appendicitis – As discussed above, many children with MIS-C present with fever associated with abdominal pain and vomiting (see 'Presenting symptoms' above). This can mimic the presentation of acute appendicitis. Abdominal imaging may be necessary to make the distinction. (See 'Imaging findings' above and ""Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"".)●Other viral infections – Other viral pathogens that may manifest with multisystem involvement and/or myocarditis include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and enteroviruses. These viruses rarely cause severe multisystem disease in immunocompetent children. Serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can distinguish these from COVID-19-related MIS-C. (See ""Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection"" and ""Overview of cytomegalovirus infections in children"" and ""Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection"".)●Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) – HLH and MAS are aggressive and life-threatening conditions that have some features in common MIS-C. HLH/MAS are syndromes of excessive immune activation that can occur in previously healthy children (often triggered by an infection) and in children with underlying rheumatologic conditions. Most children with HLH/MAS are acutely ill with multiorgan involvement, cytopenias, liver function abnormalities, and neurologic symptoms. Cardiac and gastrointestinal involvement are less common, and neurologic symptoms are more prominent. The diagnosis of MAS/HLH requires specialized immunologic testing, as discussed separately. (See ""Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"", section on 'Specialized testing'.)●Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – SLE can present with fulminant multisystem illness. Such patients generally have considerable kidney and central nervous system involvement, which are not common features of MIS-C. In addition, though patients with SLE may present acutely with fulminant illness, most report feeling fatigued and unwell for an extended period of time prior to the onset of severe symptoms. This is not the case with MIS-C, in which most children are completely well prior to acute onset of febrile illness. (See ""Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"".)●Vasculitis – Other vasculitides can present with fevers, rash, and elevated inflammatory markers. Rashes seen in COVID-19-associated illness can have an appearance that can mimics vasculitis (eg, pernio [chilblain]-like lesions of acral surfaces, sometimes referred to as ""COVID toes""), but they are not vasculitic. (See ""Vasculitis in children: Evaluation overview"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cutaneous manifestations and issues related to dermatologic care"", section on 'Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19'.)MANAGEMENTSetting of care — Children with moderate to severe signs and symptoms should be admitted to the hospital. The level of care is determined by the severity of illness. Admission to a pediatric intensive care unit is appropriate for children with hemodynamic instability (shock, arrhythmia), significant respiratory compromise, or other potentially life-threatening complications. In the available case series, most patients required pediatric intensive care unit care [3,4,6,11].It may be reasonable to manage select patients with mild symptoms in the outpatient setting. However, given the uncertainty regarding the risk of progression from mild to severe (see 'Spectrum of disease' above), hospital admission is advised for patients who have markedly elevated inflammatory markers so that levels can be monitored until trending down.For children who are managed in the outpatient setting, it is critical to provide instructions for when to seek care and to ensure appropriate follow-up. Most children should have follow-up within 48 hours if persistently febrile. Follow-up should include clinical assessment and repeat laboratory testing.Multidisciplinary care — By definition, MIS-C is a multisystem disease, and care for affected children requires coordination of many different specialties. This may include:●Pediatric infectious disease specialists●Pediatric rheumatologists●Pediatric cardiologists●Pediatric intensivists●Pediatric hematologistsAntimicrobial therapyAntibiotic therapy — MIS-C can present with signs and symptoms that mimic those of septic shock and toxic shock syndrome. Thus, patients presenting with severe multisystem involvement, particularly those with shock, should receive prompt empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy pending culture results. An appropriate empiric regimen consists of ceftriaxone plus vancomycin. Ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam is an alternative regimen, particularly for children with acute kidney injury. Clindamycin is added if there are features consistent with toxin-mediated illness (eg, erythroderma). Antibiotics should be discontinued once bacterial infection has been excluded if the child's clinical status has stabilized. (See ""Septic shock in children: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)"", section on 'Empiric regimens' and ""Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome"", section on 'Empiric therapy'.)Antiviral therapy — The role of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapies (eg, remdesivir) in the management of MIS-C is uncertain. Many patients are polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for SARS-CoV-2, and MIS-C may represent a postinfectious complication rather than active infection (see 'Pathophysiology' above). However, some children do have positive PCR testing and may have current infection. Thus, antiviral therapy may have potential to impact the disease process in some, but not all, patients. Use of antiviral agents is generally limited to children with severe MIS-C manifestations. We advise consultation with an infectious disease specialist to guide decision-making. Choice of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agent, dosing, side effects, and monitoring are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Antiviral therapy for select patients'.)Additional therapy based on presentation — Additional therapy depends on the clinical presentation. These presentations can overlap, and it may be appropriate to provide interventions from more than one category. For example, patients presenting with Kawasaki disease (KD) with associated warm shock should receive treatment for KD (ie intravenous immune globulin [IVIG] and aspirin) and appropriate hemodynamic support (ie, volume expansion and epinephrine).Shock — Children presenting with shock should be resuscitated according to standard protocols (algorithm 1). In the available case series, most children with MIS-C presented with warm shock that was refractory to volume expansion. Epinephrine is the preferred vasoactive agent for the management of warm shock in children. In children presenting with significant ventricular dysfunction, milrinone may be helpful. Management of shock in pediatric patients is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Initial management of shock in children"".)Features of Kawasaki disease — Patients who meet criteria for incomplete or complete KD (table 1) should receive standard therapies for KD, including IVIG, aspirin, and, if there are persistent signs of inflammation or coronary artery (CA) dilation/aneurysm, glucocorticoids. Treatment of KD is summarized in the figure (algorithm 2) and is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis"" and ""Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease"".)Myocardial dysfunction — During the acute inflammatory phase of illness, children with myocardial dysfunction may present with arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise. Serial echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function and monitoring of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin levels can help guide therapy. Management focuses on supportive care to maintain hemodynamic stability and ensure adequate systemic perfusion. IVIG is often used in severe cases when the clinical picture is consistent with myocarditis, though conclusive evidence of benefit is lacking. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential so that arrhythmias are promptly detected and treated. Patients with significant ventricular dysfunction are treated with intravenous diuretics and inotropic agents, such as milrinone, dopamine, and dobutamine. In cases of fulminant disease, mechanical hemodynamic support may be necessary in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or a ventricular assist device. Management of myocarditis is discussed separately. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in children"".)Thrombotic complications — Patients with MIS-C are at risk of experiencing thrombotic complications. For example, patients with KD who have large or giant CA aneurysms are at risk for myocardial infarction. In addition, patients may be at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolus, due to hypercoagulability associated with COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●Patients with features of KD – All patients who meet criteria for complete or incomplete KD should receive antithrombotic therapy, which, at a minimum, includes low-dose aspirin. Additional antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy may be warranted in select patients, depending on the degree of CA dilation, as summarized in the figure (algorithm 3) and discussed separately. (See ""Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Management and prognosis"", section on 'Prevention of coronary thrombosis'.)●Patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction – Systemic anticoagulation may be appropriate for patients with moderate to severe LV dysfunction, as discussed separately. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in children"", section on 'Anticoagulation'.)●Other patients – In patients without KD or significant LV dysfunction, the decision to initiate therapy for prevention of VTE is individualized. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related MIS-C itself should be considered a major risk factor for VTE. VTE prophylaxis is generally appropriate for older children and adolescents hospitalized with moderate to severe MIS-C, provided that bleeding risk is low. In infants and young children, the decision is made on a case-by-case basis, weighing other VTE risk factors and the patient's bleeding risk. When VTE prophylaxis is used, low molecular weight heparin is generally the preferred agent. Nonpharmacologic strategies for VTE prophylaxis (eg, intermittent pneumatic compression devices [size permitting] and early mobilization) are encouraged, but MIS-C-related coagulopathy may merit a higher level of intervention. The approach to VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized children is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism in children: Treatment, prevention, and outcome"", section on 'Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis'.)Adjunctive immune-modifying therapies — The benefits and risks of adjunctive therapies (glucocorticoids, interleukin-1 [IL-1] inhibitors [eg, anakinra, canakinumab], IL-6 inhibitors [eg, tocilizumab], convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients) are uncertain. Consultation with pediatric infectious disease and rheumatology specialists is advised. We make decisions about the use of adjunctive therapies on a case-by-case basis, according to disease severity and markers of inflammation or active SARS-CoV-2 infection.As discussed above, glucocorticoids are appropriate for patients with features of KD who have persistent fever after IVIG or CA dilation/aneurysm (see 'Features of Kawasaki disease' above). In addition, glucocorticoids can be considered for patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS; also called cytokine storm, which is characterized by persistent fever, markedly elevated inflammatory markers [eg, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin] and elevated proinflammatory cytokines [eg, IL-6]). Anakinra, canakinumab, and tocilizumab are alternative options for treatment of CRS in patients who cannot receive glucocorticoids and those who are refractory to glucocorticoids. Such decisions should be made under the direction of a pediatric rheumatologist and should occur in the context of a clinical trial whenever possible. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Others'.)OUTCOME — The prognosis of MIS-C is uncertain, given that it is a new clinical entity and our understanding of the disease is still evolving. Though MIS-C has many similarities to Kawasaki disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome, it is clear that the disease course in MIS-C can be more severe, with most children requiring intensive care interventions. Most children survive, but there have been several deaths reported [3,5,7]. Of the approximately 230 cases of suspected MIS-C reported by mid-May of 2020, there were at least five deaths [7].CASE REPORTING — Health care providers who have cared or are caring for patients younger than 21 years of age meeting MIS-C criteria (table 2) should report suspected cases to their local, state, or territorial health department. Additional information can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website and the World Health Organization (WHO) website.SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately:●(See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)●(See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"".)●(See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)●(See ""Society guideline links: Kawasaki disease"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or email these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient education"" and the keyword[s] of interest.)●Basics topics:•(See ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"".)•(See ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"".)•(See ""Patient education: Kawasaki disease (The Basics)"".)SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children is usually mild. However, in rare cases, children can be severely affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. In April of 2020, reports emerged of a presentation in children similar to Kawasaki disease (KD) or toxic shock syndrome. Since then, there have been increasing reports of similarly affected children around the world. The syndrome has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). (See 'Introduction' above.)●The clinical presentation of MIS-C may include persistent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea), rash, and conjunctivitis. Patients typically present with three to five days of fever, followed by development of shock. Laboratory findings include lymphocytopenia, elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, D-dimer), and elevated cardiac markers (troponin, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]). (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)●Case definitions for MIS-C are summarized in the table (table 2). There appears to be a spectrum of disease. (See 'Case definition' above and 'Spectrum of disease' above.)●The initial evaluation of a child with suspected MIS-C generally includes the following, though a more limited evaluation may be appropriate for children with mild presentations (see 'Evaluation' above):•Laboratory testing:-Complete blood cell count with differential-C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (optional: procalcitonin)-Ferritin level-Liver function tests and lactate dehydrogenase-Serum electrolytes and renal function tests-Coagulation studies (activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio/prothrombin time, D-dimer, fibrinogen, antithrombin-3)-Troponin-BNP-Blood culture-Cytokine panel (if available)•Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including both serology and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis')•Testing for other viral and bacterial pathogens (see 'Testing for other pathogens' above)•Cardiac evaluation including 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography (see 'Cardiac testing' above)●Management of MIS-C includes the following (see 'Management' above):•Multidisciplinary care – By definition, MIS-C is a multisystem disease, and care for affected children requires coordination of many different specialties. Infectious disease and rheumatology specialists should be consulted early. Pediatric cardiologists should be consulted in patients with myocardial dysfunction or signs of KD. (See 'Multidisciplinary care' above.)•Children presenting with shock should be resuscitated according to standard protocols (algorithm 1). (See ""Initial management of shock in children"".)•Empiric antibiotic therapy is appropriate for patients presenting with severe multisystem involvement and particularly those with shock. (See 'Antibiotic therapy' above.)•Use of antiviral therapies (eg, remdesivir) is generally limited to children with severe MIS-C manifestations and should be guided by an infectious disease specialist, preferably in the context of a clinical trial. (See 'Antiviral therapy' above.)•Patients who meet criteria for incomplete or complete KD (table 1) should receive standard therapies for KD, including intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), aspirin, and, in if there are persistent signs of inflammation or coronary artery (CA) involvement, glucocorticoids (algorithm 2). (See ""Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis"" and ""Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease"".)•Management of myocardial dysfunction focuses on supportive care to maintain hemodynamic stability and ensure adequate systemic perfusion. IVIG is often used, though conclusive evidence of benefit is lacking. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential so that arrhythmias are promptly detected and treated. (See 'Myocardial dysfunction' above and ""Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in children"".)•Patients with MIS-C are at risk of experiencing thrombotic complications, and antithrombotic therapy is warranted in many cases (eg, low-dose aspirin in patients with KD, systemic anticoagulation in patients with moderate to severe ventricular dysfunction). (See 'Thrombotic complications' above.)•The benefits and risks of adjunctive therapies (glucocorticoids, IL-1 inhibitors [eg, anakinra, canakinumab], IL-6 inhibitors [eg, tocilizumab], convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients) are uncertain. Consultation with pediatric infectious disease and rheumatology specialists is advised. (See 'Adjunctive immune-modifying therapies' above.)•Children with cardiac dysfunction or CA abnormalities should have follow-up with cardiology after discharge, with serial echocardiography to assess for CA aneurysms. (See 'Cardiac testing' above.)●Health care providers who have cared or are caring for patients younger than 21 years of age meeting MIS-C criteria (table 2) should report suspected cases to their local, state, or territorial health department. Additional information can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website and the World Health Organization (WHO) website. (See 'Case reporting' above.)●The prognosis of MIS-C is uncertain, given that it is a new clinical entity and our understanding of the disease is still evolving. Most children survive, though deaths have been reported. (See 'Outcome' above.)",2020-05-22 02:00:00,UPTODATE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
ID:127978,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cutaneous manifestations and issues related to dermatologic care,"INTRODUCTION — Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), raises many critical issues in dermatology and dermatologic care. Addressing these issues is necessary, yet also challenging, because there are few direct data on which to base recommendations [1].This topic will discuss issues related to dermatologic care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other relevant aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and patient management are discussed in detail separately.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Care of patients with systemic rheumatic disease during the pandemic"".)CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF COVID-19 — Case series from around the world have identified a range of potential dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 [2,3]. The frequency (ranging from 0.2 to 20.4 percent of cases) and timing of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are difficult to ascertain [4-6]. Also unclear is the association of certain skin manifestations with the illness severity [7]. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that in some patients the observed skin findings may represent cutaneous reactions to the numerous treatments used for COVID-19 [7,8].The American Academy of Dermatology's COVID-19 Registry, a collaboration between the American Academy of Dermatology and the International League of Dermatologic Societies, is attempting to collate cases and better define the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 [9]. (See 'Registries' below.)Reported dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 include:●Exanthematous (morbilliform) rash – In several case series, a morbilliform rash predominantly involving the trunk has been reported as the most common cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 [2,3,5,10,11]. The rash has been noted either at the disease onset or, more frequently, after hospital discharge or recovery [5].●Pernio (chilblain)-like acral lesions – Pernio (chilblain)-like lesions of acral surfaces (""COVID toes"") have been described across the age spectrum in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, in the absence of cold exposure or underlying conditions associated with pernio [2,3,12-17]. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of these lesions is still under evolution, though it appears to be a primarily inflammatory process [3,15,17,18]. They present as erythematous-violaceous or purpuric macules on fingers, elbows, toes, and lateral aspect of the feet, with or without accompanying edema and pruritus. Resolution may occur in two to eight weeks.Patients presenting with new-onset, pernio-like lesions that have no other clear cause should be tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For patients that have had these lesions for >4 weeks, immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing may be appropriate, following local guidelines and depending on the quality of available tests. Work-up of other causes of pernio is discussed in greater detail separately. (See ""Pernio (chilblains)"".)There are no treatment guidelines for COVID-19-associated, pernio-like lesions of the feet or hands. However, high-potency topical corticosteroids may be helpful if the lesions are causing discomfort.●Livedo-like/retiform purpura/necrotic vascular lesions – Livedo reticularis, retiform purpura, and livedoid lesions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 [13,19-22]. Retiform purpura and necrotic vascular lesions have been described in three patients with severe pulmonary disease [21]. Histologic and immunohistochemistry studies of skin biopsies revealed a pattern of complement-mediated microvascular injury in both involved and normally appearing skin. Histopathologic findings of thrombotic vasculopathy and/or laboratory coagulation alterations have been demonstrated in patients with severe COVID-19 and acral, ischemic lesions [18,22]. (See ""Approach to the patient with retiform (angulated) purpura"" and ""Livedoid vasculopathy"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●Urticaria – Acute urticaria with or without concomitant fever has been reported as a presenting sign of COVID-19 infection [2,3,5,13,23].●Vesicular (varicella-like) eruptions – There are several reports describing a vesicular-pustular, varicella-like eruption associated with COVID-19 [2,13,24,25]. In a series of 24 patients, an eruption of small papules, vesicles, and pustules appeared 4 to 30 days after the onset of COVID symptoms and resolved in a median of 10 days [26]. A real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from vesicle content performed in four patients yielded negative results. Seventeen of 24 patients were not taking any medications, ruling out a drug reaction.●Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) – An erythematous, polymorphic rash, erythema and/or firm induration of hands and feet, oral mucositis, and conjunctivitis, along with systemic, laboratory, and imaging findings of atypical, severe Kawasaki disease, have been described in a cohort of 10 Italian children during the COVID-19 pandemic [27]. Similar cases have been reported in the United Kingdom [28], the United States, and other countries. Case definitions for MIS-C have been proposed by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (See ""Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology"", section on 'Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children'.)Less frequently reported dermatologic manifestations include papulosquamous eruptions [29], erythema multiforme-like lesions [30,31], dengue-like rashes [32,33], petechiae [34], and gangrene [35].Some infants born to mothers with COVID-19 at birth have had transient rash. In a review of nine small case series from China that included a total of 65 pregnant women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and 67 newborns, two newborns presented with a rash [36]. The rash has been described in one infant as a diffuse, maculopapular eruption that resolved in one day with desquamation and in another as a diffuse, red, miliaria-like eruption that disappeared in 10 days without treatment [37].DERMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS RELATED TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC — Skin injury, mechanical/friction dermatitis, and irritant contact dermatitis due to personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene measures have been reported in the majority of health care workers involved in the direct care of patients with COVID-19 [38].Personal protective equipment-induced skin injury — Health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients or patients potentially infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may spend long hours wearing PPE. The American Academy of Dermatology has released recommendations on preventing and treating occupationally induced dermatologic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.PPE-induced skin injury is common, occurring in 43 to 97 percent of Chinese health care workers [38-40]. Long durations of PPE use (>6 hours per day) increase rates of skin damage [38,39]. Masks, goggles, face shields, and gloves apply pressure, create abrasion, and retain moisture and can injure the nasal bridge, cheek, forehead, and hands [38-40].PPE-induced injuries include desquamation, erythema, maceration, fissuring, papules, and erosions, leading to itching and pain [39]. PPE use can also aggravate underlying skin conditions [41].Prevention of PPE-related injuries has the potential to reduce PPE protocol breaches due to inadvertent adjustment and touching [42]. The use of barrier films or dressings at pressure points before donning PPE may reduce these types of injuries [41,43-46]. However, the effect of these preventive measures on PPE ability to prevent viral spread are not well characterized, and caution is warranted [42,44]. Hand hygiene-related dermatitis — Hand hygiene is considered a key tool against COVID-19. Hand eczema was already an issue among health care workers and is likely to be an even greater problem with higher rates of hand washing and glove use during the pandemic [47].The frequency of irritant contact dermatitis of the hands may be reduced by frequent usage of emollients, washing with lukewarm water instead of hot water, and usage of alcohol-based cleansers when hands are not visibly dirty [41,45,48,49]. Overzealous hand hygiene may cause hand eczema in the general population as well [50].The American Academy of Dermatology has released recommendations on preventing and treating occupationally induced dermatologic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. (See ""Irritant contact dermatitis in adults"" and ""Chronic hand eczema"".)THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC — The COVID-19 pandemic has led to necessary adjustments to the therapeutic approach for some dermatologic diseases. Considerations for immunosuppressive therapy, phototherapy, and skin cancer treatment are reviewed here. Various professional organizations have also released guidelines for clinical care during the pandemic. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Dermatology'.)Use of biologic and other immunosuppressive therapies — Biologic and immunosuppressive therapies play important roles in the management of a wide variety of dermatologic diseases, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and other inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. The risks of these immunomodulatory therapies in relation to COVID-19 remain unclear. Although it is generally accepted that most patients without COVID-19 who are already taking immunosuppressive drugs for dermatologic disease can continue therapy, a more cautious approach is typically taken for patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and patients who are considering starting a new immunosuppressive therapy. (See 'Patients without COVID-19' below and 'Patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19' below.)Assessment of risk — The uncertainty regarding the impact of biologic and other immunosuppressive therapies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection risk and COVID-19 severity makes risk assessment challenging [51-53]. Specific challenges for risk assessment include the paucity of data, the various mechanisms of action of immunosuppressive drugs, and the need to consider patient-specific and disease-specific morbidity and comorbidities. Some authors have proposed that the broad immunosuppression induced by small molecule immunosuppressants (eg, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine) may be of greater concern than the targeted immunosuppression induced by biologic drugs; however, the relative safety of individual immunosuppressants remains unclear [54].Consideration of the potential risks of immunosuppressive therapy must also be balanced with consideration of the detrimental effects on skin disease and associated conditions that may result from cessation of effective therapies [55]. Cutaneous disease may flare, and occasional patients may not achieve the same level of response upon the reintroduction of a previously effective biologic therapy [52,53]. Of note, the long half-lives of some biologic agents mean that immunosuppressive effects of concern may still persist for some time following the decision to stop therapy.Studies evaluating use of immunomodulatory therapies in relation to COVID-19 in patients with dermatologic disease are limited and insufficient for drawing conclusions on risk in this population [56-58]. It is unclear whether data from clinical trials that have assessed risk for upper respiratory infections during biologic therapy for dermatologic disease are applicable to SARS-CoV-2 infection [53,59-61].In support of the theory that risks of continuing biologic therapy for skin disease may be low, one retrospective study of 5206 patients in northern Italy treated with biologic agents for plaque psoriasis between February 20 and April 1, 2020, found no COVID-19-related deaths and only four COVID-19-related hospitalizations [56]. In addition, a case control study performed in the Lombardy region of Italy that involved assessment of 1193 patients with psoriasis treated with biologic or small molecule therapy and approximately 10 million controls between February 21 and April 9, 2020, found higher risks for testing positive for COVID-19, being self-quarantined at home due to COVID-19, or being hospitalized due to COVID-19 among psoriasis patients receiving biologic therapy compared with controls but did not find statistically significant increases in risk for intensive care unit admission or dying in this population [57].Although the potential for a beneficial effect of biologic inhibitors tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or interleukin (IL) 17 in COVID-19 has been proposed based upon the theory that some immunosuppressive drugs might have inhibitory effects on damaging immune response that is thought to contribute to organ damage in COVID-19, this has not been proven [62-65]. Data on IL-6 pathway inhibitors is reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)Patients without COVID-19 — Decisions on the use of immunosuppressive therapies in patients without signs or symptoms of COVID-19 during the global pandemic should be made on a case-by-case basis and in conjunction with the patient. This may involve review of the patient's comorbidities, severity of the disease originally being treated, limited available data, expert opinion, local recommendations, and patient preference.Continuation of immunosuppressive therapies — Based upon an absence of evidence that suggests benefit of discontinuing immunosuppressive therapies in patients without COVID-19 and the potential detrimental effects of discontinuing effective therapies, the continuation of biologic and small molecule immunosuppressants for dermatologic disease is generally considered a safe and appropriate option for patients who do not have suspected or documented COVID-19. Examples of societies that support this approach include the American Academy of Dermatology [66], National Psoriasis Foundation [67], International Psoriasis Council [68], British Academy of Dermatology [69], and International League of Dermatological Societies [70].Initiation of immunosuppressive therapies — Routine avoidance of initiating a new immunosuppressive therapy for dermatologic disease in patients without COVID-19 is not considered necessary. However, given that some uncertainty remains regarding the effects of immunosuppressive therapies on COVID-19, the decision to start a new immunosuppressive drug for dermatologic disease should be taken carefully, involving a case-specific review of the potential risks and benefits of therapy. In particular, for patients perceived to be at increased risk for severe COVID-19, it may be prudent to consider deferring immunosuppressive treatments in favor of other therapies [66]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)Some authors have proposed testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection or immunity prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapies [71]. However, the value of this approach is unclear.Patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 — Active infection is an accepted indication for discontinuation and avoidance of initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. Some professional societies, including the American Academy of Dermatology, have issued statements that recommend discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs in patients who develop COVID-19, although this remains an area of debate [72]. This approach may be the appropriate default for most patients with confirmed COVID-19. Immunosuppressive therapy may be resumed, if needed, following complete recovery from COVID-19.However, given the uncertainty about the effects of various immunosuppressants on the course of COVID-19, the decision to discontinue treatment in a patient with COVID-19 should be made on a case-by-case basis. Other factors that may influence the decision to cease treatment may include the severity of COVID-19, the potential that biologic treatment may reduce risk of cytokine storm, and the potential negative ramifications of treatment cessation on flaring immunologic activity, including both dermatologic disease and comorbidities.Phototherapy — In-office phototherapy typically involves frequent clinic visits, potentially increasing exposure of patients and clinical staff to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the risks and benefits of office-based phototherapy should be weighed carefully for individual patients. Home phototherapy is an alternative that may be the preferred method of phototherapy during the pandemic but may not be feasible for all patients. If in-office phototherapy is necessary, careful precautions, including screening for symptoms, limiting visitors, personal protective equipment (PPE) use, and equipment disinfection, should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of infection [73,74]. Alternatives to phototherapy should also be considered. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Skin cancer — Many full body skin examinations, biopsies, and skin cancer excisions are being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Triage and management strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic for melanoma, advanced squamous cell carcinoma, and advanced basal cell carcinoma have been developed by several groups, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the European Society for Medical Oncology, and the American College of Mohs Surgery, with deferment of surgery or prompt surgery dependent upon the type of lesion and reason for the visit [75-77]. The United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium has published recommendations for the treatment of cutaneous lymphomas during the COVID-19 pandemic [78].For patients with advanced melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers who are under treatment, there are no recommendations to cease skin cancer-related systemic therapies [79,80]. However, the decision regarding the continuation or initiation of systemic targeted therapies or immunotherapies must be made on a case-by-case basis, after careful evaluation of benefits versus risks.General and specific issues related to the care of cancer patients during the pandemic are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)DELIVERY OF CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC — Local guidelines on the performance of routine, nonurgent medical care during the pandemic differ and continue to evolve. In many settings, the pandemic has led to increased use of telemedicine for dermatologic care (ie, teledermatology). In scenarios in which in-person care remains necessary or appropriate, precautions to limit risk for transmission of infection are indicated. (See 'Telemedicine' below and 'In-person care' below and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Dermatology'.)Telemedicine — Telemedicine provides an opportunity to provide care while reducing risk for exposure of clinicians, staff, and patients to individuals with COVID-19 [81,82]. Both synchronous (eg, simultaneous, two-way communication between the patient and clinician via telephone or videoconferencing) and asynchronous (eg, store-and-forward transmission of images for later assessment by the clinician) modalities have been utilized for teledermatology care [83]. A structured triage process may be helpful for identifying patients who require in-person, rather than a telemedicine, visit [84,85]. Telemedicine may also be an appropriate option for inpatient dermatologic care in some scenarios. The Society of Dermatology Hospitalists has produced an algorithm to guide triaging of consultations and the performance of safe inpatient dermatologic care [86]. Concerns have been raised over privacy and security of telemedicine [87,88]. The platform selected should be compliant with local privacy regulations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some regulatory bodies have relaxed or waived rules to allow more flexibility in telemedicine [89].In-person care — In-person visits should be performed with appropriate infection control precautions. This typically includes at least patient screening and use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) [90-92]. Best practices for infection control in the clinical setting are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Although the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through procedures such as dermoscopy remains unclear, clinicians should be cognizant about the potential for transmission through equipment that may come into contact with multiple patients. In regards to dermoscopy, noncontact dermoscopy is the preferred form of dermoscopy during the pandemic. Examples of additional suggestions for reducing risk for disease transmission through dermoscopy have included disinfection of the dermatoscope with alcohol for at least one minute prior to and following examination, use of polyvinyl chloride food wrap or glass slide between the lens and lesion, use of alcohol gel as an interface medium, and use of disposable dermoscopic lens covers [93-95].REGISTRIES — Multiple registries have been developed, with the goal of increasing knowledge of the dermatologic manifestations and impact of COVID-19 in patients with dermatologic disease. Examples include:●General dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 or patients with any pre-existing dermatologic condition:•American Academy of Dermatology/International League of Dermatological Societies COVID-19 Registry●Psoriasis:•Psoriasis Registry for Outcomes, Therapy, and Epidemiology of COVID-19 Infection (PsoPROTECT)•Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Under Research Exclusion Registry (SECURE-Psoriasis Registry)●Atopic dermatitis:•Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Under Research Exclusion Registry (SECURE-AD Registry)●Alopecia:•Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Under Research Exclusion Registry (SECURE-Alopecia Registry)●Hidradenitis suppurativa:•Global Hidradenitis Suppurativa COIVD-19 Registry●Acral changes in the pediatric population:•COVID Acral Ischemia/Perniosis in Children RegistryDisease registries for rheumatologic diseases are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Care of patients with systemic rheumatic disease during the pandemic"", section on 'Disease registries'.)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Multiple skin manifestations have been described in patients with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These include a morbilliform rash; urticaria; pernio-like, acral lesions; livedo-like, vascular lesions; and vesicular, varicella-like eruptions. A severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome with mucocutaneous, systemic, laboratory, and imaging findings of atypical, severe Kawasaki disease has also been reported in children and adolescents with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). (See 'Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19' above.)●Skin injury, mechanical/friction dermatitis, and hand irritant contact dermatitis due to personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene measures have been reported in the majority of health care workers involved in the care of patients with COVID-19. Use of barrier films or dressings at pressure points of PPE and frequent use of emollients after hand washing may help reduce skin damage and irritation. (See 'Dermatologic conditions related to COVID-19 pandemic' above.)●The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the need to adjust aspects of dermatologic care. Examples include adjustments in the approach to immunosuppressive treatment, phototherapy, skin cancer treatment, and routine clinical care. (See 'Therapeutic considerations during the pandemic' above and 'Delivery of care during the pandemic' above.)●The impact of immunosuppressive therapies for dermatologic disease on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk for complications of COVID-19 is unclear. The decision to continue or start immunosuppressive therapy for dermatologic disease during the pandemic should be made on a case-by-case basis. Examples of important factors to consider include the patient's infection status, the immunosuppressant under consideration, and the impact of treatment cessation on the dermatologic disease and comorbidities. (See 'Therapeutic considerations during the pandemic' above.)●Given the absence of evidence indicating benefit of discontinuing immunosuppressive therapies in patients without COVID-19, continuation of immunosuppressive therapy for dermatologic disease is considered a safe and appropriate option for this population. The decision to start a new immunosuppressive drug should include careful consideration of potential risks and benefits of therapy. For patients with risk for severe COVID-19, it may be appropriate to defer immunosuppressive treatments in favor of other therapies. (See 'Patients without COVID-19' above.)●Active infection is an accepted indication for discontinuation and avoidance of initiation of immunosuppressive therapies, and some professional organizations, including the American Academy of Dermatology, have issued statements recommending discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs for cutaneous disease in patients who develop COVID-19. Given the paucity of evidence on risks and benefits of discontinuation, the decision to continue or discontinue immunosuppressive treatment in patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 may be made on a case-by-case basis. If discontinued, immunosuppressive therapies may be resumed upon complete recovery form COVID-19. (See 'Patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19' above.)●The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased use of telemedicine for routine clinical care. When in-person visits are performed, appropriate infection control precautions should be implemented.

ID:127965,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to gastrointestinal disease in adults,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily manifests as a lung infection with symptoms ranging from those of a mild upper respiratory infection to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. COVID-19 disproportionately affects patients with pre-existing comorbidities and/or older adults. All medical professionals, including gastroenterology and hepatology clinicians, are tasked with rapidly adjusting their practice to curtail the spread of COVID-19, while providing care to their patients.This topic will discuss COVID-19-related issues for patients with gastrointestinal and liver disease. As understanding of COVID-19 illness continues to evolve, the approach to diagnosis and management may require modification as well. Other important aspects of COVID-19 infection are discussed in detail separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".) ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)POSSIBLE RISK FACTORS FOR COVID-19 — Some patients with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) or liver disease may be at increased risk for COVID-19 and for more severe illness. Potential risk factors in these patients include their chronic inflammatory disease, comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus), immune-modifying therapies, and the need for regular office, endoscopy center, or laboratory visits. These patient groups include [1]:●Patients with cirrhosis●Patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease (eg, primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis)●Liver transplantation recipients [2] (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"")For patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), preliminary data have suggested that the prevalence of COVID-19 is not higher than that of the general population [3-6]. The risk of COVID-19 for patients on biologic therapy for chronic inflammatory diseases (eg, IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis) is uncertain [5]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)The gastrointestinal tract may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection because of widely expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the intestine [7]. ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus, and digestive symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by direct viral attack as well as tissue and organ damage due to the immune response [8,9]. Staining of tissue specimens from patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that the positive areas were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of gastric and intestinal epithelial cells and the cilia of glandular epithelial cells [8]. In addition, viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in the cytoplasm of gastric, duodenal, and rectal glandular epithelial cells. However, understanding of the pathogenesis of digestive disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving, and its effects on existing chronic GI disorders remains uncertain [10].CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTINGSymptoms of disease flare that can mimic COVID-19 — The clinical presentation of several gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases (eg, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hepatitis) can mimic COVID-19 infection [11]. Examples include diseases that manifest with diarrhea, anorexia, and acute hepatitis and/or abnormal liver biochemical and function tests [12]. Thus, for patients with an existing diagnosis of chronic GI or liver disease, the clinician will need to assess whether symptoms are related to a disease flare or COVID-19. The approach to testing for COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Digestive symptoms — Patients with COVID-19 typically present with fever and respiratory symptoms; however, gastrointestinal symptoms have been commonly reported in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 [7,12-15]. For example, in a study including 318 adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, 195 patients (61 percent) reported at least one digestive symptom, and the most frequently reported symptoms were anorexia in 110 patients (35 percent), diarrhea in 107 patients (34 percent), and nausea in 84 patients (26 percent) [13]. Similarly, in another study of 204 patients with COVID-19, 103 patients (51 percent) reported at least one digestive symptom, and the most commonly reported symptoms were anorexia and diarrhea [12]. Some patients with COVID-19 have presented with isolated GI symptoms that may precede the development of respiratory symptoms [16,17]. As an example, in a study of 1141 patients with COVID-19, 183 patients (16 percent) presented with GI symptoms (eg, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) in the absence of respiratory complaints [16]. Limited data have suggested that diarrheal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 have been associated with virus RNA in stool [14,18,19]. In a study of 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, stool samples from patients with diarrhea had higher rates for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA by real time polymerase chain reaction compared with patients without diarrhea (69 versus 17 percent) [18]. Hepatic manifestations — The clinical presentation of COVID-19 may include hepatic manifestations such as acute hepatitis and abnormal liver biochemical and function tests [20]. When to test for COVID-19 in patients with GI symptoms — The diagnosis of COVID-19 is suspected primarily in patients with the new onset of fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea), while other consistent symptoms include myalgias, diarrhea, and aberrancy in sense of smell or taste. For patients with GI symptoms, we favor testing for COVID-19 in the following cases [21]:●Hospitalized patients with the new onset of GI symptoms●Outpatients with the new onset of GI symptoms for over 48 hours●Patients with established GI disease (eg, Crohn disease) with symptoms suggestive of a disease flare (eg, diarrhea, vomiting) In a minority of patients, GI symptoms such as diarrhea may be the presenting symptom or may precede the development of respiratory symptoms [16,17,21]. While the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be suspected based on presenting symptoms, additional factors that inform the decision to perform testing include the patient's geographic location, risk of exposure, rate of community transmission, and the availability of testing. The epidemiology and diagnosis of COVID-19 are discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Additionally, stool testing to exclude Clostridioides (C., formerly Clostridium) difficile infection is obtained for patients with diarrhea who are at risk for C. difficile infection (eg, recent antibiotic use) or who may require therapy (eg, antidiarrheal agents) to control symptoms. (See 'Managing symptoms related to viral infection' below.)Managing symptoms related to viral infection — For symptomatic therapy for infectious diarrhea, the antidiarrheal agent loperamide can be used in an initial dose of 4 mg and with a maximum daily dose of 16 mg in patients without fever, bloody stools, or risk factors for C. difficile infection. Use of loperamide for patients with acute diarrhea is discussed separately. (See ""Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings"", section on 'Management'.)For patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis (eg, nausea, vomiting), antiemetic drugs can often help relieve symptoms, in addition to supportive measures including oral or intravenous hydration. Management of patients with gastroenteritis and use of antiemetics are discussed separately. (See ""Acute viral gastroenteritis in adults"", section on 'Treatment' and ""Characteristics of antiemetic drugs"".) Symptomatic therapy for digestive symptoms may reduce the risk of complications such as electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypokalemia) or colonic ischemia related to volume depletion. (See ""Colonic ischemia"".)Specific management for COVID-19 is discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".). MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLESGeneral strategies to reduce risk of infection — If community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus is present, preventive measures to reduce exposure to the virus include (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Prevention'):●General preventive measures such as hand hygiene and social distancing.●Use of telemedicine visits for ongoing disease management.●Decreased frequency of routine laboratory and imaging surveillance when the associated risk is deemed to be low. ●Delay nonurgent endoscopic procedures (eg, colorectal cancer screening) (see 'Implications for endoscopy' below). ●Use of lower-volume laboratories off-site from larger healthcare facilities.●For patients with stable disease and without known or suspected COVID-19, continuing the established medication regimen to avoid a disease flare that may result in the need for diagnostic testing and/or inpatient hospitalization.●For patients on glucocorticoids, therapy should not be abruptly discontinued, but should be used at the lowest dose possible to control the underlying disease, regardless of COVID-19 exposure or infection status.Inflammatory bowel diseaseDiagnostic considerations during pandemic — For patients with symptoms of active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (eg, diarrhea) who are also at risk for COVID-19 (eg, recent exposure, high rate of community transmission), evaluation includes COVID-19 testing, stool studies to exclude enteric infections (eg, C. difficile infection), noninvasive inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin), and serum drug trough levels (for patients on biologic therapy). (See ""Treatment of Crohn disease in adults: Dosing and monitoring of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors"", section on 'Monitoring' and ""Overview of dosing and monitoring of biologic agents and small molecules for treating ulcerative colitis in adults"".)However, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus, nonspecific markers of inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein) may be elevated due to COVID-19 rather than IBD. (See ""Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn’s disease in adults"" and ""Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults"".) If fecal markers (eg, fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin) are not elevated, endoscopic evaluation is not necessary, as negative test results indicate the absence of active bowel inflammation. For most patients with an established diagnosis of IBD, elevated fecal inflammatory marker levels along with typical symptoms of active disease (eg, diarrhea) in the absence of infection are sufficient to initiate IBD treatment. (See ""Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis"", section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'.)Urgent endoscopic evaluation is reserved for patients in whom the results will change management [6]. For example, patients with suspected severe acute ulcerative colitis are typically started on glucocorticoids intravenously but still require at least a limited lower endoscopy with biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other conditions (eg, viral infection). (See ""Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis"", section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'.) Patients without COVID-19Patients with IBD in remission — Available data have suggested that patients with IBD in remission are not at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and that such patients should continue maintenance therapy to sustain remission [3,4,6]. Discontinuing maintenance therapy has been associated with disease relapse that may require hospitalization and/or glucocorticoid therapy, and thus, increase the risk of COVID-19 [3,22].Therapies for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn disease are discussed separately. (See ""Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults"", section on 'Maintenance of remission' and ""Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease"", section on 'Maintenance therapy'.)Therapies for maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis are discussed separately. (See ""Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis"", section on 'Maintenance of remission' and ""Management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults"", section on 'Maintenance of remission'.)Patients with active IBD — For patients with a flare of Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis in the absence of COVID-19, adding or escalating anti-inflammatory or biologic therapy may be required for symptomatic improvement and inducing remission. (See 'Diagnostic considerations during pandemic' above.) For example, therapeutic options for mild IBD include oral budesonide, aminosalicylates, and topical (rectal) therapy, while options for moderately to severely active IBD include biologic therapies (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents, anti-integrin agents, and anti-interleukin agents) [6]. The approach to using these therapies has not changed during the pandemic. However, if systemic glucocorticoids are deemed necessary for patients with active IBD during the pandemic, the lowest dose of glucocorticoid that will result in clinical response is used for a short duration before transitioning to another therapy that is glucocorticoid-sparing [6]. For example, management of a patient who is hospitalized with severe ulcerative colitis in the absence of COVID-19 may include treatment with a glucocorticoid (eg, methylprednisolone 16 to 20 mg intravenously every eight hours) for three days, and if there is no clinical response, medical therapy is escalated to infliximab [6,23]. Surgery is an alternative option for patients who do not improve with medical therapy. Additionally, in the COVID-19 era, the initial use of infliximab at a dose of 5 mg/kg rather than glucocorticoid therapy is a reasonable approach. Management of hospitalized patients with ulcerative colitis including escalating medical therapy is discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis"".)Diagnosis, pretreatment assessment, and medical management of Crohn disease are discussed separately:●(See ""Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn’s disease in adults"".)●(See ""Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults"".)●(See ""Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease"".)Diagnosis, pretreatment assessment, and medical management of ulcerative colitis are discussed separately:●(See ""Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults"".)●(See ""Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis"".)●(See ""Management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults"".)●(See ""Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis"".)Patients with COVID-19Adjusting IBD medications — Adjustments to medication regimens in patients with IBD with suspected or known COVID-19 should be individualized based on the severity of infection, patient comorbidities, and the existing medication regimen. Expanding indications for SARS-CoV-2 testing (eg, screening prior to endoscopy) may result in increased identification of asymptomatic patients who are infected [6]. The goal of medication adjustment is to reduce immunosuppression during active viral infection to lower the risk of COVID-19-related complications (eg, pneumonia) [24]. Our overall approach for patients with IBD in remission includes [25-27] (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults""):●Therapies that can be continued without interruption:•Budesonide.•Aminosalicylates.•Topical rectal therapy (eg, topical glucocorticoid).•Antibiotics.●Therapies requiring adjustment:•Systemic glucocorticoids – Reduce dose of systemic glucocorticoid (eg, prednisone dose to <20 mg daily) or transition to oral budesonide. (See ""Overview of budesonide therapy for adults with inflammatory bowel disease"".)Although systemic glucocorticoids convey an increased risk of infections, abrupt discontinuation is not possible, and patients should receive the lowest required dose for the shortest period of time necessary to minimize adverse reactions. (See ""Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids"".)•Immunomodulators – Discontinue thiopurines (ie, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) and methotrexate. •Tofacitinib – Discontinue tofacitinib, a small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor because it has been associated with an increased risk of other viral infections (ie, herpes zoster infection) and its mechanism of action is to suppress T-cell function. (See ""Management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults"", section on 'Tofacitinib'.) •Biologic agents – Discontinue biologic therapy (anti-TNF agents, ustekinumab, or vedolizumab).Resumption of therapy — The optimal time to resume immunosuppressive medications after SARS-CoV-2 infection is uncertain, while expert consensus has stated that medications can be resumed after negative testing for COVID-19 and/or a symptom-free observation period of 14 days. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Preliminary data suggested that induction therapy for active ulcerative colitis in the setting of recent mild COVID-19 was not associated with an increased risk for progressing to severe infection. In a case report of a 54-year-old female patient with mild COVID-19 and active ulcerative colitis, treatment with infliximab at weeks 6 and 7 following the diagnosis was associated with achieving clinical remission and recovery from COVID-19 [28]. Prognosis — Case series including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and chronic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, IBD) have provided preliminary outcome data [5,28]. As an example, in a study of 86 patients with COVID-19 in the setting of immune-mediated inflammatory disease (including 37 patients with IBD), 14 patients (16 percent) required hospitalization, and the mortality rate was 7 percent [5]. In another study of 40 patients with IBD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 11 patients (28 percent) on immunomodulators and seven patients (18 percent) on biologic monotherapy, 21 patients (53 percent) were hospitalized, but none required intensive care unit admission [28]. However, two patients with ulcerative colitis (5 percent) died from complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome; both of these patients were older (ie, >75 years of age), and one patient had been on methotrexate.DISEASE REGISTRIES — Data on patients with chronic gastrointestinal or liver disease who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus are accumulating, and disease-specific patient registries include:●SECURE-IBD registry – The SECURE-IBD registry is an international database that collects data on disease severity and outcomes for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus [29]. The available data have suggested that hospitalization rates have been highest among patients with moderately to severely active IBD, which emphasizes the importance of treating active inflammation. (See 'Patients with COVID-19' above.)●SECURE-Cirrhosis registry – The SECURE-Cirrhosis registry is an international database that collects data on disease severity and outcomes for patients with chronic liver disease (ie, cirrhosis, liver transplantation recipients) [30].IMPLICATIONS FOR ENDOSCOPY — During the COVID-19 pandemic, nonurgent endoscopic procedures have been deferred with a goal of reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, conserving personal protective equipment, and reserving clinical resources for managing patients with COVID-19. The decision to perform endoscopic procedures and the necessary protocols are informed by state, local, and institutional rules in addition to guidance from professional societies [31,32]. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Gastroenterology and hepatology'.)Indications for elective procedures that should be delayed, in addition to indications for urgent or emergent procedures that should not be delayed, can be found on the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy website.Strategies for reducing the risk of transmitting infection during gastrointestinal endoscopy that have been endorsed by professional societies, including the use of personal protective equipment, can be accessed here.Infection control strategies for use during aerosol-generating procedures (eg, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP], endoscopic ultrasound) are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)The approach to managing some patients with acute gastrointestinal (GI) and liver disease has been modified because of the COVID-19 pandemic [33]: ●Patients with GI bleeding – Early reports suggest that GI bleeding is a common indication for gastroenterology consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic, while strategies to use medical therapy and delay endoscopic evaluation have been developed [34,35]. Some centers have suggested medical therapy for patients with suspected nonvariceal upper GI bleeding including continuous intravenous proton pump inhibitor, antiemetics, and optimizing coagulation status [34]. For example, in a series of six patients with acute upper GI bleeding and COVID-19 pneumonia, management included intravenous proton pump inhibitor and clinical observation, and no patients required urgent endoscopy during their hospitalization [35]. Rationale for this conservative approach also includes data that have suggested that delaying endoscopy for 24 hours was not associated with increased mortality in patients with acute upper GI bleeding [36]. For most patients with lower GI bleeding in the setting of COVID-19, endoscopic evaluation can be initially delayed and then performed on an outpatient basis after resolution of the acute illness [34]. Timing of endoscopy for patients with GI bleeding is discussed separately. (See ""Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults"" and ""Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults"".)●Patients with acute cholangitis or biliary obstruction – Strategies for managing patients who have acute cholangitis and/or obstructive jaundice are informed by available resources (eg, endoscopy space, nursing, and anesthesia services), the patient's hemodynamic status and location (eg, intensive care unit) and the availability of alternatives to ERCP (eg, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, initial medical management) [34,37]. Management of acute cholangitis is discussed in more detail separately.

ID:127582,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation,"INTRODUCTION — Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for COVID-19 because they are immunosuppressed and have frequent contact with the health care system. There is also a theoretical risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) with organ transplantation, although no cases of organ transplant-transmitted infection have been described to date.This topic reviews aspects of COVID-19 that are specific to solid organ transplantation, including screening prior to transplantation, distinct clinical features, managing immunosuppression, and important drug interactions. Other aspects of COVID-19 care are discussed separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)RISK OF TRANSMISSIONPotential for donor-derived infection — The risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from an organ donor to a recipient is theoretical and based upon the detection of viral RNA in organs that can be transplanted (eg, lung, heart, kidney, intestine) and in other sites (ie, blood, urine) [1-4]. While it is clear that viable infectious virus can be cultured from the lung and other parts of the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, additional study is needed to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 detected at extra-respiratory sites is intact, replication competent, and therefore transmissible by non-lung organ transplantation.To date, no organ donor-derived infections have been reported. Similarly, bloodborne transmission has not been reported and is not expected; both the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 viremia and its magnitude are low [1,4-6]. (See ""Blood donor screening: Medical history"", section on 'SARS-CoV-2 (no evidence of transfusion-transmitted infection)'.)Posttransplantation risk — It is not known whether solid organ transplant recipients are at higher risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population. However, chronic immunosuppression may lower the infectious dose needed to cause COVID-19 and impair adequate immune control once infection is established. Organ transplant recipients also have frequent contact with the health care system and are therefore potentially more likely to be exposed to the virus.Like other immunosuppressed persons, solid organ transplant recipients may shed greater amounts of virus for longer durations than otherwise healthy hosts. Thus, they may be more likely to spread infection to others. Further data is needed to confirm these theories and to quantify viral dynamics and transmission risks in the solid organ transplant population.DEFERRAL OF NONURGENT TRANSPLANTATION — To minimize the risk of infection and conserve hospital resources, elective transplantation (eg, living-donor kidney transplantation) and nonurgent, deceased-donor transplantation are being deferred at some transplant centers where the community prevalence of COVID-19 is high and/or where resources (personnel, hospital or intensive care unit [ICU] beds, operating rooms, other equipment) are limited [7].Life-saving transplantation continues to be performed, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have classified organ transplantation as a tier 3b activity: Do not delay, on the basis of assessment of the potential risks compared with known benefits [8].PRETRANSPLANTATION SCREENING — All organ donors and potential recipients should be screened for COVID-19 prior to organ procurement. This is necessary to prevent initiation of potent induction immunosuppression in the context of active infection and for the safety of the organ transplant recipients (who are typically potently immunosuppressed in the immediate posttransplant period) and the organ procurement team.Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; primarily used to detect active infection) is the main assay used for screening. The utility of serology (primarily used to detect past infection) for pretransplant screening has not been established. However, once the performance characteristics of serology are more well established among solid organ transplant recipients, serologies may become a helpful adjunct assay. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Donor screening — All donors should be screened for COVID-19 [9]. We generally perform a careful history, obtain chest imaging, and perform microbiologic testing. In all cases the decision to proceed to transplantation should take into account the urgency of the transplant and the risk and benefits in each individual. As general principles:●Donors with known or suspected active COVID-19 based on exposure, symptoms, or chest imaging should generally be declined or deferred.●Donors with known or suspected COVID-19 within the past 28 days should generally be declined or deferred.●Donors who have been exposed to individuals with known or suspected COVID-19 in the recent past (eg, within the past 21 days) should generally be declined or deferred. However, if such a donor tests negative for COVID-19, transplantation can be considered in selected cases (eg, if transplantation is urgently life-saving).●Donors should also be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR performed on respiratory tract samples. The approach to screening varies among institutions and by the organ to be transplanted:•For deceased organ donors (especially lung donors), it is recommended to sample both the upper respiratory tract (eg, nasopharyngeal swab) and the lower respiratory tract (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage) when screening, based upon data suggesting increased sensitivity of lower tract (ie, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) specimens compared with upper tract specimens.•For other donors, screening for COVID-19 should be performed on a single upper respiratory tract sample, at a minimum. The need to obtain serial samples and/or lower respiratory tract samples varies among centers and is often individualized.For living donors who test positive for COVID-19 or for deceased donors who have recovered from COVID-19, the optimal deferral period is not known. Based upon the mean duration of viral shedding (20 days) [10], the American Society of Transplantation (AST) suggests waiting at least 28 days from the time of diagnosis and complete resolution of symptoms (if living donor) before organ donation/procurement be considered [9]. As knowledge of COVID-19 accumulates, screening recommendations are expected to evolve.Candidate screening — All potential organ transplant recipients should be screened for COVID-19 by history, chest imaging, and microbiologic testing prior to transplantation. Although data is lacking, COVID-19 can be asymptomatic, and there is concern that the intense immunosuppression given at the time of transplantation could result in rapidly progressive and potentially fatal COVID-19:●All potential organ recipients should be screened for COVID-19 prior to transplantation. At most transplant centers this includes RT-PCR of an upper respiratory tract specimen (eg, nasopharyngeal swab), a thorough symptom and exposure history, and chest imaging. A chest radiograph is usually sufficient for patients who lack respiratory symptoms, however, for those with respiratory symptoms (even if minor), computed tomography (CT) of the chest is appropriate.●Candidates with active COVID-19 and/or signs or symptoms of other respiratory illnesses should generally be deferred for transplantation.For patients with active COVID-19 and patients who screen positive, the optimal deferral period is not known. The AST suggests waiting until all symptoms have resolved and at least two RT-PCRs for SARS-CoV-2 have been negative [9]. As with any transplantation, the risk of transplantation must be balanced with the risk of not transplanting a patient with acute or recent COVID-19.PREVENTION — Preventive measures for organ transplant recipients are similar to those defined for the general population (eg, social distancing, careful hand and respiratory hygiene). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Prevention'.)One additional consideration is that solid organ transplant recipients who have COVID-19 may shed greater amounts of virus for longer durations than nonimmunosuppressed patients. Thus, a longer duration of isolation and/or testing to document viral clearance to help reduce the likelihood of spreading the infection to others may be needed. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)ACTIVE COVID-19 IN SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTSClinical presentationClinical features — Clinical features of COVID-19 among solid organ transplant recipients are variable and similar to those in nonimmunocompromised patients. However, fever appears to be less common, possibly as a consequence of the effects of immunosuppressive therapy on the systemic inflammatory response [11-13]. As an example, in two case series of solid organ transplant recipients in New York City, fever was a presenting symptom in only 58 to 70 percent [12,13]. Lymphopenia is also common and may be more profound than in nontransplant patients with COVID-19 [13]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Severity of illness — It is unclear if solid organ transplant recipients have a higher risk of severe disease compared with nontransplant patients if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many solid organ transplant recipients have medical comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) that have been associated with more severe COVID-19 disease and mortality, which makes the attributable impact of solid organ transplantation on disease severity difficult to assess.Limited data suggest that solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection may have severe disease, similar to that described in non-solid organ transplant patients with serious underlying comorbidities [12,13]. As an example, in the study of 90 solid organ transplant recipients cited above, 24 percent had mild disease (outpatient care only), 46 percent had moderate disease (admitted to general inpatient floor), and 30 percent had severe disease (mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], or death) [12]. At a median of 20 days, the mortality rate was 18 percent. Compared with patients who had mild to moderate disease, those with severe disease were older and more likely to have hypertension or active cancer, but other comorbidities associated with severe disease in the general population were not significantly different between the groups. In addition, there were no significant differences between the groups in the types of organ transplant or the median time from transplant to COVID-19 diagnosis.Risk factors for severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)Effect of immunosuppression — The impact of immunosuppression in the solid organ transplant population on COVID-19 disease severity remains unclear. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 appears to represent an interplay between direct virally mediated injury and the associated host response, with experimental data suggesting that a dysregulated and hyperintense immune response may mediate more severe disease [14]. Since immunosuppressive agents modulate several aspects of the host immune response, the severity of COVID-19 infection could potentially be affected by the type, combinations, and intensity of immunosuppression. As an example, certain immunosuppressive medications can either directly (eg, lymphocyte-depleting antibodies) or indirectly (eg, antimetabolites) cause lymphopenia, which is a reported risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. Specific agents that have been independently associated with decreased immune responses to vaccines (eg, mammalian [mechanistic] target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors, mycophenolate) could theoretically impair the ability to develop an adequate immune response to natural infection. Conversely, some experimental data suggest that mTOR inhibitors may have some biological activity against SARS-CoV-2 [15]. Additional studies are required to determine the impact of specific immunosuppressive agents on the course of COVID-19 infection.Diagnosis — Criteria for testing for COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients are similar to those for the general population. However, clinicians should have a higher index of suspicion of infection, as is generally recommended for immunosuppressed individuals:●For solid organ transplant recipients with suspected COVID-19 who are hospitalized, testing is recommended.●For solid organ transplant recipients with mild symptoms, optimal practice is not defined. While some favor testing all such patients based upon the potential for rapid disease progression, others favor making a clinical diagnosis and monitoring the patient at home. Thus, the decision is often individualized based upon local COVID-19 prevalence, available resources, and patient-provider preference.●Routine screening of asymptomatic solid organ transplant recipients is not recommended.Specific testing methods are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical suspicion and criteria for testing'.)ManagementGeneral considerations — The approach to the management of acute COVID-19 infection in solid organ transplant recipients is similar to that for nontransplant patients. All specific antiviral agents being used for the treatment of COVID-19 are investigational. Use of these agents is generally limited to hospitalized patients who have or are at risk for severe disease. When possible, treatment should be given as part of a clinical trial.These issues are discussed in more detail separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Adjusting immunosuppression — Adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen are necessarily individualized, based upon disease severity, the specific regimen used, type of organ transplanted, time posttransplant, and the risk of acute allograft rejection [12].Although the optimal approach is not defined, we usually reduce immunosuppression in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection (eg, those requiring hospitalization):●As a first step, we often reduce or hold the antimetabolite (eg, mycophenolate mofetil/sodium), particularly for patients with lymphopenia (eg, absolute lymphocyte count <700 cells/mL).●We generally continue the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) because CNIs inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 pathways, which may contribute to the development of the severe, dysregulated immune response seen in some patients with severe COVID-19.●We typically avoid use of high-dose glucocorticoids as these agents have been associated with prolonged viral shedding and may predispose to poor outcomes, based on experience with other epidemic coronaviruses. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)However, in all cases the decision to reduce immunosuppression must be carefully weighed against the risk for acute rejection, particularly in transplant recipients who generally require high levels of maintenance immunosuppression (eg, lung or heart recipients). The optimal management of immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection is not known, and data are limited to case reports and series [12,13,16,17].There are also concerns that COVID-19 infection itself may increase the risk for acute rejection and that an overly intense inflammatory host immune response might contribute to overall disease severity. Thus, attenuating the immune response by maintaining low-dose immunosuppression could theoretically be beneficial. In addition, experimental data suggest that certain immunosuppressive agents such as mTOR inhibitors may have some biological activity against SARS-CoV-2 [15]. Additional studies are required to confirm these findings.Additional guidance on adjusting immunosuppression in transplant recipients with active infection can be found in the following topic reviews:●(See ""Kidney transplantation in adults: Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy"", section on 'Patients who develop an infection'.)●(See ""Maintenance immunosuppression following lung transplantation"", section on 'Monitoring and adjusting maintenance therapy'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'Issues for ventricular assist devices and cardiac transplantation'.)Recommendations from specific medical societies are listed separately. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Drug-drug interactions — A number of experimental COVID-19 therapies have potential drug-drug interactions with medications that are commonly used among solid organ transplant recipients. In particular, medications that prolong the QT interval (eg, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin) should be used with caution since many solid organ transplant recipients are taking a CNI, which may also prolong the QT interval. In addition, care should be taken with protease inhibitors (such as lopinavir and ritonavir), which can reduce the metabolism and significantly increase blood levels of CNIs (table 1).

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●COVID-19 poses new challenges for individual solid organ transplant candidates and recipients, as well as the process of organ transplantation. (See 'Introduction' above.)●There is a theoretical risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) from an organ donor to a recipient based upon the detection of viral RNA in organs that can be transplanted (eg, lung, heart, kidney, intestine), although donor-derived infections have not been reported to date. (See 'Potential for donor-derived infection' above.)●Because of this risk and the potential for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to health care providers, all solid organ donor and transplant candidates should be screened for COVID-19 by history, chest imaging, and microbiologic testing. (See 'Pretransplantation screening' above.)●Posttransplantation, solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for acquisition of COVID-19 because they are immunocompromised and have frequent contact with the health care system, although this association has not been studied. (See 'Posttransplantation risk' above.)●The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients are variable and similar to those observed in nonimmunocompromised patients. However, fever appears to be less common. Whether the disease course is more severe is not known. (See 'Clinical presentation' above and 'Severity of illness' above.)●The approach to diagnosis is similar to that for the general population. Because signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be subtle in transplant recipients and disease progression can be rapid, some clinicians have a lower threshold for evaluating and testing transplant recipients. (See 'Diagnosis' above.)●The approach to management (eg, use of antivirals, supportive care) is also similar to that for the general population, although careful attention should be paid to potential drug-drug interactions and effects on the immunosuppressive regimen. (See 'General considerations' above and 'Drug-drug interactions' above.)●Adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen are necessarily individualized, based upon disease severity, the specific regimen used, type of organ transplant, time posttransplant, and the risk of acute allograft rejection. Some organ transplant recipients recover without reduction in immunosuppression, which carries the risk of rejection and immune reconstitution. Conversely, continued immunosuppression may enhance the risk of uncontrolled infection. (See 'Adjusting immunosuppression' above.)",2020-05-22 02:00:00,UPTODATE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
ID:127933,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Care of patients with systemic rheumatic disease during the pandemic,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. By 2020, infection with this virus led to a pandemic that has spread throughout most countries of the world. The illness caused by this virus, which has been termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily manifests as a lung infection with symptoms ranging from those of a mild upper respiratory infection to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Severe illness can occur in healthy individuals, but also in patients with underlying medical conditions, including patients with systemic rheumatic diseases. All medical professionals, including rheumatology clinicians, are tasked with rapidly adjusting their practice to curtail the spread of COVID-19, while providing life-sustaining care to their patients.This topic will discuss the care of patients with systemic rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other important aspects of COVID-19 infection are discussed in detail separately:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)RISK OF COVID-19 INFECTIONDisease- and comorbidity-related risks — The presence of a rheumatic disease alone is not known to be associated with an increased risk for developing COVID-19 or with an adverse outcome from the infection. However, patients with various rheumatic diseases have a higher prevalence of several comorbidities such as advanced age, chronic pulmonary and kidney disease, heart disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes [1-7], which in turn are risk factors for severe illness with COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Impact of age'.)There is limited evidence regarding the degree of risk associated with established rheumatic disease. In one series of 86 patients in New York with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases diagnosed with definite or presumed COVID-19, the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization was similar to that for infected patients in the general population in New York City [8]. However, limited observational data have suggested that patients with active rheumatic disease may be at higher risk for developing infections [9-11], although these studies were performed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.Certain laboratory abnormalities seen in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases have been associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19, such as lymphopenia (particularly low CD4+ T cells) and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and creatine kinase (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'); these abnormalities result from the infection and the immune response to the infection. It is unknown whether such abnormalities, if pre-existing due to another disorder (eg, a systemic rheumatic disease), have any impact on disease outcome.Risks associated with rheumatic disease therapies — It is not known whether there is an association of any specific rheumatologic treatment with an increased risk of COVID-19 or its complications, although rheumatic disease therapies have been associated with higher risk of other infections [12,13]. Limited data from observational studies are mixed, with some reports suggesting there may be an increased risk of COVID-19 in patients receiving systemic rheumatic disease therapies, and others suggesting a decreased risk. As examples:●In a series of 86 patients in New York diagnosed with definite or presumed COVID-19, and who also had an immune-mediated inflammatory disease (including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease), those who were receiving biologic agents or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors at baseline were no more likely to require hospitalization for their infection than patients receiving nonbiologic conventional immunosuppressive agents [8].●In a report from the Lombardy region of Italy, where COVID-19 was highly prevalent, of 320 patients with rheumatic disease receiving a biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), only eight were diagnosed with or strongly suspected of COVID-19, and five additional patients had experienced a known exposure to an infected individual but remained asymptomatic [14]. Only one of the rheumatic disease patients required hospital admission and was treated for several days with low-flow oxygen. During this period, over 33,000 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in this region and over 1250 required admission to intensive care.●Another report from the Lombardy region of Italy, involving 1193 patients with psoriasis receiving either biologic agents or conventional small molecule drugs, found that compared with the general population in the region, patients treated with biologics were at higher risk for being symptomatic from COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3.43 [95% CI 2.25-5.73]), to be self-quarantined at home (OR 9.05 [95% CI 5.61-14.61]), and hospitalized (OR 3.59 [95% CI 1.49-8.63]); however, they were not found to be at increased risk of admission to an intensive care unit or of death [15].●Although there has been speculation regarding a potential protective role for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 therapy, substantial numbers of patients among both clinician- and patient self-reported cohorts of rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 were taking HCQ at the time they were diagnosed with the infection (22 and 28 percent of patients, respectively, as of April 27, 2020) [16]. A majority of the patients taking HCQ were also taking other immune-modulating therapies.CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONSClinical presentation of the infection in rheumatic disease patients — The clinical features of COVID-19 among patients with systemic rheumatic diseases are variable and are not known to be different than patients without these underlying diseases. There are insufficient data from reported cases to determine whether the type of rheumatic disease or the intensity of the immunosuppressive agents used influence the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in this population (see 'Disease registries' below). However, it is possible that some rheumatic disease features may be difficult to distinguish from COVID-19. (See 'Rheumatic disease features that can mimic or be mimicked by COVID-19' below.)Rheumatic disease features that can mimic or be mimicked by COVID-19 — A variety of rheumatic diseases may have clinical features that can mimic or be mimicked by COVID-19, such as malaise, myalgias, and fatigue. For patients who carry an existing diagnosis of a rheumatic disease, the clinician may need to distinguish disease flare from possible COVID-19 infection, and a high level of suspicion should be maintained where COVID-19 may be prevalent. The approach to testing for COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Specific examples of such conditions include diseases that can manifest with fever (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), headache (eg, giant cell arteritis [GCA]), gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, spondyloarthritis, systemic sclerosis [SSc], SLE, and Behçet syndrome), dyspnea (eg, interstitial pulmonary disease due to rheumatoid arthritis, SSc, or SLE), stroke (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome [APS]), pernio- or chilblain-like lesions, sometimes called ""COVID toes"" (eg, chilblain lupus erythematosus), and a Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIC-S), sometimes termed pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (eg, Kawasaki disease). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Clinical features'.)In addition, laboratory abnormalities such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels, ferritin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and creatine kinase levels can be seen in both the infection and with various rheumatic diseases.Medications used to treat rheumatic disease may also cause adverse effects that can mimic clinical manifestations of COVID-19 (eg, sulfasalazine [SSZ], which may cause gastrointestinal symptoms, and methotrexate [MTX], which may cause pulmonary abnormalities).Referral for rheumatologic evaluation may be appropriate in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 who do not have an established rheumatic disease diagnosis yet have any additional clinical feature concerning for rheumatic disease (eg, findings suggestive of synovitis or serologies characteristic of autoimmune rheumatic disease).MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH KNOWN OR SUSPECTED SARS-CoV-2 EXPOSURE OR INFECTIONMedication management in stable asymptomatic patients following exposure — Adjustments to medication regimens in patients with stable rheumatic disease who are asymptomatic but thought to be recently exposed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus should be individualized. Our general approach is as follows [17]:●Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)/chloroquine (CQ), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be continued.●Whether methotrexate (MTX) or leflunomide (LEF) should be discontinued must be assessed on a case-by-case basis weighing the potential risks of infection and its sequelae against the possible risk of rheumatic disease flare during the period the drug is held. If the medications have been temporarily held, they can generally be resumed pending a negative test result for COVID-19 or after two weeks of symptom-free observation.●Cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA), tacrolimus, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, abatacept, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (eg, tofacitinib) should be stopped temporarily, pending a negative test result for COVID-19 or after two weeks of symptom-free observation.●Interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitors may be continued in selected patients, particularly those at high risk for developing a cytokine release-like syndrome, preferably in a study protocol. The decision to use these agents should be made in close consultation with the experts in infectious disease and critical care involved in the management of the patient's acute illness. The role of IL-6 blockade in the management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)The approach described above is largely based upon expert opinion and extrapolation from the management of patients on these medications who have developed other infections and is consistent with the management practices recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [17], as well as being generally similar to other guidelines [18,19]. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Use of NSAIDs, including both indications and contraindications for their use, would not differ from patients without exposure to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with most international and specialty guidelines, given the lack of scientific evidence for any novel increased risk associated with NSAID use in patients with COVID-19 [17,20-22]. HCQ and SSZ can be continued given the relatively low risk of serious infection associated with either of them [23,24]. In addition, for diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), discontinuation of HCQ is associated with a disease flare. The limited evidence and role of HCQ/CQ in the management of COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine'.)While treatment with MTX and LEF are also associated with a relatively low risk of serious infection [25,26], particularly when given as monotherapy, we decide whether or not to continue these medications on a case-by-case basis.The rationale for temporarily discontinuing the other immunosuppressive drugs, biologic agents, and JAK inhibitors are based upon their associated increased risk of serious infection compared with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) [12,13], and the theoretically low likelihood of a disease flare for withholding these medications over such a limited time period. One exception to discontinuation of biologic agents may be the use of IL-6 inhibitors, given some reports of potential benefit for patients who develop an intense inflammatory state similar to cytokine release syndrome due to severe COVID-19; however, randomized trials to examine their efficacy during infection are ongoing. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)Medication management with documented or presumptive COVID-19 — Adjustments to medication regimens in patients with documented or presumptive COVID-19 should be individualized with specific attention to the severity of the infection. Our overall approach is as follows:●Antimalarial therapies (ie, HCQ/CQ) may be continued, with the caveat that hospitalized patients may require additional surveillance given that cardiotoxicity may be heightened in patients with COVID-19. Concomitant use of medications that can prolong the QT interval should be avoided. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)'.)●SSZ, MTX, LEF, immunosuppressants (eg, MMF, AZA), biologic agents other than IL-6 receptor inhibitors, and JAK inhibitors should be stopped or held.●For patients with severe respiratory, cardiac, or kidney involvement, NSAIDs should be discontinued as they would be in patients without COVID-19.●IL-6 receptor inhibitors may be continued in selected patients, particularly those at high risk for developing a cytokine release-like syndrome, preferably in a study protocol. The decision to use these agents should be made in close consultation with the experts in infectious disease and critical care involved in the management of the patient's acute illness. The role of IL-6 blockade in the management of COVID-19 is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)●Glucocorticoids should not be abruptly discontinued.The approach described above is largely based upon expert opinion and extrapolation from the management of patients taking these medications who have developed other serious infections and is consistent with the management practices recommended by the ACR [17], as well as being generally similar to other guidelines [18,19]. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Rheumatology'.)Given the low risk of serious infection associated with HCQ or CQ as well as the potential benefit of preventing a rheumatic disease flare, we generally continue these therapies in patients who are already taking them (see 'Medication management in stable asymptomatic patients following exposure' above). The rationale for holding SSZ is mainly related to concerns about potential adverse effects from this agent (eg, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, hepatitis, cytopenias, and, rarely, pneumonitis) that could be confused with clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19. Additionally, temporarily holding SSZ for up to two to three weeks would be unlikely to result in significant rheumatic disease flares.We discontinue MTX, LEF, immunosuppressants, biologic agents other than IL-6 blockers, and JAK inhibitors given our concern for impairing the host defense against COVID-19 and the risk of causing additional infections, although there are no data to confirm or convincingly refute such risk. In addition, the risk of rheumatic disease flare is likely to be relatively low in the limited period during which the antirheumatic drugs are likely to be held. Most infections associated with these medications are bacterial and opportunistic in origin; these risks remain relevant, as a substantial proportion of patients with COVID-19 develop the complication of bacterial pneumonia [27]. Additional risks of treatment with certain biologics and JAK inhibitors include reactivation of viral infections, including herpes zoster [28].Although glucocorticoids convey increased risk of infections, abrupt discontinuation is not feasible or safe in seriously ill patients. To minimize adverse reactions, we treat patients who require glucocorticoids for systemic rheumatic disease with the lowest necessary dose for the shortest period of time. (See ""Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids"".)Postinfection management — The optimal time to resume immunosuppressive medications after infection with COVID-19 is unknown; we generally do not restart immunosuppressive medications until patients are no longer symptomatic and at least two weeks have passed since documented infection. There are limited data to address this issue. In a small observational study of nine patients, seroconversion was detected in all patients after two weeks, viral loads progressively decreased, but despite their detection, live virus was unable to be isolated after eight days [29]. Further information regarding how long patients may remain infectious is needed.MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF INFECTION OR KNOWN EXPOSUREGeneral principles●Patients with rheumatic diseases should be practicing the widely recommended prevention strategies that are focused on mitigating infection risk. This includes adopting practices such as optimal hand hygiene, physical distancing, and wearing a mask in public when adequate physical distancing is not possible. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Prevention'.)●For patients with newly diagnosed, stable, or active disease, management generally does not differ from usual treatment approaches in the absence of COVID-19. We initiate or continue all medications indicated for the management of the patient's systemic rheumatic disease. These may include conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and other immunosuppressive agents, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)/chloroquine (CQ), sulfasalazine (SSZ), methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide (LEF), tacrolimus, cyclosporine (CSA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and azathioprine (AZA); biologic agents (eg, abatacept, tocilizumab); Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors; and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Continuation of HCQ/CQ is particularly important in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), if available, especially those with active or severe disease and those who are pregnant.●Glucocorticoids should not be abruptly discontinued, but should be used at the lowest dose possible to control the underlying rheumatic disease, regardless of exposure or infection status.Modifications to routine rheumatologic care — Modifications to routine rheumatologic care that minimize risk of exposure to COVID-19 when possible include:●Optimal use of telehealth visits.●Decreased frequency of routine laboratory surveillance when associated risk is deemed to be low. Decisions regarding the safest intervals for testing need to be individualized, based, for example, upon the patient's overall clinical status, comorbidities, prior stability of testing, and medication use.●Use of lower-volume laboratories offsite from larger health care facilities.●For patients in areas affected by the epidemic who receive treatment at infusion centers, an additional treatment option that may be appropriate is switching to forms of the same medications or medications of the same class that can be self-administered by subcutaneous injection. However, neither the theoretical added safety benefits nor risk of disease flare with this approach have been formally evaluated in this setting, and the decision should be individualized.Prognosis — There is no available evidence identifying risk factors of poor outcomes with COVID-19 infection specific to patients with rheumatic disease, nor evidence of adverse rheumatic disease outcomes following infection other than the short-term risk of increased disease activity due to temporary drug discontinuation.DISEASE REGISTRIES — To improve the understanding of the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection on patients with systemic rheumatic diseases, we strongly urge that all such patients be enrolled in patient registries whenever possible, including the following and other national and regional registries:●COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry●The EULAR – COVID-19 Reporting registry for rheumatologists and other cliniciansLINKS FOR PATIENT EDUCATION — Links to resources with information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for patients with rheumatic diseases from select rheumatology society and government-sponsored guidelines are presented separately.

ID:127762,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines,"INTRODUCTION — The pneumonia associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or nCoV) may lead to respiratory failure with profound hypoxemia requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The rapidly spreading pandemic may result in utilization of all available intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators in individual institutions and regions. Repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term use for days or weeks to ventilate COVID-19 patients or other patients requiring mechanical ventilation has been proposed, but is somewhat unprecedented. Furthermore, anesthesia machines have only been rarely used to administer inhalation anesthetics during prolonged ventilation. This topic will address management of short-term or long-term intensive care ventilation with an anesthesia machine, emphasizing this use for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [1]. Airway management and anesthetic care of patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection for surgical procedures, including preventing infection of anesthesia personnel or contamination of anesthesia machines and equipment are addressed in a separate topic. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)Use of standard ICU ventilators and ventilation of critically ill patients COVID-19 patients are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.)Other details regarding obstetric and critical care of patients with COVID-19 infection, and general medical management are available in additional topics:●(See ""Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumented delivery)"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)PREVENTION OF ANESTHESIA MACHINE CONTAMINATION — Preventing contamination of the external parts of the anesthesia machine, its breathing system and ventilator, and its connection to the gas analyzer and attached monitoring equipment while in use for patients with COVID-19 is described in another topic. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Protection of anesthesia equipment'.)Contamination of an anesthesia machine during use as an intensive care ventilator for patients with known COVID-19 infection is more likely than use during a surgical procedure because of the duration and extent of machine exposure. Based on studies of other coronaviruses, it is estimated that infected patients exhale 0 to 100,000 virus particles per 30 minutes, or as many as 4,800,000 particles per day [2]. However, a single filter with a viral filtration efficiency (VFE) of 99.9999 percent (ie, a good mechanical pleated filter at the expiratory limb) would allow 4.8 of these particles, on average, to pass. If two filters are used such as a heat and moisture exchange filter (HMEF) containing an electrostatic filter placed at the airway plus a mechanical pleated filter placed at the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit (figure 1), the combined VFE is very high (perhaps as high as 99.99999999 percent), rendering contamination of the anesthesia machine unlikely, even when used for multiple days (with fresh filters each day). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Contamination of the internal components of the anesthesia machine'.)LOCATIONS FOR ANESTHESIA MACHINES — Location(s) selected for use of anesthesia machines to ventilate COVID-19-positive patients will be institution-dependent due to considerations such as layout of selected hospital area(s), location of rooms with negative pressure capabilities, and availability of sources of electrical power, high-pressure oxygen, and medical air [1,3]. Personnel considerations include availability of anesthesia personnel to manage ventilation with anesthesia machines, and convenience for critical care consultants. When multiple anesthesia machines are used in a single location, the compressed gas pipelines should be assessed to ensure that supply is adequate to meet consumption if supplying an area where multiple anesthesia ventilators are using high fresh gas flows (FGFs). The electrical supply should also be assessed to ensure that circuits will not be overloaded, particularly in areas outside the operating room (OR).Availability of compatible connections from the scavenger system to waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets or medical vacuum outlets is another necessary consideration if inhalation anesthetic agents are to be administered using the anesthesia machine. However, gas scavenging is not necessary if inhalation agents are avoided. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' below and 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below.)Institutional options for location of anesthesia machine ventilators may include intensive care unit (ICU) rooms, the presurgical holding area, post-anesthesia care units (PACUs), or individual ORs [1]. In some institutions, it may be possible to treat two or more COVID-19 patients in the same OR if there are multiple sources of oxygen and medical air, and if anesthesia personnel (ie, anesthesiologists, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists [CRNAs], Certified Anesthesiologist Assistants [CAAs]) are deployed most easily in an OR setting. Notably, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) guidelines for repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation recommend that anesthesia professionals be immediately available at all times to manage and monitor the anesthesia ventilator (and administration of inhalation anesthetic agents, if used), as well as to assist with respiratory care (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator), regardless of the locations(s) for the anesthesia machines [4,5]. (See 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' below and 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' below.) LONG-TERM VENTILATION WITH ANESTHESIA MACHINES — The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidance for anesthesia care team members regarding repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator) [4,5]. These professional societies recommend that anesthesia professionals be immediately available at all times to manage and monitor the anesthesia ventilator. Professional staff who are not anesthesiologists (eg, some intensivists, as well as respiratory therapists, and intensive care unit [ICU] nurses) are experts in respiratory care, but are not familiar with anesthesia machines. Because of the increased amount of interaction required, using anesthesia machine ventilators for patients who require mechanical ventilation for a period of time, but who are not COVID-19-positive, may be a good option for optimal use of institutional resources.Limited data regarding duration of mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 patients suggest that two or more weeks are often necessary. Collaboration with critical care teams throughout this period is clearly essential to achieve optimal respiratory care, and to manage other systemic problems in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.)Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators — Data are limited regarding the capabilities of anesthesia machine ventilators developed by various manufacturers to mimic ICU ventilator parameters or reliably provide continuous mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods of time. Although newer anesthesia ventilators incorporate multiple controlled and assisted modes of ventilation that are nearly identical to intensive care ventilators, there are several important technical issues that are unique to anesthesia machines, which must be considered during use for long-term ventilation.Adjusting humidification of inspired gases●The need to adjust fresh gas flow (FGF) to prevent condensed water accumulation in the breathing circuit [3]. Intensive care ventilators deliver fresh gas during each inspiration, and discharge all exhaled gas into the room. Because compressed gases have zero humidity, active humidification is necessary. The ability to alter FGF and the fraction of exhaled gas rebreathed is a key feature distinguishing an anesthesia ventilator from an ICU ventilator. FGF is typically reduced during general anesthesia to conserve inhalation anesthetic agent. A FGF that is lower than minute ventilation increases rebreathing of exhaled gas, which has been humidified by the body. The reaction of rebreathed carbon dioxide (CO2) with the CO2 absorbent produces additional humidity within the circuit. Experience to date indicates that when an anesthesia machine is in long-term use as an ICU ventilator, reducing FGF leads to excessive humidity in the breathing circuit, and the need to change CO2 absorbent frequently (see ""Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions"", section on 'Carbon dioxide absorbent exhaustion or toxicity'). This additional humidity can be clinically significant leading to water condensation within the breathing circuit that can increase resistance to gas flow through the system, interfere with sensors such as respiratory gas analyzers and flow sensors, and increase risk for coinfections [3]. For these reasons, significant accumulations of water in the breathing circuit (typically expiratory limb) must be emptied. Accumulated water should be emptied carefully and while wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE), because it may be contaminated with virus. Condensers and water traps may be added to some breathing systems to aid in managing excessive humidity [2]. Issues with supply chains have limited purchase of such water traps during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, new options have been designed and tested in some institutions [3].To prevent buildup of humidity and decrease the use of CO2 absorbent, it is recommended that FGF be set to equal minute ventilation initially (approximately 6 to 8 L/minute in adult patients). Generally, it should be apparent in one to two hours if excess moisture is accumulating in the breathing circuit. If it is, FGF can be increased incrementally (eg, by 0.5 to 1 L/min) until humidity is controlled. Alternately, FGF can be set higher (eg, 1.5 times minute ventilation) initially, and can then be reduced in increments of 500 mL/minute with vigilant monitoring for the appearance of humidity in the inspiratory limb. Once FGF exceeds 1.5 times minute ventilation, there is little rebreathing, and increasing FGF further does not provide any advantage and wastes compressed gas (oxygen and medical air).●The need for long-term humidification and warming of inspired gases. Critical care patients should inspire warm humidified gases to prevent drying of secretions and respiratory epithelium. At the low FGFs typically used in the operating room (OR), inspired gas is humidified due to rebreathing [6,7], and also by the release of heat and humidity by the reaction of CO2 with the absorbent [8]. The presence of condensate in the inspiratory hose indicates that the inspired gas relative humidity is >100 percent at room temperature.However, a heat and moisture exchange filter (HMEF) may be necessary when high FGFs are used to prevent condensed water accumulation during prolonged ventilation with an anesthesia machine. The HMEF should be placed at the endotracheal tube connection to the breathing circuit (after the Y-piece and the gas sampling port (figure 1)). This HMEF will ensure that adequate humidity is maintained in the lungs and will also filter viral particles. Filters and HMEFs at the airway are prone to obstruction from moisture or secretions. Compared with the OR setting, obstruction of an airway filter or HMEF placed on an anesthesia machine breathing circuit in the ICU may be less likely to be detected early since there may not be constant attendance by an anesthesia professional. Airway filters and HMEFs should be inspected no less frequently than every hour, and changed when obstruction is a concern, or once every 24 hours. Devices that actively humidify inspired gas are not recommended. They cause problems with ventilation and monitoring since anesthesia machines are not designed to handle large amounts of condensed water within their breathing circuit. Unique safety issues●The need to place a second high-quality viral filter (typically a pleated mechanical filter that does not need heat and humidity exchange properties) on the expiratory limb of an anesthesia machine breathing circuit used for ventilation of a COVID-19 patient, even if a filter or HMEF is placed at the airway (figure 1) (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"", section on 'Contamination of the internal components of the anesthesia machine'). The filter at the expiratory limb can likely be left in place for a longer period of time than the filter placed at the airway; however, there are no data predicting filter performance over time. Since many institutions have filter shortages, these expiratory limb filters should only be changed as necessary.●Potential need to prevent accidental administration of inhalation anesthetic agents. If there are no plans to administer inhalation anesthetics to achieve patient sedation, then the vaporizers for the volatile agents should be removed or drained. Also, the nitrous oxide (N2O) cylinder and pipeline hoses should be removed. These measures ensure that inhalation anesthetic agents are not accidentally administered. However, some institutions with inadequate supplies of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are commonly used in the ICU may consider emergency use of low doses of a volatile inhalation anesthetic agent (isoflurane or sevoflurane), as explained below. (See 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below.)●The potential for the CO2 absorbent to expire. The inspired CO2 and the color indicator of the CO2 absorbent should be monitored frequently. The absorbent should be replaced if inspired CO2 increases (eg, above 5 mmHg) or if the CO2 absorbent color indicates that it has become exhausted. If ventilation must be interrupted to change the absorbent, the patient should be temporarily ventilated by an alternative means. Furthermore, potential reactions with the CO2 absorbent may occur if a volatile anesthetic agent is employed and the absorbent becomes dried by the FGF. (See ""Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions"", section on 'Carbon dioxide absorbent exhaustion or toxicity'.)There are three reasons not to simply remove the CO2 absorber canister, or use an empty absorber canister:•CO2 absorption is important to prevent hypercarbia if FGF decreases below 1 to 1.5 times minute ventilation (purposely or inadvertently).•The breathing system may leak if the canister is removed. The valve installed on some machines to prevent a leak is intended for use for short periods while the canister is being changed, and is not dependable for longer-term use•The canister should not be left empty because that would significantly increase the compliance of the breathing system.●Potential need to adjust the scavenger system of the anesthesia machine. If an anesthesia machine is used outside of an OR, it may not be possible to connect its scavenger system to a compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal or vacuum outlet. Waste anesthetic gas disposal outlets are typically only found in operating or procedure rooms, and waste gas hoses from the anesthesia machine may not be compatible with medical vacuum outlets found elsewhere. Waste anesthetic gas scavenging is only necessary when use of inhalation anesthetic agents is planned (see 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' below). Importantly, if a scavenger system with a reservoir bag (closed scavenger system) is not connected to vacuum, it can cause high PEEP and peak pressures due to backup of waste gas into the breathing system. Options include:•If no inhalation anesthetic agents are to be used (picture 1):-Disconnection of the scavenger system from the hoses coming from the breathing system and ventilator -Removal of the scavenger reservoir bag (if it is a closed scavenger system) •If inhalation anesthetic agent will be used, scavenging is required. Connection of the scavenger system to suction in locations outside the OR (eg, the ICU) may be difficult if the connections are incompatible. In such cases, alternate tubing or connectors, or connection adapters may be used. When higher than usual FGFs are used, scavenger suction must be adjusted upward to ensure proper function. ●Potential need to modify oxygen utilization by the anesthesia machine ventilator if institutional oxygen supply is limited by factors such as [3,9]:•Delay in delivery of liquid oxygen to the hospital•Excessive use of oxygen by the hospital, such that the oxygen vaporizers (where liquid oxygen is converted to gas oxygen) become covered in ice, resulting in inefficiency •Inability of the flow in an oxygen pipeline branch to keep up with demand due to caliber of the pipeline, and the number of ventilators, anesthesia machines, and oxygen flowmeters on that branch. This is more typically a problem in some older hospitals.When the oxygen consumption outstrips the maximum oxygen supply, all the ventilators, anesthesia machines, and oxygen flowmeters on that pipeline branch will be affected. Thus, the inspired oxygen concentration delivered by an individual anesthesia machine will decrease if air is being used, and the machine alarm may activate during each inspiratory cycle. Anesthesia machines with bellows ventilators typically use oxygen as the drive gas that compresses the bellows; these ventilators consume oxygen at a rate approximating minute ventilation plus additional oxygen used in the FGF at the rate of FGF times percent oxygen, with sporadic consumption that increases dramatically during inspiration. However, machines with bellows ventilators may be modified by a qualified clinical engineer to be powered by compressed air instead of oxygen [3,9], a modification made that must be made when the machine is not in use (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators).Conversely, anesthesia machines with electrically powered (ie, piston or turbine) ventilators are similar to ICU ventilators, in that they typically consume oxygen at the rate of minute ventilation times percent oxygen, and do not consume oxygen above what is delivered in the fresh gas. ●The need for periodic performance of an anesthesia machine self-test (ie, power-up test) approximately every 24 to 72 hours. The ASA and anesthesia machine manufacturers recommend a pre-use check every day prior to using the machine in the OR setting. For prolonged use, most manufactures have stated that this can be done approximately every three days. Experience has shown that problems such as inaccurate ventilation delivery and monitoring may occur when anesthesia machines are not restarted and checked at three-day intervals.Notably, an alternative means of ventilation is necessary (eg, with a manual resuscitator or a second ventilator) while the machine is powered down, restarted, and checked. A step-by-step procedure should be followed to ensure that all equipment is available to prevent patient lung de-recruitment, as well as to limit spillage of breathing circuit gas and other contaminants and protect anesthesia personnel during this process (refer to APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and the ASA's Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machines as an ICU Ventilator) [4,5]. A suggested procedure has been developed by the APSF and ASA (refer to the APSF/ASA Procedure for Supporting Patients during the Anesthesia Machine Self-Test) [10].●The need to periodically check the breathing circuit for possible kinking or compression since, unlike ICU ventilators, there is no articulating arm on the anesthesia machine that can hold the breathing circuit up off the bed.●The need to minimize potential for errors in setup of anesthesia machines, initiation of controlled ventilation, and respiratory monitoring in locations outside of the OR suite, ideally by deploying multiple machines of the same model within any one hospital unit (eg, ICU, post-anesthesia care unit [PACU]). Adjusting ventilatory settings●The need to understand how specific capabilities differ among individual anesthesia machines:•Newer anesthesia machines have ventilator capabilities similar to modern ICU ventilators, with more flexible settings that can deliver more modes of ventilation (including assist modes) compared with older models. Newer models with compliance compensation and tidal volume delivery unaffected by changes in FGF are generally preferred (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators). •Newer machines are also equipped with breathing systems and ventilators that can be sterilized between patients, and are better choices for those with COVID-19 infection.•Older models can be reserved for surgical patients and for ventilation of patients without COVID-19 respiratory disease, if feasible.●The need to understand how settings and performance of anesthesia machine ventilators differ from those of ICU ventilators when making adjustments in ventilator settings:•Anesthesia machines do not default to pressure support of extra breaths in control modes. Care must be taken to add this when changing ventilator modes.•Anesthesia machines may have a lower peak inspiratory flow rate. Negative airway pressure occurs if the patient inhales faster than the maximum inspiratory flow rate provided by the ventilator.•Anesthesia machines are milliseconds slower to respond to patient effort because of the circle breathing system interposed between the patient and anesthesia ventilator [11], which can cause more hyperventilation in an air-hungry patient.•Inspiratory time is not directly set on an anesthesia machine. Most anesthesia machines do not provide direct control of inspiratory time; instead this is controlled indirectly by setting the I:E ratio and the respiratory rate.Options for setting the anesthesia machine ventilator include:-In volume control modes (including synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation [SIMV]), the inspiratory flow rate can be increased by increasing tidal volume or by decreasing inspiratory time (accomplished by reducing the I:E ratio or by increasing the respiratory rate). Introducing an inspiratory pause (Tpause or TIP) will also increase the inspiratory flow rate during the active portion of inspiration, before the pause.-In pressure control or support modes, the inspiratory flow rate can be increased by lowering the flow trigger level for ventilation (which also increases the speed at which pressure-support is provided), or by decreasing the rise time of pressure support (which increases the inspiratory flow rate). On Draeger anesthesia machine ventilators, the flow trigger level is called ""Trigger L/min"" and the rise time is called ""Tslope."" On GE Healthcare Systems anesthesia machine ventilators, the flow trigger level is called ""Flow Trigger"" and the rise time is called ""Rise Rate."" However, lowering the flow trigger level may cause extra mis-triggered breaths in some patients; if these occur, the flow trigger level must be increased. On some Draeger machine ventilators, the maximum inspiratory flow is governed by a facility-level setting, although on-site clinical engineers can adjust this parameter to allow a maximum inspiratory flow of 75 L/min.●Potential need to modify default ventilator parameters and alarm settings. Default settings on the anesthesia machine, such as minute ventilation, airway pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels, and alarms, may be modified to better match those of an ICU ventilator. The default alarm volumes should be set to maximum.●The potential for the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration in the breathing circuit to be lower than the set oxygen gas concentration on the anesthesia machine (FgO2), especially at lower FGFs. Because of the rebreathing that occurs in an anesthesia machine circle breathing circuit, inspired oxygen concentration depends on both the ratio of oxygen to air in the delivered fresh gas (determined by the FGF setting) and the total FGF (which influences the amount of rebreathing). Thus, inspired oxygen concentration must be continuously monitored (see 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' below). ●Notably, when total FGF is very high (eg, >12 L/minute), a FiO2 of 100 percent cannot be delivered if the total FGF is higher than the maximum possible flow of oxygen. For instance, if a total FGF of 15 L/minute is necessary, and the maximum oxygen flow is only 12 L/min, then 3 L/min of air must be added. This may be confusing on anesthesia machines that have controls for total FGF and for oxygen percent.Monitoring long-term ventilation — An anesthesia professional should be available to start ventilation and subsequently monitor degree of moisture accumulation, inspired and expired CO2, filter integrity, overall anesthesia machine function, and effectiveness of ventilation [1]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome'.) The APSF/ASA guidelines address additional maintenance and monitoring requirements during use of anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation of COVID-19 patients (refer to APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions - Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator) [4,5]. These additional considerations are necessary due to use of extra filters which may become clogged, the tendency to accumulate condensed water in the breathing circuit, and risks for aerosolizing droplets containing COVID-19 virus.Documentation of this enhanced monitoring of continuous and intermittent parameters is necessary. This may be achieved automatically if the anesthesia machine connected to the hospital network for recording to the electronic medical record [1], or manually using a template developed for this purpose by the anesthesia team.Patient monitoring — Baseline monitored parameters (eg, tidal volume, plateau pressure [Pplat], minute ventilation) should be recorded when ventilation is initiated. If spirometry is available, saving or photographing the baseline tracings and reference loops may aid in later diagnosis of filter obstructions.Continuously monitored parameters (with preset alarms) that are checked and recorded each hour include:●Inspired oxygen concentration. ●Inspired and expired CO2.●Inspiratory pressure.●Tidal volume and respiratory rate. ●Low oxygen pressure alarm. If an anesthesia machines with an oxygen-driven bellows is being used, a low oxygen pressure alarm triggered by each inspiration may indicate a high demand on the institutional central oxygen pipeline system, particularly when multiple ventilators are simultaneously in use. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)Intermittently monitored ventilatory and physiologic parameters include:●Check Pplat at least once every four hours, and after each change in PEEP or tidal volume, to ensure that it is ≤30 cm H2O. Measurement of Pplat is accomplished during a 0.5 second inspiratory pause. Unlike many ICU ventilators, anesthesia machines do not have a control to manually initiate an inspiratory pause. On an anesthesia machine ventilator, a 0.5 second inspiratory pause can be generated by temporarily setting the mode to volume ventilation with the tidal volume that the patient has been receiving, at 10 breaths per minute, with an I:E ratio of 1:2 and a 50 percent inspiratory pause (Tpause or TIP). (See 'Adjusting ventilatory settings' above.)●Check the flow readings approximately every four hours, since these may become less accurate over time. If the machine is equipped with both inspiratory and expiratory flow sensors, a gradual increase in the difference between inspired and exhaled tidal volume measurements usually indicates that a startup test is needed to recalibrate the breathing system flow sensors.●Confirm there is no leak around the endotracheal tube cuff every hour because such a leak produces respiratory droplets and aerosolized viral particles. A leak around the endotracheal tube cuff typically manifests as measured exhaled tidal volume that is lower than measured inhaled tidal volume, and a flow-volume loop that does not close [12]. At low FGFs a bellows ventilator may progressively empty, while the reservoir bag will progressively deflate in machines with a piston or turbine ventilator. High FGF compensates for small leaks, obscuring these indicators of breathing circuit volume.Machine maintenance and monitoring — Intermittent inspection and maintenance of proper anesthesia machine and breathing circuit function including:●Inspect the breathing circuit hoses and water trap for excessive condensed water every hour. An oscillating obstructive gas flow tracing during exhalation indicates condensed water accumulation in the expiratory, scavenger, or ventilator hose. An oscillating obstructive gas flow tracing during inhalation indicates condensed water accumulation in the inspiratory or ventilator hose.If fluid has accumulated in the breathing circuit and is threatening to impede ventilation, it must be removed [3]. Plans should be in place to ventilate the patient while the circuit is emptied. One novel method that has been described is placement of an airway filter casing with a Luer connector in the expiratory limb to serve as a water trap, enabling aspiration of condensed water by syringe without interrupting ventilation [3]. Further, proper collection and disposal procedures for contaminated water and PPE for personnel performing this procedure are necessary since the fluid being removed may be contaminated with virus.●Inspect the breathing circuit hoses for possible kinking or compression every hour as well.●Inspect the airway and expiratory limb breathing circuit filters every hour to check for excessive humidity or secretions that may cause obstruction of gas flow. The airway filter is at highest risk (figure 1). Obstructed filters must be changed. Otherwise, filters are typically replaced every 24 hours. High peak airway pressure during volume ventilation or low tidal volume during pressure ventilation are signs of profound obstruction of the filters placed at the airway or in the expiratory limb (figure 1) [3]. Decreased peak expiratory flow and prolongation of expiratory flow are earlier indications of partial obstruction of one of these filters [12]. Significant obstruction of either filter also creates additional PEEP, with a difference between the set and actual PEEP that can be seen in the airway pressure when the expiratory limb filter is obstructed. Notably, this additional PEEP is invisible when the airway filter is obstructed since airway pressure is measured downstream of that filter. ●Check the CO2 absorbent color and inspired CO2 values every hour to ensure that the absorbent is still functioning properly and does not need to be exchanged. This is especially important if lower FGFs are being used.●Confirm that an anesthesia machine startup test was performed once every 24 to 72 hours (refer to the APSF/ASA Procedure for Supporting Patients during the Anesthesia Machine Self-Test) [10]. (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)USE OF INHALATION ANESTHETICS FOR SEDATION — During the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation may lead some institutions to consider using low doses of a potent volatile inhalation anesthetic agent (isoflurane or sevoflurane) [13]. Compared with other critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 have higher sedation requirements that may be due to their younger age, higher respiratory drive, and a particularly intense inflammatory response [14,15]. Although we are not recommending routine administration of inhalation anesthetic agents to critically ill patients for prolonged periods due to scant safety data in this setting, as well as some disadvantages (see 'Advantages and disadvantages' below), the ready availability of these agents is an advantage when anesthesia machines are used to provide mechanical ventilation. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Sedation and analgesia'.)The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidelines for such emergency use (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [16].Intravenous sedative-analgesic regimens that are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation are discussed in separate topics:●(See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal"".)●(See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects"".)●(See ""Pain control in the critically ill adult patient"".)Dosing to achieve sedation — Administration of low doses of either sevoflurane (eg, 0.5 to 1.4 percent) or isoflurane (eg, 0.2 to 0.7 percent) for long-term sedation is reasonable if use of a volatile inhalation anesthetic agent becomes necessary.Factors influencing dosing include whether the targeted level of sedation is achieved with satisfactory patient comfort. The presence of ventilator dyssynchrony may necessitate deepening the anesthetic/sedation level. Conversely, if hypotension is present, lightening of the anesthetic/sedation level is necessary. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Clinical effects'.)When the decision is made to allow the patient to awaken, the anesthetic vaporizer is turned off, and fresh gas flow (FGF) is increased. Washout of anesthetic agent is rapid and predictable, with patients typically able to respond to commands and be assessed for extubation within 10 to 15 minutes. (See ""Emergence from general anesthesia"", section on 'Inhalation agents'.)Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics — In addition to the suggested monitoring noted above for use of anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation (see 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above), specialized monitoring requiring the constant presence of an anesthesia provider is necessary during administration of inhalation anesthetic agents.Patient monitoring during sedation●Continuously monitored parameters include:•End-tidal anesthetic concentration, with titration of anesthetic dosing to the minimal effective end-tidal concentration. The low-level and high-level alarms on the anesthetic gas monitor should be enabled.•Exhaled end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) to monitor for the possibility of malignant hyperthermia (which severely and acutely increases ETCO2), and to help manage ventilation. (See 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above.)•Temperature, since potent inhalation anesthetics lower core temperatures (see ""Perioperative temperature management"", section on 'Anesthetic effects on thermoregulation'), and to monitor for the possibility of malignant hyperthermia (which acutely increases temperature to >102°F [38.9°C).●Other monitored parameters include:•Hemodynamic monitoring per usual standards for care of individual critically ill patients, and may be useful to evaluate cardiovascular responses to an inhalation anesthetic agent. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Hemodynamic monitoring' and ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Cardiovascular effects'.)•Serum creatinine and liver function tests are obtained at intervals that may be daily (in consultation with the critical care team), as a check for renal or hepatic dysfunction during long-term administration of a volatile anesthetic agent.Equipment monitoring during sedation — Intermittent inspection and maintenance of anesthetic administration includes:●The fill level of anesthetic vaporizers is checked every hour since rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents occurs due to high FGF; refill when anesthetic level <20 percent full.Liquid anesthetic use can be estimated. One mL of a liquid volatile anesthetic agent yields approximately 200 mL of gas anesthetic (specific values are 195 mL for isoflurane or 184 mL for sevoflurane). Thus, at 10 L/min of FGF, the liquid volatile anesthetic consumption is approximately 30 mL/hour if a 1 percent inhaled concentration is delivered. Most vaporizers hold approximately 200 ml of liquid, so refills would be needed multiple times each day even at the lower doses noted above for use of isoflurane or sevoflurane for patient sedation during mechanical ventilation. (See 'Dosing to achieve sedation' above.)One way to reduce consumption of volatile anesthetic agent is to reduce FGF. Another way to agent consumption is to use an anesthetic reflector device such as the AnaConDa or Mirus [17-22]. These devices are designed for administration of inhalation anesthetic agents using a traditional intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator, but are not approved for use in the United States. The device is placed between the Y-piece and patient, where it vaporizes small amounts of anesthetic liquid, and absorbs most of the exhaled anesthetic, which is then re-inhaled on the next breath (much like a heat and moisture exchanger [HME] absorbs and conserves humidity). Notably, room contamination still occurs with use of these devices unless a scavenging system is employed [20-22]. ●Proper functioning of the scavenging system is confirmed when administration of inhalation anesthetics is initiated, then every 24 hours or after major changes in the rate of FGF. Anesthetic vapor is consumed rapidly and the scavenger system requires high vacuum flow when high FGF is used. Advantages and disadvantages — Advantages and disadvantages of specific agents (sevoflurane versus isoflurane) are discussed separately. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Sevoflurane' and ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Isoflurane'.)Potential advantages and disadvantages for long-term use of sevoflurane or isoflurane for sedation of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 induced respiratory failure include:●Advantages•Effective sedative effects, with rapid onset and offset allowing easy titratability. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Sedation and anesthesia'.)•Minimal metabolism and likely minimal organ toxicity. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Properties and delivery"", section on 'Metabolism'.)•Ready availability during shortages of the intravenous sedatives and analgesic agents that are usually employed for sedation during mechanical ventilation [13]. Reports of unusually high sedation requirements in many COVID-19 patients may contribute to shortages of multiple commonly used intravenous agents [13,14]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Sedation and analgesia'.).•Potentially advantageous respiratory effects-Bronchodilation, with attenuation of bronchospasm and decreased airway responsiveness. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Respiratory effects'.)-Pulmonary anti-inflammatory effects (eg, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine release) that may minimize the extent of lung injury [23-27]. (See ""One lung ventilation: General principles"", section on 'Intravenous versus inhalation anesthetics'.)•Dose-dependent muscle relaxation during mechanical ventilation. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Skeletal and smooth muscle relaxation'.)●Disadvantages•Scant safety data regarding use of inhalation anesthetic agents for prolonged periods in critically ill patients. However, long-term sedation with sevoflurane or isoflurane has been employed in some nations for sedation of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other critical illness, without evidence of renal or hepatic injury [26-30].•Rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents occurs due to high FGF. Thus, hourly inspection of the anesthetic vaporizer fill level and analysis of end-tidal anesthetic concentration are particularly important. (See 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' above.)•Potential for inadequate sedation due to a vaporizer running dry, particularly if the patient has received a neuromuscular blocking agent. Thus, the patient and anesthesia machine and anesthetic vaporizer must be carefully monitored. •Potential difficulty with connection of the anesthesia machine scavenger systems to compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets in settings outside an operating room (OR). (See 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above.)•Lack of familiarity among non-anesthesia personnel caring for critically ill patients with ARDS (eg, intensivists, nurses, respiratory therapists) regarding use of anesthesia machines to administer volatile inhalation anesthetic agents, dosing of these agents, and potential pitfalls that may occur during their administration (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [16]. •Need for constant presence of anesthesia personnel as recommended by the ASA and APSF (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients) [16].  •Potentially undesirable systemic effects of a potent volatile anesthetic agent in critically ill patients, including:-Cardiovascular effects (eg, myocardial depression and vasodilatory properties that result in dose-dependent reductions in blood pressure and cardiac output). (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Cardiovascular effects'.)-Adverse respiratory effects including airway irritation, particularly with the more pungent agents such as isoflurane, as well as respiratory depression. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Respiratory effects'.)-Cerebral effects (eg, dose-dependent cerebral vasodilation, with blunting of cerebral autoregulation by uncoupling cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism, thereby increasing CBF and intracranial pressure (ICP). Thus, patients with known or suspected elevations in ICP are not candidates for sedation with inhalation anesthetic agents. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Effects on cerebral physiology'.)•Although rare, potential for potent inhalation anesthetic agents to cause malignant hyperthermia. (See ""Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses"", section on 'Malignant hyperthermia (volatile inhalation agents)'.)COLLABORATION WITH CRITICAL CARE CONSULTANTS — Collaboration and coordination with critical care clinicians is essential for care of COVID-19 patients regarding the initial decision to use an anesthesia machine, and for management of long-term ventilation and comorbidities in each critically ill COVID-19 patient (eg, cardiovascular and renal complications, coinfection with sepsis) [31-35]. These issues are discussed in detail in separate topics:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Contamination of an anesthesia machine, its breathing system and ventilator, and its connected gas analyzer is more likely during use as an intensive care ventilator compared with use during surgical procedures for patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or nCoV) infection because of the duration and extent of machine exposure. However, if two filters are used (eg, a heat and moisture exchange filter [HMEF] containing an electrostatic filter placed at the airway plus a mechanical pleated filter placed at the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit), the combined viral filtration efficiency (VFE) is very high, rendering contamination of the anesthesia machine unlikely, even when used for multiple days (with fresh filters each day). (See 'Prevention of anesthesia machine contamination' above.)●Locations selected for use of anesthesia machines to ventilate COVID-19 patients will be institution-dependent depending on layout of selected hospital area(s), location of rooms with negative pressure capabilities, availability of sources of high-pressure oxygen and medical air, availability of compatible connections from the scavenger system to waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets when inhalation anesthetic agents are used, and availability of anesthesia personnel to manage the anesthesia machines. (See 'Locations for anesthesia machines' above.)●The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have developed guidance for repurposing of anesthesia machines for longer-term ventilation (refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance on Purposing Anesthesia Machines as ICU Ventilators and Quick Reference: Setup and Monitoring Instructions – Anesthesia Machine as an ICU Ventilator). Although newer anesthesia ventilators incorporate multiple controlled and assisted modes of ventilation that are nearly identical to ventilators in the intensive care unit (ICU), several important technical issues are unique to anesthesia machines during such use (see 'Differences between anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators' above):•The age and specific capabilities of individual anesthesia machines (newer anesthesia machines have more flexible capabilities and can deliver more modes of ventilation).•The need to adjust fresh gas flow (FGF) to prevent condensed water accumulation in the breathing circuit.•The need for long-term humification and warming of inspired gases.•The need for two high-quality viral filters (one at the airway and on the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit (figure 1)).•The need to understand how settings and performance of anesthesia machine ventilators can be different from those of ICU ventilators.•Potential need to modify default ventilator parameters and alarm settings.•The potential for the carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbent to expire.•The potential for the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration in the breathing circuit to be lower than the set oxygen gas concentration on the anesthesia machine (FgO2).•The need to prevent accidental administration of inhalation anesthetic agents, if inhalation anesthetics are not administered to achieve patient sedation.•Potential need to adjust the scavenger system to prevent backpressure in the breathing system if the anesthesia machine is used outside of an operating room (OR).•The need for periodic performance of an anesthesia machine self-test (ie, power-up test) approximately every 24 to 72 hours.•The need to periodically check the breathing circuit for possible kinking or compression.•The need to minimize potential for errors in setup of anesthesia machines, initiation of controlled ventilation, and respiratory monitoring in locations outside the OR, ideally by deploying multiple machines of the same model within any one hospital unit.●An anesthesia professional should be available to start and monitor ventilation and overall anesthesia machine function (see 'Monitoring long-term ventilation' above):•Continuously or intermittently monitored patient parameters (with preset alarms) that are checked and recorded each hour include (see 'Patient monitoring' above):-Inspired oxygen concentration -Inspired and expired CO2-Inspiratory pressure-Tidal volume and respiratory rate-Low oxygen pressure alarm-Check Pplat at least once every four hours, and after each change in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or tidal volume-Check the flow readings approximately every four hours -Confirm there is no leak around the endotracheal tube cuff every hour •Intermittently machine monitoring includes inspection of (see 'Machine maintenance and monitoring' above):-Breathing circuit hoses and water trap for excessive condensed water every hour.-Breathing circuit hoses for possible kinking or compression every hour-Airway and expiratory limb breathing circuit filters every hour for excessive humidity or secretions-CO2 absorbent color and inspired CO2 values every hour -Documentation of anesthesia machine startup test performance once every 24 to 72 hours ●Although intravenous sedative-analgesic regimens are usually employed to sedate critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation, institutions with shortages of these intravenous agents may consider using low doses of a potent volatile inhalation anesthetic agent for long-term sedation (ie, sevoflurane [0.5 to 1.4%] or isoflurane [0.2 to 0.7%]; refer to the APSF/ASA Guidance for Use of Volatile Anesthetic for Sedation of ICU Patients). (See 'Use of inhalation anesthetics for sedation' above and 'Dosing to achieve sedation' above.)●Advantages and disadvantages of use of inhalation anesthetic agents in this setting include (see 'Advantages and disadvantages' above):•Advantages -Effective sedative effects, with rapid onset and offset allowing easy titratability-Minimal metabolism and likely minimal organ toxicity-Readily available-Advantageous respiratory effects including bronchodilation and possible pulmonary anti-inflammatory effects -Dose-dependent muscle relaxation•Disadvantages -Scant safety data regarding use of inhalation anesthetic agents for prolonged periods-Lack of familiarity among non-anesthesia personnel caring for critically ill patients -Need for constant presence of anesthesia personnel -Rapid utilization of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents due to high FGF, with the potential for inadequate sedation-Potential difficulty with connection of the anesthesia machine scavenger systems to compatible waste anesthesia gas disposal outlets-Potentially undesirable cardiovascular, respiratory, or cerebral effects of potent volatile anesthetic agents in critically ill patients-Although rare, potential for malignant hyperthermia ●Specialized additional monitoring is necessary if inhalation anesthetics are administered for long-term sedation, requiring the constant presence of an anesthesia provider and specialized monitoring that includes (see 'Monitoring during sedation with inhalation anesthetics' above):•Patient parameters (see 'Patient monitoring during sedation' above):-End-tidal anesthetic concentration, with low and high alarms-Exhaled end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2)-Temperature-Hemodynamic monitoring per usual standards for an individual critically ill patient-Serum creatinine and liver function tests at appropriate intervals•Equipment monitoring (see 'Equipment monitoring during sedation' above):-The fill level of anesthetic vaporizers is checked every hour -Proper functioning of the scavenging system is confirmed initially, then every 24 hours or after major changes in FGF rate●Collaboration and coordination with critical care clinicians is essential regarding the initial decision for long-term ventilation with an anesthesia ventilator, and for management of ventilation and comorbidities in each critically ill patient (eg, cardiovascular and renal complications, coinfection with sepsis).

ID:127926,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability,"INTRODUCTION — A novel coronavirus was identified in late 2019 that rapidly reached pandemic proportions. The World Health Organization has designated the disease caused by the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Individuals with COVID-19 may have a number of coagulation abnormalities (in the direction of an underlying hypercoagulable state), raising questions about appropriate evaluations and interventions to prevent or treat thrombosis. Interim guidance has been published by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), and frequently asked questions are posted on the websites of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC).This topic reviews evaluation and management of coagulation abnormalities in individuals with COVID-19.Separate topics discuss the following:●General management – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●Critical care – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)●Pregnancy – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●Anesthesia – (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is incompletely understood.Virchow's triad — Hypercoagulability can be thought of in terms of Virchow's triad (see ""Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis"", section on 'Virchow's triad'). All three of the major contributions to clot formation apply to severe COVID-19 infection:●Endothelial injury – There is evidence of direct invasion of endothelial cells by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, potentially leading to cell injury. Other sources of endothelial injury include intravascular catheters and mediators of the acute systemic inflammatory response such as cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-6) and other acute phase reactants [1]. The contribution of complement-mediated endothelial injury has been suggested [2]. (See ""The endothelium: A primer"" and ""Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention"" and ""Acute phase reactants"".)●Stasis – Immobilization can cause stasis of blood flow in all hospitalized and critically ill patients, regardless of whether they have COVID-19.●Hypercoagulable state – A number of changes in circulating prothrombotic factors have been reported or proposed in patients with severe COVID-19 [3,4]:•Elevated factor VIII •Elevated fibrinogen•Circulating prothrombotic microparticles•Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)Very elevated levels of D-dimer have been observed that correlate with illness severity; D-dimer is a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin indicating augmented thrombin generation and fibrin dissolution by plasmin. However, high D-dimer levels are common in acutely ill individuals with a number of infectious and inflammatory diseases. Likewise, antiphospholipid antibodies, which can prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), are common in viral infections, but they are often transient and do not always imply an increased risk of thrombosis. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' below and 'Clinical features' below.) Coagulation abnormalities — The predominant coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 suggest a hypercoagulable state and are consistent with uncontrolled clinical observations of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (see 'VTE' below). This state has been termed thromboinflammation or COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) by some experts [5,6]. It appears to be distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), though DIC has been reported in severely affected patients.Laboratory findings were characterized in a series of 24 selected patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (intubated) who were evaluated along with standard coagulation testing and other assays including von Willebrand factor (VWF) and thromboelastography (TEG) [3]:●Coagulation testing•Prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT normal or slightly prolonged•Platelet counts normal or increased (mean, 348,000/microL)•Fibrinogen increased (mean, 680 mg/dL; range 234 to 1344)•D-dimer increased (mean, 4877 ng/mL; range, 1197 to 16,954)●Other assays•Factor VIII activity increased (mean, 297 units/dL)•VWF antigen greatly increased (mean, 529; range 210 to 863), consistent with endothelial injury or perturbation•Minor changes in natural anticoagulants-Small decreases in antithrombin and free protein S-Small increase in protein C ●TEG findings•Reaction time (R) shortened, consistent with increased early thrombin burst, in 50 percent of patients•Clot formation time (K) shortened, consistent with increased fibrin generation, in 83 percent•Maximum amplitude (MA) increased, consistent with greater clot strength, in 83 percent•Clot lysis at 30 minutes (LY30) reduced, consistent with reduced fibrinolysis, in 100 percentTesting in this study was performed on arterial blood because the patients had arterial catheters in place, but venous blood can be used. Heparinase was included since most patients were receiving low molecular weight (LMW) heparin. Other studies have reported similar findings consistent with a hypercoagulable state, including very high D-dimer, VWF antigen and activity, and factor VIII activity [4,7]. One study suggested that patients with COVID-19 have higher platelet counts than patients with other coronavirus infections [8]. Early case series, including a series of 183 consecutive patients from Wuhan, China, suggested that thrombocytopenia and prolongation of the PT and aPTT were more marked [9-12]. It is not clear why these results differed somewhat from later findings of less severe PT and aPTT prolongation. One possible explanation is that these patients were sicker, perhaps because earlier in the pandemic the disease was not recognized as quickly, resulting in delays in patient presentation and/or treatment.Another explanation for an isolated prolonged aPTT is the presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LA) (see ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Causes of prolonged aPTT'). Two studies have found a high rate of LA in patients with prolonged aPTT (50 of 57 tested individuals [88 percent] and 31 of 34 tested individuals [91 percent]) [13,14]. The presence of an LA may lead to an artifactual prolongation of the aPTT but does not reflect an increased bleeding risk; patients with an LA should receive anticoagulation if indicated. (See 'Management' below.) Some of the markers of deranged coagulation (eg, D-dimer) appear to correlate with illness severity. D-dimer is often increased, sometimes markedly, in individuals with overt DIC and those in the intensive care unit (ICU). Principles of TEG and interpretation of TEG tracings are illustrated in the figure (figure 1) and discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Platelet function testing"", section on 'Thromboelastography (TEG) and ROTEM' and ""Acute coagulopathy associated with trauma"", section on 'Thromboelastography'.)Distinction from DIC — The hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 has been referred to by some as a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like state, especially because many affected individuals are acutely ill and meet criteria for probable DIC in a scoring system published by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) in 2009 [15]. However, the major clinical finding in COVID-19 is thrombosis, whereas the major finding in acute decompensated DIC is bleeding.Likewise, COVID-19 has some similar laboratory findings to DIC, including a marked increase in D-dimer and in some cases, mild thrombocytopenia. However, other coagulation parameters in COVID-19 are distinct from DIC. In COVID-19, the typical findings include high fibrinogen and high factor VIII activity, suggesting that major consumption of coagulation factors is not occurring [3]. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above.)In contrast, acute decompensated DIC is associated with low fibrinogen due to consumption of clotting factors. In one of the largest series that reported on thromboembolic events, none of the patients developed overt DIC [16].Typically, bleeding predominates in acute decompensated DIC and thrombosis predominates in chronic compensated DIC, although there is significant overlap. Thus, the hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 is more similar to compensated DIC than to acute DIC. However, in COVID-19, the platelet count and aPTT are typically normal. (See ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Pathogenesis'.)This ISTH scoring system is based on laboratory findings and is only intended for use in patients with an underlying condition known to be associated with DIC [15]. COVID-19 would qualify based on being a severe infection. Points are given for thrombocytopenia (1 point for platelet count 50,000 to 100,000/microL; 2 points for <50,000/microL), prolonged PT (1 point for 3 to 6 seconds of prolongation; 2 points for more than 6 seconds), low fibrinogen (1 point for <100 mg/dL), and increased D-dimer (2 points for moderate increase; 3 points for ""strong"" increase). A score of 5 or more points suggests DIC is probable. Despite this, the diagnosis of DIC is made clinically; there is no gold standard and no single test or combination of tests that is pathognomonic. Compared with expert opinion, the ISTH scoring system is reported to have a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 97 percent [15]. (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above.)Regardless of whether the differences from DIC or the similarities are emphasized, many of the basic principles of DIC management apply, including the importance of treating the underlying condition, the importance of basing interventions on the clinical picture rather than on laboratory testing alone, and the need to provide anticoagulation for thrombosis and appropriate hemostatic therapies for bleeding. (See ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Treatment'.)CLINICAL FEATURESVTE — Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is very common in acutely ill patients with COVID-19, seen in up to one-third of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), even when prophylactic anticoagulation is used. Two autopsy studies emphasize the contributions of hypercoagulability and associated inflammation in patients who die from COVID-19:●Post-mortem examination of 21 individuals with COVID-19 found prominent PE in four, with microthrombi in alveolar capillaries in 5 of 11 (45 percent) who had available histology [17]. Three had evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy with fibrin thrombi in glomerular capillaries. The average age was 76 years, and most had a high body mass index (BMI; mean, 31 kg/m2; normal 18.5 to <25). Information on use of anticoagulation prior to death was available for 11, and all 11 were receiving some form of anticoagulation. Underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were common.●Post-mortem examination of 12 consecutive individuals with COVID-19 (8 male; 10 hospitalized) revealed DVT in 7 of 12 (58 percent) [18]. All cases of DVT had bilateral leg involvement, and none were suspected before death. Of the 12 for whom lung histology was available, 5 (42 percent) had evidence of thrombosis. PE was the cause of death in four. In those who had D-dimer testing, some had extremely high values (two >20,000 ng/mL and one >100,000 ng/mL; normal value <500 ng/mL [<500 mcg/L]). Use of anticoagulation prior to death was only reported in 4 of the 12. The mean BMI was 28.7 kg/m2; only three patients had a normal BMI, and they had cancer, ulcerative colitis, and/or chronic kidney disease. Both of these studies noted the preponderance of males with a high prevalence of obesity and other chronic medical comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. ICU — Case series of intensive care unit (ICU) patients have reported high rates of VTE (range, 20 to 43 percent), mostly pulmonary embolism (PE), and often despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation: ●A series of 184 sequential patients with severe COVID-19 in the ICU reported PE in 25 (14 percent), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 1, and catheter-associated thrombosis in 2 [16]. The cumulative incidence of VTE (based on different durations of follow-up) was calculated at 27 percent. All were receiving at least standard dose thromboprophylaxis. The group as a whole was very ill, with 13 percent requiring renal replacement therapy and 13 percent mortality. Three-fourths of the patients were male, and several had active cancer (independent VTE risk factors). ●A series of 150 ICU patients reported VTE in 64 (43 percent, mostly PE) and clotting of the extracorporeal circuit in 28 of 29 receiving continuous renal replacement therapy and 2 of 12 undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [7]. All patients were receiving thromboprophylaxis (mostly low molecular weight [LMW] heparin), 70 percent with prophylactic dose and 30 percent with therapeutic dose. This study also compared the subgroup of 77 patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to a matched cohort of 145 patients with non-COVID-19-ARDS and found the rate of thrombotic complications (mostly PE) to be higher in the COVID-19 patients (12 versus 2 percent).●A series of 107 ICU patients reported PE in 22 (21 percent; cumulative incidence at 15 days, 20 percent) [19]. Of the 22 patients with PE, 20 were receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 2 were receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (for prior VTE and atrial fibrillation). By comparison, the incidence of PE in two matched cohorts (one from the same time interval in the previous year and one from concurrent patients with influenza rather than COVID-19) were 6 and 8 percent, respectively.●A series that included 74 ICU patients reported VTE in 29 (39 percent), with a cumulative incidence of 25 percent at 7 days and 48 percent at 14 days [20]. All of these individuals were receiving anticoagulation, most at prophylactic levels. None of the patients receiving therapeutic level anticoagulation at admission developed VTE.●An earlier series of 81 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia reported VTE in 20 (25 percent) [21].●A study that performed screening leg ultrasounds in 26 individuals with COVID-19 in the ICU who were all receiving either prophylactic-dose or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation found VTE in 18 (69 percent), including bilateral clots in 10 (38 percent) [22]. Some of these individuals had additional VTE risk factors including cancer, recent surgery, high BMI, or prior VTE; 7 (27 percent) were receiving anticoagulation prior to admission.VTE risk is in the range where some experts would suggest more aggressive thromboprophylaxis dosing of anticoagulants or even empiric therapeutic-dose anticoagulation for VTE prevention. Some of these studies noted a higher than average body mass index in affected individuals, suggesting that obesity, along with other risk factors, may warrant consideration in decision-making regarding the intensity of anticoagulation. (See 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below.)Inpatients (non-ICU) — Data are more limited regarding the rate of VTE in inpatients who are not in the intensive care unit (ICU). The series with a 39 percent rate of VTE in ICU patients above also included 124 non-ICU patients, and of those, only 4 (3 percent) were diagnosed with VTE [20].A series from Ireland that included 50 patients on the regular medical ward reported similar findings to those in ICU patients, including high D-dimer and fibrinogen and normal platelet counts and clotting times [23]. Outpatients — We are aware that thrombotic events have been observed in COVID-19 patients who were not admitted to the hospital, but data on the incidence are not available. Arterial events — There are also reports of arterial thrombosis, including in the central nervous system (CNS). As examples:●CNS – A single health system identified five cases of acute ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19 over a two-week period, with symptoms suggesting large-vessel occlusion; all patients were under 50 years of age [24]. In other time periods before the pandemic, there were approximately 0.7 large vessel strokes per two-week interval in individuals under age 50. In one of the series of ICU patients discussed above, ischemic stroke was observed in 3 of 184 (cumulative incidence, 3.7 percent) [16]. In another one of the series discussed above, cerebral ischemia was seen in 3 of 150 [7].●Limbs – A report described 20 patients with COVID-19 who developed acute limb ischemia at a single institution over a three-month period [25]. This represented a significant increase in limb ischemia over the previous year (16 percent, versus 2 percent in early 2019). Most were male (18 of 20), and the average age was 75 years. Surgical revascularization procedures were performed in 17, of which 12 (71 percent) were successful, a lower-than-expected success rate. Individuals who received postoperative heparin did not require reintervention, although the benefits of postoperative heparin did not reach statistical significance. Another report described four patients with acute limb ischemia due to thrombosis, two of whom were young and did not have any comorbidities (a 53-year-old man who developed aorto-iliac thrombosis and a 37-year-old man who developed humeral artery thrombosis) [26]. Both were receiving prophylactic-dose LMW heparin at the time thrombosis developed and both had very high D-dimer (>9000 ng/mL). Myocardial infarction has also been reported but not emphasized in available series.Microvascular thrombosis — Autopsy studies in some individuals who have died from COVID-19 have demonstrated microvascular thrombosis in the lungs [2,6]. The mechanism is unclear and may involve hypercoagulability, direct endothelial injury, complement activation, or other processes. In the absence of more definitive data regarding mechanisms or therapy, we would not pursue specialized testing for thrombotic microangiopathies (eg, ADAMTS13 activity, complement studies) or specialized therapies (eg, plasma exchange, anti-complement therapy) outside of a research study.Bleeding — Bleeding is less common than clotting in patients with COVID-19, but it may occur, especially in the setting of anticoagulation. As an example, in a subset of 25 ICU patients who were evaluated for abnormal neurologic findings, one had evidence of intracranial hemorrhage as well as ischemic lesions [7]. Three other patients in this series also had hemorrhagic complications, including two intracerebral bleeds associated with head trauma and one with hemorrhagic complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Three others in this series had evidence of intracerebral ischemia. (See 'Arterial events' above.)EVALUATION — The evaluation of patients with COVID-19 and coagulation abnormalities (suspected or documented) can be challenging due to the limited data on which clinical parameters or coagulation abnormalities should be acted upon and the concerns related to performing diagnostic imaging procedures on acutely ill and potentially contagious patients. A general approach is as follows, although other decisions may be made by the treating clinicians based on their evaluation of the patient. This approach is consistent with guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the American Society of Hematology (ASH), and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) [5,27,28]. Routine testing (all patients)●Inpatients – We assess the following in inpatients with COVID-19:•Complete blood count (CBC) including platelet count•Coagulation studies (prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT])•Fibrinogen•D-dimerRepeat testing is reasonable on a daily basis or less frequently, depending on the acuity of the patient's illness, the initial result, and the trend in values. Measurement of the D-dimer more than once per day is generally not indicated.As noted above, common laboratory findings include (see 'Coagulation abnormalities' above):•High D-dimer •High fibrinogen•Normal or mildly prolonged PT and aPTT•Mild thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, or normal platelet countWe do not intervene for these abnormal coagulation studies in the absence of clinical indications. However, these findings may have prognostic value and may impact decision-making about the level of care and/or investigational therapies directed at treating the infection. As an example, increasing D-dimer is associated with poor prognosis. (See 'Investigational therapies' below.)Atypical findings such as a markedly prolonged aPTT (out of proportion to the PT), low fibrinogen, or severe thrombocytopenia suggest that another condition may be present and additional evaluation may be indicated. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)We do not routinely test for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), other thrombotic microangiopathies, or antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). There are no therapeutic implications of transiently positive aPL in the absence of clinical findings. Transient aPL positivity is often seen in acute infections. (See ""Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome"", section on 'Other conditions associated with aPL'.)We do not routinely perform imaging for screening purposes, as there is no evidence that indicates this practice improves outcomes, and it may unnecessarily expose health care workers to additional infectious risks. However, imaging is appropriate in individuals with symptoms, as discussed below. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)●Outpatients – For outpatients, routine coagulation testing is not required. Evaluation of abnormal symptoms or findings on examination is similar to inpatients. (See 'Role of additional testing' below.)Role of additional testingDiagnosis of DVT or PE — Evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) may be challenging because symptoms of PE overlap with COVID-19, and imaging studies may not be feasible in all cases. The threshold for evaluation or diagnosis of DVT or PE should be low given the high frequency of these events and the presence of additional venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factors in many individuals. (See 'VTE' above.) ●DVT – Individuals with suspected DVT should have compression ultrasonography when feasible according to standard indications. (See ""Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity"".)●PE – We agree with guidance from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) regarding diagnosis of PE, which includes the following [29]:•A normal D-dimer is sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of PE. An increase in D-dimer is not specific for VTE and is not sufficient to make the diagnosis.•In patients with suspected PE due to unexplained hypotension, tachycardia, worsening respiratory status, or other risk factors for thrombosis, computed tomography with pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred test to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is an alternative if CTPA cannot be performed or is inconclusive, although V/Q scan may be unhelpful in individuals with significant pulmonary involvement from COVID-19. Consultation with the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) in decision-making is advised if possible. (See ""Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism"".)The role of full-dose anticoagulation if CTPA or V/Q scan is not feasible is discussed below. (See 'Documented or presumed VTE' below.)Infection control procedures should be followed in patients undergoing imaging studies. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)Evaluation of atypical laboratory findings — As noted above, typical laboratory findings of COVID-19 are monitored for their prognostic value. (See 'Routine testing (all patients)' above.)Laboratory findings that are atypical for COVID-19, such as severe thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count <50,000/microL), a prolonged aPTT out of proportion to the PT, or a markedly reduced fibrinogen, should be evaluated as done for individuals without COVID-19, as discussed in separate topic reviews:●Thrombocytopenia – (See ""Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia"".)●Abnormal coagulation tests – (See ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Evaluation of abnormal results'.)Evaluation of bleeding — The evaluation is discussed separately. (See ""Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"" and ""Clinical use of coagulation tests"", section on 'Patient on anticoagulant'.)Management of bleeding depends on the underlying cause. (See 'Treatment of bleeding' below.)MANAGEMENTOverview of management considerations — Management can be challenging. Hypercoagulability appears to adversely impact prognosis, but there are no high-quality studies to support interventions that go beyond standard indications, and antithrombotic therapies carry risks of increased bleeding [30]. In the absence of high-quality data to guide management, institutions may vary in how aggressively they approach prevention and treatment of thromboembolic complications. Enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged to help determine the best approach [31]. Regardless of clinical trial enrollment, adherence to institutional protocols and input from individuals with expertise in hemostasis and thrombosis is advised to balance the risks of thrombosis and bleeding and guide decisions about antithrombotic therapy; bleeding caused by administration of excessive antithrombotic therapy may require prothrombotic treatments that further increase thrombotic risk.Acknowledging the lack of evidence, we agree with interim guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) [27,32]. Our approach is summarized in the table (table 1) and discussed in the following sections.Management of coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Additional measures' and ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Inpatient VTE prophylaxis●Indications – Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is appropriate in all hospitalized medical, surgical, and obstetric patients with COVID-19 (algorithm 1), unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, active bleeding or serious bleeding in the prior 24 to 48 hours) or to the use of heparin (eg, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT], in which case an alternative agent such as fondaparinux may be used).•ICU – All patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) require thromboprophylaxis. As discussed below, some would empirically use intermediate-dose or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in severely ill individuals in the absence of documented VTE. (See 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below.)•Medical (non-ICU) – All hospitalized medical patients should be treated with prophylactic-dose low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (or unfractionated heparin if LMW heparin is unavailable) for thromboprophylaxis. •Surgical – Perioperative VTE prophylaxis is especially important for patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized for a surgical procedure. Details of the timing and choice of agent are discussed separately. (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult orthopedic surgical patients"" and ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in adult nonorthopedic surgical patients"".)•Obstetric – We would also use VTE prophylaxis in obstetric patients with COVID-19 who are in the hospital prior to or following delivery. LMW heparin is appropriate if delivery is not expected within 24 hours and after delivery; unfractionated heparin is used if faster discontinuation is needed (eg, if delivery, neuraxial anesthesia, or an invasive procedure is anticipated within approximately 12 to 24 hours or at 36 to 37 weeks of gestation). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Medical and obstetric care of hospitalized patients' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)●Dosing – Dosing (subcutaneous) is generally as follows; however, many experts are recommending higher doses for critically ill individuals, especially those in the ICU (see 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' below):•Enoxaparin – For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30 mL/min, 40 mg once daily; for CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min, 30 mg once daily.•Dalteparin – 5000 units once daily.•Nadroparin – For patients ≤70 kg, 3800 or 4000 anti-factor Xa units once daily; for patients >70 kg, 5700 units once daily. In some cases, doses up to 50 anti-factor Xa units/kg every 12 hours are used. •Tinzaparin – 4500 anti-factor Xa units once daily.For patients with CrCl <15 mL/min or renal replacement therapy, we use unfractionated heparin, which is much less dependent on elimination by the kidney. The tables have more information about adjustments for kidney impairment (table 2), obesity (table 3), and pregnancy (table 4).●Supporting evidence – LMW heparin is known to reduce the risk of VTE and may have antiinflammatory properties. In a retrospective series of 2773 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, in whom 786 (28 percent) received systemic anticoagulation, anticoagulation was associated with improved in-hospital survival in intubated patients (71 percent, versus 37 percent for those who were not anticoagulated) [33]. Intubated patients represented approximately 14 percent of the cohort; in the cohort as a whole, anticoagulation was not associated with better in-hospital survival (78 versus 77 percent). Bleeding events occurred in 3 percent of the anticoagulated patients and 2 percent of those who were not anticoagulated (not a statistically significant difference).In a retrospective study of 449 individuals with severe COVID-19, enoxaparin (40 to 60 mg once daily) appeared to be associated with improved survival when compared with no pharmacologic prophylaxis, especially in those with a high D-dimer [12]. •The survival difference was only seen in a subset of individuals with a high sepsis-induced coagulopathy score (28-day mortality, 40 percent with heparin versus 64 percent without) or a high D-dimer, not in the cohort as a whole. •The magnitude of benefit was greater in those with higher D-dimer values. The reduced mortality became statistically significant at six times the upper limit of normal (33 versus 52 percent). One small series (16 patients) used higher prophylactic doses of nadroparin along with clopidogrel and did not report any VTE events; the small size of the study and lack of a control group limits interpretation [4]. As discussed above, a high percentage (25 to 43 percent) of individuals with COVID-19 in the ICU had VTE despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, prompting many experts to suggest higher doses. (See 'VTE' above and 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation' below.)One study monitored antithrombin (AT) levels and provided AT concentrate for those with decreased levels [4]. However, we generally would not measure AT levels or consider AT concentrate unless an individual was known to have inherited AT deficiency or exhibited heparin resistance in association with a very low AT level. (See ""Antithrombin deficiency"", section on 'Heparin resistance'.)Indications for full-dose anticoagulation — Therapeutic-dose (full-dose) anticoagulation (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours) is appropriate in the following settings, unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, active bleeding or serious bleeding in the prior 24 to 48 hours) or to the use of heparin (eg, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT], in which case an alternative agent such as fondaparinux may be used) (algorithm 1):Documented or presumed VTE — Therapeutic-dose (full-dose) anticoagulation is appropriate for documented venous thromboembolism (VTE), similar to individuals without COVID-19. (See 'Diagnosis of DVT or PE' above.)Full-dose anticoagulation is also reasonable in some cases of suspected VTE in which standard confirmatory testing is not available or feasible, including the following: ●In patients for whom computed tomography with pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is not feasible, the following may be sufficient to initiate treatment:•Confirmation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using bilateral compression ultrasonography of the legs.•Transthoracic echocardiography or point-of-care ultrasound that demonstrates clot in transit in the main pulmonary artery.●In patients for whom no confirmatory testing is possible, it may be reasonable to treat empirically with full-dose anticoagulation based on one or more of the following:•Sudden deterioration in respiratory status in an intubated patient consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE), especially when chest radiography and/or inflammatory markers are stable or improving and the change cannot be attributed to a cardiac cause. •Otherwise unexplained respiratory failure (eg, not due to fluid overload or acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), especially if the fibrinogen and/or D-dimer is very high. •Physical findings consistent with thrombosis (superficial thrombophlebitis or retiform purpura not explained by other conditions).For patients with acute VTE who are discharged from the hospital, extended thromboprophylaxis may be reasonable. (See 'Patients discharged from the hospital' below.) Clotting of intravascular access devices — Full-dose anticoagulation is appropriate for individuals with recurrent clotting of intravascular access devices (arterial lines, central venous catheters) despite prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation.Full-dose anticoagulation is also appropriate in those with clotting in extracorporeal circuits (continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). Details are discussed separately. (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients — The question of treatment-dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis has also been raised in critically ill individuals and those in the ICU who have not had confirmed or suspected acute VTE but are at high risk, as described above. (See 'VTE' above.)Many centers are recommending intermediate-dose or even therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation in these individuals (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Venous thromboembolism prevention'). There are no data comparing different levels of anticoagulation in these patients (prophylactic, intermediate, or therapeutic dosing), and clinical trials are in progress. Enrollment in such a trial is encouraged. As stated by the American Society of Hematology (ASH), empiric full-dose anticoagulation for individuals who do not have VTE remains controversial, since data demonstrating improved outcomes are lacking, and some of the risk factors for VTE are also risk factors for increased risk of bleeding [29]. Thus, if VTE is suspected, confirmatory testing should be obtained or other indications for full-dose anticoagulation should be sought if possible, especially in individuals who are not in the ICU. This testing and other findings that support therapeutic-dose anticoagulation are discussed above. (See 'Diagnosis of DVT or PE' above.)Indications for tPA — Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is appropriate for usual indications, unless there is a contraindication:●Limb-threatening DVT – (See ""Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy in deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity: Patient selection and administration"".)●Massive PE – (See ""Approach to thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) therapy in acute pulmonary embolism: Patient selection and administration"".)●Acute stroke – (See ""Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke"".)  ●Acute myocardial infarction – (See ""Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: The use of fibrinolytic therapy"".) Consultation with the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) or stroke team in decision-making is advised if possible. In contrast, we are not using tPA in individuals with nonspecific findings such as hypoxia or laboratory evidence of hypercoagulability. A case series described administration of tPA to three individuals with ARDS associated with COVID-19 who did not have access to or were not eligible for other interventions such as ECMO [34]. One individual had transient improvement in laboratory parameters but ultimately died. The other two had improvement in laboratory parameters; clinical outcomes were not described.Outpatient thromboprophylaxisPatients discharged from the hospital — Individuals with documented VTE require a minimum of three months of anticoagulation, as discussed separately. (See ""Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"", section on 'Duration of therapy' and ""Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults"".)Some individuals who have not had a VTE may also warrant extended thromboprophylaxis following discharge from the hospital:●We would be most likely to use post-discharge prophylactic anticoagulation in individuals with other risk factors for VTE such as immobilization, recent surgery, or trauma. ●We would use other criteria similar to those used in the APEX and MARINER trials, including immobility and older age. Most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 would meet these criteria. ●However, bleeding risk also needs to be incorporated into decision-making. ●Options for post-discharge prophylaxis include those used in clinical trials, such as rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 31 to 39 days [35]. This subject is discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults"", section on 'Duration of prophylaxis'.) Patients not admitted to the hospital — Outpatient thromboprophylaxis may also be appropriate for selected individuals with COVID-19 who are not admitted to the hospital, especially those with other thrombotic risk factors such as prior VTE or recent surgery, trauma, or immobilization, noting that this practice is based on clinical judgment. There are no trials that address thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19.If thromboprophylaxis is used in an outpatient, we would use a regimen such as rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 31 to 39 days [35]. Treatment of bleeding — Bleeding does not appear to be a major manifestation of COVID-19. However, patients may have bleeding for other reasons, including trauma and/or treatment with anticoagulation. (See 'Bleeding' above.)The approach to bleeding is similar to individuals without COVID-19 and may involve anticoagulant reversal and/or discontinuation, transfusions for thrombocytopenia or hypofibrinogenemia, or specific therapies such as factor replacement.●Anticoagulant-associated bleeding – (See ""Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR"" and ""Management of bleeding in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants"" and ""Reversal of anticoagulation in intracranial hemorrhage"".)●Trauma coagulopathy – (See ""Acute coagulopathy associated with trauma"".)●An underlying bleeding disorder such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), hemophilia, or von Willebrand disease (VWD) – (See ""Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Initial treatment and prognosis"" and ""Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B"" and ""von Willebrand disease (VWD): Treatment of major bleeding and major surgery"".)Antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, epsilon aminocaproic acid) are generally not used in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), due to the concern that they may tip the balance towards thrombosis. Thus, they should be avoided in patients in whom the COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state is the predominant finding. (See 'Distinction from DIC' above and ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults: Evaluation and management"", section on 'Prevention/treatment of bleeding'.)Fibrinogen is often increased in COVID-19, and supplementation with fibrinogen is not required unless there is bleeding that is attributable to hypofibrinogenemia or dysfibrinogenemia (fibrinogen activity level <150 to 200 mg/dL). (See 'Coagulation abnormalities' above and ""Disorders of fibrinogen"", section on 'Treatment/prevention of bleeding'.)Investigational therapies — A number of therapies for COVID-19 are under investigation, some of which may impact thrombotic risk. However, effects of these treatments on hemostasis in this patient population have not been well studied. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Participation in clinical trials is encouraged in order to improve understanding of the most effective and safest means of preventing and treating thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Investigational therapies may be appropriate in life-threatening situations or as part of a clinical trial, and markedly increased D-dimer may be used as one criterion for identifying individuals with a worse prognosis. Close monitoring for clinical signs of thrombosis or bleeding is advised in all individuals with COVID-19, with input from an individual with expertise in hemostasis and thrombosis in those with severe or unusual presentations.SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"") ●Society guidelines for patients (see ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a hypercoagulable state associated with acute inflammatory changes and laboratory findings that are distinct from acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), save for those with very severe disease. Fibrinogen and D-dimer are increased, with typically only modest prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and mild thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia. The presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LA) is common in individuals with a prolonged aPTT. The pathogenesis of these abnormalities is incompletely understood, and there may be many contributing factors related to the acute inflammatory response to the disease. (See 'Pathogenesis' above.)●The risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is markedly increased, especially in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), with case series reporting prevalences of 25 to 43 percent in ICU patients, often despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. The risk for other thrombotic events (stroke, microvascular thrombosis) is less clear. (See 'Clinical features' above.)●All patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 should have a baseline complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer. Repeat testing is done according to the patient's clinical status. Outpatients do not require coagulation testing. The main purpose of this testing is to obtain prognostic information that may be used to inform level of care. (See 'Routine testing (all patients)' above.)●Imaging studies are appropriate for suspected VTE if feasible. If standard diagnostic studies are not feasible, other options for determining the need for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation are available, as discussed above. Laboratory abnormalities that are not typical of COVID-19 should be further evaluated, as described above. (See 'Role of additional testing' above.)●Management is challenging due to the acuity of the illness and a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding efficacy and safety of different approaches to prevent or treat thromboembolic complications of the disease. Our general approach, which is summarized in the table (table 1) and depicted in the algorithm (algorithm 1), includes:•All inpatients should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin is preferred, but unfractionated heparin can be used if LMW heparin is unavailable or if kidney function is severely impaired. Some institutional protocols include more aggressive anticoagulation with intermediate-dose or even therapeutic-dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis. (See 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' above and 'Possible/uncertain role of therapeutic-level anticoagulation for critically ill patients' above.)•Therapeutic-dose (full-dose) anticoagulation is appropriate to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), unless contraindicated. (See 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation' above.)•Bleeding is unusual but can occur. If it occurs, treatment is similar to non-COVID-19 patients and may include transfusions, anticoagulant reversal or discontinuation, or specific products for underlying bleeding disorders. (See 'Treatment of bleeding' above.)•Participation in clinical trials is encouraged in order to improve understanding of the most effective and safest means of preventing and treating thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Disease-specific therapies under investigation may impact thrombotic risk, but the effects of these treatments on hemostasis in this patient population have not been well documented.

In pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia, these early data show approximately the same rate of intensive care unit admissions as their nonpregnant counterparts. However, a few maternal deaths have been reported in the medical literature. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Maternal course'.)Does COVID-19 increase the risk for pregnancy complications?Yes, infected women, especially those who develop pneumonia, appear to have an increased frequency of preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of gestation) and cesarean delivery, which is likely related to severe maternal illness. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Pregnancy complications'.)Does SARS-CoV-2 cross the placenta?There is no definite evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crosses the placenta and infects the fetus; however, a few cases of placental tissue or membranes positive for SARS-CoV-2 and a few cases of possible in utero infection have been reported. The neonatal cases may have been false-positive test results or due to acquisition of infection soon after birth. Reports of COVID-19 infection in the neonate have generally described mild disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Vertical transmission'.)How can prenatal care be modified to decrease risk of contracting COVID-19?The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine support modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits to limit person-to-person contact and thus help prevent spread of COVID-19. Modifications should be tailored for low- versus high-risk pregnancies (eg, multiple gestation, hypertension, diabetes) and may include telehealth, reducing the number of in-person visits, timing of visits, grouping tests (eg, aneuploidy, diabetes, infection screening) to minimize maternal contact with others, restricting visitors during visits and tests, timing of indicated obstetric ultrasound examinations, and timing and frequency of use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Routine prenatal care in uninfected women'.)Should low-dose aspirin be avoided in pregnant women with COVID-19?Concern about possible negative effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for whom low-dose aspirin is indicated (eg, prevention of preeclampsia), ACOG suggests an individualized approach to continuation versus discontinuation. For example, continuing preeclampsia prophylaxis is likely not worthwhile in severely or critically ill patients or near term. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications'.)Should antenatal glucocorticoids be avoided in pregnant women with COVID-19?For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because they have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. However, the CDC have not addressed use of antenatal glucocorticoids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from preterm birth.Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. However, for pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation and at risk of preterm birth within seven days, the benefits to the neonate are less clear, and ACOG has advised not administering a course of betamethasone to such patients. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications'.)LABOR AND DELIVERYIs maternal COVID-19 an indication for cesarean delivery?No, COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery. Even if vertical transmission is confirmed as additional data are reported, this would not be an indication for cesarean delivery since it would increase maternal risk and would be unlikely to improve newborn outcome. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Route of delivery'.)Should planned induction of labor or cesarean delivery of asymptomatic women be postponed during the pandemic?No, in asymptomatic women, inductions of labor and cesarean deliveries with appropriate medical indications should not be postponed or rescheduled. This includes 39-week inductions or cesarean deliveries after patient counseling. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Timing delivery in infected women'.)How should labor pain be managed in women with COVID-19?A neuraxial anesthetic is generally preferred to other options for management of labor pain because it provides good analgesia and thus reduces cardiopulmonary stress from pain and anxiety. In addition, it is available in case an emergency cesarean is required, thus obviating the need for general anesthesia. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) suggests considering suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 because of insufficient data about cleaning, filtering, and potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems. They also urge consideration of limiting use of intravenous patient controlled analgesia because of the risk of respiratory depression. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Analgesia and anesthesia'.)Can an asymptomatic partner/support person attend labor and delivery?Practices vary by institution. At a minimum, the support person should be screened in accordance with hospital policies, and those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. Most facilities recognize that a support person is important to many laboring women and permit one support person who must remain with the laboring woman (may not leave her room and then return). Additional support persons can be a part of the patient's labor and delivery via video. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Infection control precautions'.)POSTPARTUMHow should the baby be evaluated?If the mother has known COVID-19, the infant is a COVID-19 suspect and should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Infant evaluation'.)Should the mother with COVID-19 be separated from her baby?The CDC advise health care facilities to determine whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the mother's clinical condition. Separation is unnecessary if the infant's SARS-CoV-2 testing result is positive. If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, measures to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission should be utilized (eg, physical barriers, mother-baby ≥6 feet separation, maternal use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, use of a healthy adult for infant care). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Mother-baby contact'.)How long should mother-baby precautions at home continue after recent infection?After discharge from the birth facility, a mother with symptomatic COVID-19 infection should maintain a distance of at least six feet from the newborn and use a face mask and hand hygiene for newborn care until (1) at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications plus improvement in respiratory symptoms [cough, shortness of breath]) and (2) at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. For mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have never been symptomatic, transmission precautions can be discontinued when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test. Test-based strategies for discontinuation of precautions are also available. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'After hospital discharge'.)Can breast milk transmit SARS-CoV-2?It is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk because very few breast milk samples have been tested. One report of testing found no virus in the breast milk of six patients and another found virus in one of the three samples of breast milk tested. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)What precautions should mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 take when breastfeeding?Droplet transmission from an infected mother to her baby could occur through close contact during breastfeeding. To minimize direct contact, ideally, the infant should be fed expressed breastmilk by a healthy caregiver following hygiene precautions until the mother has recovered or proven uninfected. In such cases, the mother should use strict handwashing before pumping and wear a face mask during pumping. If this approach is not possible, mothers should take precautions to prevent transmission to the infant during breastfeeding (including hand and breast hygiene and use of a face mask). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)Can postpartum women with COVID-19 take NSAIDs for postpartum analgesia?Concern about possible negative effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs when clinically indicated. Given the uncertainty, we suggest using acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used.

With droplet transmission, virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes. Infection can also occur if a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) and do not linger in the air. In one report, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols under experimental conditions for at least three hours; however, whether this is clinically meaningful is uncertain.While SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in non-respiratory specimens (eg, stool, blood), neither fecal-oral nor bloodborne transmission appear to be significant sources of infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described in animals, but there is no evidence to suggest that animals are a major source of transmission. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)What is the incubation period for COVID-19?The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Incubation period'.)CLINICAL PRESENTATIONWhat are the clinical presentation and natural history of COVID-19?The spectrum of illness associated with COVID-19 is wide, ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening respiratory failure. When symptoms are present, they typically arise approximately four to five days after exposure. Symptoms are mild in approximately 80 percent of cases and often include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Smell and taste disorders have also been reported in patients with COVID-19; whether these symptoms are distinguishing features is unknown. Gastrointestinal symptoms are not frequently reported but may be the presenting feature in some patients. Headache, rhinorrhea, and sore throat are less common. Dyspnea affects approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients, typically arising five to eight days after symptom onset. Progression from dyspnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be rapid; thus, the onset of dyspnea is generally an indication for hospital evaluation and management.Pneumonia is the most common manifestation of severe disease. ARDS develops in a sizable minority of symptomatic patients and can be associated with a cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fever, progressive hypoxia and/or hypotension, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. ARDS is the leading cause of death, followed by sepsis, cardiac complications, and secondary infections. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to be between two and three percent. While severe and fatal illness can occur in anyone, the risk rises dramatically with age and the presence of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and cancer. For those who recover, illness is often prolonged, lasting approximately two weeks in those with mild disease and three to six weeks in those with severe disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Is there a way to distinguish COVID-19 clinically from other respiratory illnesses, particularly influenza?No, the clinical features of COVID-19 overlap substantially with influenza and other respiratory viral illnesses. There is no way to distinguish among them without testing. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features'.)What factors are associated with severe COVID-19?Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but it predominantly occurs in adults with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities. Comorbidities associated with severe illness and mortality include:●Cardiovascular disease●Diabetes mellitus●Hypertension●Chronic lung disease●Cancer●Chronic kidney disease●Obesity (body mass index ≥30)Immunosuppression is also presumed to be a risk factor for severe illness and mortality, but this has not yet been definitively demonstrated in studies. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)What are the major thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19?COVID-19 is a hypercoagulable state associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), often pulmonary embolism (PE). The risk is highest in individuals in the intensive care unit (ICU), often despite prophylactic anticoagulation. The rate of arterial events is unclear, and the rate of VTE is lower in hospitalized medical patients. Bleeding is not common but has been seen, especially in the setting of trauma and/or anticoagulation. Thrombotic complications are treated with therapeutic dose anticoagulation. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'VTE'.)What are the major coagulation abnormalities in patients with COVID-19?A number of laboratory abnormalities have been reported, including high fibrinogen and D-dimer and mild prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Abnormal coagulation studies are mainly used to monitor clinical status and to help determine level of care. Very high D-dimer is associated with a high mortality rate. Atypical findings (eg, severe thrombocytopenia) should be further evaluated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Coagulation abnormalities'.)EVALUATIONWhen should patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 be advised to stay at home? Go to the hospital?Home management is appropriate for most patients with mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, and/or myalgias without dyspnea), provided they can be adequately isolated, monitored, and supported in the outpatient setting. However, there should be a low threshold to clinically evaluate patients who have any risk factor for more severe illness, even if they have only mild symptoms. Patients being managed at home should be educated about the potential for worsening disease and advised to closely monitor for symptoms of more serious disease, including dyspnea or persistent chest pain. The development of these symptoms should prompt clinical evaluation and possible hospitalization. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted'.)What are the different types of tests for COVID-19?There are two major types of tests for COVID-19: ●Nucleic acid amplifications tests (NAATs; eg, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) – RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 is the primary test used to diagnose active COVID-19. The test is typically performed on nasopharyngeal swabs, but can also be performed on other respiratory tract specimens (eg, oropharyngeal swabs, lower respiratory tract samples). There are several different RT-PCR assays available, and the sensitivity and specificity of each assay differ. ●Serology – Serologic tests measure antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are primarily used to identify patients who have had COVID-19 in the past. While some serologic assays can help identify patients with acute infection, they are not as reliable as RT-PCR and not recommended for this purpose. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)How accurate is RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2? Should two tests be performed or one?Tests for COVID-19 are new, and determining their accuracy is challenging. A positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, false-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been well documented. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, we suggest repeating the test. For hospitalized patients with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement, the repeat test can be performed on expectorated sputum or a tracheal aspirate, if available. In many cases, because of the limited availability of testing and concern for false-negative results, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made presumptively based on a compatible clinical presentation in the setting of an exposure risk (residence in or travel to an area with widespread community transmission or known contact). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)HOME CAREWhat advice should be given to patients with known or presumed COVID-19 managed at home?For most patients with COVID-19 who are managed at home, we advise the following: ●Supportive care with antipyretics/analgesics (eg, acetaminophen) and hydration ●Close contact with their health care provider ●Monitoring for clinical worsening, particularly the development of dyspnea, which should prompt clinical evaluation and possible hospitalization●Separation from other household members, including pets (eg, staying in a separate room when possible and wearing a mask when in the same room)●Frequent hand washing for all family members●Frequent disinfection of commonly touched surfaces(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Management and counseling for all outpatients'.)How long should patients cared for at home stay isolated?The optimal duration of home isolation is uncertain. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued recommendations on discontinuation of home isolation, which include both test-based and non-test-based strategies. The choice of strategy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, since each strategy has potential limitations. When a test-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue home isolation when there is:●Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications AND●Improvement in respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) AND●Negative results of a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) When a symptom-based strategy is used, patients may discontinue home isolation when the following criteria are met:●At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared AND●At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery of symptoms (defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms [eg, cough, shortness of breath])In some cases, patients may have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, but they did not have any symptoms when they were tested. In such patients, home isolation may be discontinued using a test-based strategy or a time-based strategy (when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 test) as long as there was no evidence of subsequent illness. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)MEDICATIONSWhat are the treatment options for patients with COVID-19? Do any have proven efficacy?All agents being used for the treatment of COVID-19 are investigational. Use of these agents is generally limited to hospitalized patients who have or are at risk for severe disease. When possible, treatment should be given as part of a clinical trial. Agents that appear more promising are listed here:●Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue. Emerging data suggest there is clinical benefit to its use, and we recommend remdesivir for hospitalized patients with severe disease. Although not widely available, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized emergency use, and several centers in the United States and elsewhere are performing randomized trials to further evaluate its efficacy. ●Convalescent plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 contains antibodies that could potentially hasten recovery in patients with active COVID-19. In the United States, the FDA is accepting emergency investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19.●Interleukin (IL)-6 pathway inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, are being evaluated for patients with severe disease and/or features consistent with cytokine release syndrome. Evidence of efficacy is anecdotal.●Hydroxychloroquine is an older, oral agent that has direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. We suggest not using hydroxychloroquine outside of a clinical trial because of the lack of clear benefit for its use and its potential toxicities.Other investigational agents include favipiravir, interferon beta, lopinavir-ritonavir, and combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin. Because all treatment options are investigational, monitoring for adverse effects is an important part of care. Registries of clinical trials can be found on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Should I use acetaminophen or NSAIDs when providing supportive care?Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been theorized to cause harm in patients with COVID-19, but there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk. Given the uncertainty, we use acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent for most patients rather than NSAIDs. If NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose. We do not routinely discontinue NSAIDs in patients using them for the management of chronic illnesses. The FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) do not recommend that NSAIDs be avoided when clinically indicated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Should glucocorticoids be used for treatment of COVID-19?No, we agree with recommendations by the WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that systemic glucocorticoids not be used in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications (eg, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)Do ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the likelihood of severe COVID-19?Patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents. The membrane-bound ACE2 functions as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and because ACE inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2, there is speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for severe disease. However, there is no evidence to support an association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with more severe disease, and it is also possible that these drugs may attenuate the severity of disease. In addition, stopping these agents in some patients can exacerbate comorbid cardiovascular or kidney disease and increase mortality. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'ACE inhibitors/ARBs' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)When should anticoagulation be used, and how much?All inpatients with COVID-19 (intensive care unit [ICU], medical, surgical, and obstetric) should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated (algorithm 1). Prophylactic dose low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is preferred, but prophylactic dose unfractionated heparin can be used if LMW heparin is unavailable or if kidney function is severely impaired. Some institutional protocols include more aggressive anticoagulation with intermediate dose or even therapeutic dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis, especially in the ICU, and some continue anticoagulation in selected patients following discharge. Data are lacking on the efficacy and safety of these approaches, and enrollment in a clinical trial is encouraged. Full (therapeutic)-dose anticoagulation is used for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Management'.)PREVENTION AND INFECTION CONTROLHave any medications been shown to prevent COVID-19?No agent is known to be effective for preventing COVID-19. While hydroxychloroquine is being studied as a prophylactic agent, its safety and efficacy have not been proven. We suggest that neither this medication nor any other be used for prophylaxis outside of clinical trials. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)What PPE is recommended for health care workers taking care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?Any personnel entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE): gown, gloves, eye protection (eyeglasses alone are insufficient), and a respirator (eg, an N95 respirator). If the supply of respirators is limited, facemasks are an acceptable alternative, except during aerosol-generating procedures (eg, tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, bronchoscopy, noninvasive ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Health care workers should be aware of the appropriate sequence of putting on (figure 1) and taking off (figure 2) PPE to avoid contamination.In addition, patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures should be placed in negative-pressure rooms. Most other patients can be placed in a single-occupancy, neutral-pressure room with the door closed. Patients with suspected or known COVID-19 should not be placed in positive-pressure rooms. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)IMMUNITYDoes protective immunity develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection? Can reinfection occur?Antibodies to the virus are induced in those who have become infected. Preliminary evidence suggests that some of these antibodies are protective, but this remains to be definitively established. Moreover, it is unknown whether all infected patients mount a protective immune response and how long any protective effect will last. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Immunity and risk of reinfection'.)SPECIAL POPULATIONSAsthma/COPDShould patients using inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma or COPD be advised to stop these medications to prevent COVID-19?No, patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who need inhaled glucocorticoids to maintain control of their asthma or COPD should continue them at their usual dose. When indicated, inhaled steroids help to minimize risk of an asthma or COPD exacerbation and the associated need for interaction with the health care system. There is no good evidence that inhaled glucocorticoids increase susceptibility to COVID-19 or have an adverse effect on the course of infection. Stopping them may worsen asthma or COPD control and thereby increase the risk for complications of COVID-19, if acquired. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Should patients with COVID-19 and an acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD be treated with systemic glucocorticoids?Yes, patients with COVID-19 infection and a concomitant acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD should receive prompt treatment with systemic glucocorticoids as indicated by usual guidelines. Delaying therapy can increase the risk of a life-threatening exacerbation. While the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend glucocorticoids not be routinely used in the treatment of COVID-19 infection, exacerbations of asthma and COPD are considered appropriate indications for use. Overall, the known benefits of systemic glucocorticoids for exacerbations of asthma and COPD outweigh the potential harm in COVID-19 infection. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeedingWhat special considerations are there for pregnant and breastfeeding women?Issues related to COVID-19 during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: Questions and answers"".)PediatricsWhat is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children?Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that has been reported in children from Europe, the United States, and Canada in association with current or recent COVID-19 infection or exposure. It shares clinical features with Kawasaki disease (KD), KD shock, and toxic shock syndrome. Clinical features include persistent fever, severe illness with involvement of multiple organ systems, and elevated inflammatory markers (table 1). Most children with MIS-C have survived, although many have required intensive care. Pending additional information, children with clinical features of MIS-C should be promptly referred to a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases, rheumatology, cardiology, and/or critical care, as necessary. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)BLOOD DONATIONWhat should I tell patients about donating blood or plasma during the pandemic?Blood donation is particularly important during the pandemic due to concerns that the supply could become critically low. Having a history of COVID-19 is not an exclusion to donation as long as the illness resolved at least 14 days prior to donation. Persons who have recovered from COVID-19 are encouraged to donate plasma, because convalescent plasma is an investigational treatment for COVID-19. Information on where to donate blood or plasma can be found at the American Red Cross and the AABB websites or by contacting community blood centers. (See ""Blood donor screening: Medical history"", section on 'COVID-19 pandemic revised deferral criteria' and ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)REFERENCESSupporting references can be found in the linked UpToDate topics.",2020-05-22 02:00:00,UPTODATE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
ID:127429,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.This topic will discuss the management of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. Our approach to hospital management is based on limited data and evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management, which may differ from our approach. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and, in the United States, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3] and the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel [4]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)The management of patients with COVID-19 in the home and outpatient setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Issues related to COVID-19 in specific populations are discussed elsewhere:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EVALUATION — Our objective in the evaluation of hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 is to evaluate for features associated with severe illness (table 1) and identify organ dysfunction or other comorbidities that could complicate potential therapy. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)Although we check several laboratory tests to evaluate patients with documented or suspected COVID-19, the prognostic value of many of them remains uncertain, and other institutions may not include all these tests. At least initially, we check the following laboratory studies daily:●Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, with a focus on the total lymphocyte count trend●Complete metabolic panel●Creatine kinase (CK)●C-reactive protein (CRP)●FerritinInitially, we check the following studies every other day (or daily if elevated or in the intensive care unit):●Prothrombin time (PT)/partial prothrombin time (PTT)/fibrinogen●D-dimerWe check the following studies at baseline and repeat them if abnormal or with clinical worsening:●Lactate dehydrogenase, repeated daily if elevated●Troponin, repeated every two to three days if elevated●Electrocardiogram (ECG), with at least one repeat test after starting any QTc-prolonging agent (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Monitoring for QT prolongation')We also check hepatitis B virus serologies, hepatitis C virus antibody, and HIV antigen/antibody testing if these have not been previously performed. Chronic viral hepatitis could affect interpretation of transaminase elevations and exacerbate hepatotoxicity of certain therapies; underlying HIV infection may change the assessment of the patient's risk for deterioration and would warrant initiation of antiretroviral therapy. We check a portable chest radiograph in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; for most patients, this is sufficient for initial evaluation of pulmonary complications and extent of lung involvement. Although chest computed tomography (CT) was frequently used in China for evaluation of patients with COVID-19, we reserve chest CT for circumstances that might change clinical management, in part to minimize infection control issues related to transport. This is consistent with recommendations from the American College of Radiology [5]. Although certain characteristic chest CT findings may be seen in COVID-19, they cannot reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other causes of viral pneumonia. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.)We do not routinely obtain echocardiograms on patients with COVID-19; developments that might warrant an echocardiogram include increasing troponin levels with hemodynamic compromise or other cardiovascular findings suggestive of cardiomyopathy. Acute myocardial injury has been a described complication of COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'When to suspect myocardial injury and key considerations'.) Secondary bacterial infection has not been a frequently reported feature of COVID-19; if this is suspected (eg, based on chest imaging or sudden deterioration), we check two sets of blood cultures and sputum Gram stain and culture. Procalcitonin can be checked to assess the risk of secondary bacterial infection; however, since elevated procalcitonin levels have been reported as COVID-19 progresses, they may be less specific for bacterial infection later in the disease course [6-9]. As above, the prognostic value of the results of some of the tests we use to evaluate patients with COVID-19 is uncertain, and the optimal use of these markers remains unknown. As an example, although some clinicians also note the potential utility of troponin levels to inform the risk of severe COVID-19 and provide a baseline for comparison in patients who develop manifestations of myocardial injury [10], others reserve troponin level testing for patients who have specific clinical suspicion for acute coronary syndrome [11]. One concern is that the results could lead to unnecessary use of medical resources (eg, serial troponins, electrocardiograms and cardiology consults for elevated troponin). If troponin is checked in a patient with COVID-19, clinicians should be aware that an elevated level does not necessarily indicate acute coronary syndrome. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"", section on 'Troponin'.) GENERAL MANAGEMENT ISSUESEmpiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia in select patients — For patients with documented COVID-19, we do not routinely administer empiric therapy for bacterial pneumonia. Data are limited, but bacterial superinfection does not appear to be a prominent feature of COVID-19. However, since the clinical features of COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from bacterial pneumonia, empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia is reasonable when the diagnosis is uncertain. Empiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia may also be reasonable in patients with documented COVID-19 if there is clinical suspicion for it (eg, new fever after defervescence with new consolidation on chest imaging). If empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated, we attempt to make a microbial diagnosis (eg, through sputum Gram stain and culture, urinary antigen testing) and reevaluate the need to continue antibiotic therapy daily. In such settings, a low procalcitonin may be helpful to suggest against a bacterial pneumonia; however, elevated procalcitonin has been described in COVID-19, particularly late in the course of illness, and does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection [6-9]. (See ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"", section on 'Guiding antibiotic therapy'.)The diagnosis of and empiric antibiotic regimens for community-acquired and health care-associated pneumonia are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Overview of community-acquired pneumonia in adults"" and ""Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"" and ""Treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"".)Prevention of and evaluation for venous thromboembolism — We favor pharmacologic prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19, consistent with recommendations from several expert societies [12-14]. Dosing and selection of pharmacologic agents to prevent venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere (algorithm 1). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis'.)Several studies suggest a high rate of thromboembolic complications among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly those who are critically ill. The thromboembolic risk with COVID-19 as well as the evaluation for and management of these complications are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'VTE' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Indications for full-dose anticoagulation'.)Uncertainty about NSAID use — There are minimal data informing the risks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the setting of COVID-19. We use acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose; this is consistent with the general approach to fever reduction in adults (see ""Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults"", section on 'Treating fever'). We do not discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions, unless there are other reasons to stop them (eg, renal injury, gastrointestinal bleeding). Concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young patients who received NSAIDs early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [15,16]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO, and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel do not recommend NSAIDs be avoided when clinically indicated [4,17,18]. Avoiding nebulized medications — Inhaled medications should be administered by metered dose inhaler, whenever possible, rather than through a nebulizer, to avoid the risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 through nebulization. If a nebulizer must be used, appropriate infection control precautions should be taken. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)'.)Limited role of glucocorticoids — We agree with recommendations by the WHO and CDC that systemic glucocorticoids not be used in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications (eg, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) [19,20].For those without pre-existing pulmonary disease, we also avoid inhaled glucocorticoids. The use of inhaled glucocorticoids in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the setting of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Acute exacerbations of asthma in adults: Emergency department and inpatient management"", section on 'Advice related to covid-19 pandemic' and ""Stable COPD: Overview of management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19'.)Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in management of SARS, there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm [21]. (See ""Treatment of seasonal influenza in adults"", section on 'Adjunctive therapies' and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Treatment and prevention"", section on 'Treatment'.)The approach to glucocorticoids among critically ill patients with COVID-19 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'.)Managing chronic medicationsACE inhibitors/ARBs — Patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents if there is no other reason for discontinuation (eg, hypotension, acute kidney injury). This approach is supported by multiple guidelines panels [22-26]. There has been speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes, but this has not been supported by findings from observational studies. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)Conversely, ARBs have also been proposed to have potential protective effects based on their mechanism of action [27], but there is no trial evidence to support this hypothesis. We do not use ACE inhibitors or ARBs as potential COVID-19 treatment.Statins — We make a point of continuing statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are already taking them. A high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 have underlying cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and other indications for use of statins. Moreover, acute cardiac injury is a reported complication of COVID-19. Although clinicians may be concerned about hepatotoxicity from statins, particularly since transaminase elevations are common in COVID-19, most evidence indicates that liver injury from statins is uncommon. (See ""Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration"", section on 'Hepatic dysfunction'.) Whether statins could impact the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clear. Statins are known inhibitors of the MYD88 pathway, which results in marked inflammation, and have been reported to stabilize MYD88 levels in the setting of external stress in vitro and in animal studies [28]. Dysregulation of MYD88 has been noted and associated with poor outcomes in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, but this has not been described with SARS-CoV-2. Although statins might be of benefit in patients with COVID-19, more data are needed.Immunomodulatory agents — Use of immunosuppressing agents has been associated with increased risk for severe disease with other respiratory viruses, and the decision to discontinue prednisone, biologics, or other immunosuppressive drugs in the setting of COVID-19 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"", section on 'Patients with COVID-19 symptoms or a known COVID-19 exposure' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Adjusting immunosuppression'.) For individuals with underlying conditions who require treatment with these agents and do not have suspected or documented COVID-19, there is no evidence that routinely discontinuing treatment is of any benefit. In addition, discontinuing these medications may result in loss of response when the agent is reintroduced. The approach of continuing immunomodulatory therapy in patients without infection is supported by statements from dermatology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology societies [29-32].Infection control — Infection control is an essential component of management of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.) COVID-19-SPECIFIC THERAPYSpecific treatments — Several treatments are being evaluated for COVID-19. Although some of these treatments are clinically available for other indications, their use for COVID-19 remains investigational.Remdesivir — Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro [33]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for hospitalized children and adults with severe COVID-19 (SpO2 ≤94 percent on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) [34]. The suggested adult dose is 200 mg intravenously on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for 10 days total in patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO and 5 days total in other patients (with extension to 10 days if there is no clinical improvement). Remdesivir is not recommended in patients with an alanine aminotransferase ≥5 times the upper limit of normal (and should be discontinued if it rises above this level during treatment or if there are other signs of liver injury). The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in the setting of renal impairment are uncertain, and it is prepared in a cyclodextrin vehicle that accumulates in renal impairment and may be toxic; thus, remdesivir is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Data from comparative, randomized trials are needed to define the effect of remdesivir in COVID-19; these data are emerging but remain limited and mixed. Overall, if preliminary results are confirmed, there is likely some clinical benefit to remdesivir, although the patient population most likely to benefit remains uncertain.The United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced preliminary results of a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir among 1063 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and evidence of lung involvement [35]. On interim analysis, remdesivir resulted in a faster time to recovery, defined as being discharged from the hospital or no longer requiring supplemental oxygen (median 11 versus 15 days with placebo, p<0.001). There was also a trend towards lower mortality that was not statistically significant (8 versus 11.6 percent with placebo, p = 0.059). Final analysis and peer review of these data are pending. In contrast, in a double-blind randomized trial in China of 237 patients with severe COVID-19 (hypoxia and radiographically confirmed pneumonia), time to clinical improvement was not statistically different with remdesivir compared with placebo for 10 days (median 21 versus 23 days; hazard ratio for improvement 1.23 [95% CI 0.87-1.75]) [36]. Clinical improvement was defined as discharge from the hospital or a two-point improvement on a six-point clinical score that ranges from death to mechanical ventilation to lower levels of oxygen support to discharge. This study only included one patient who was on mechanical ventilation at baseline. Mortality at 28 days was also similar with remdesivir or placebo (14 versus 13 percent); there was also no difference in time to viral clearance. Among patients who had received treatment within 10 days of symptom onset, there were trends towards lower mortality and more rapid clinical improvement with remdesivir, but these differences were not statistically significant. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events (including gastrointestinal symptoms, aminotransferase or bilirubin elevations, and worsened cardiopulmonary status) in 12 percent, compared with 5 percent in the placebo group. Several limitations reduce confidence in the finding of no effect; concomitant therapies (lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon alpha-2b, and/or corticosteroids) were used by most study participants, patients in the remdesivir group had a higher proportion of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease), and the study was stopped early for poor enrollment (the target enrollment pre-determined to demonstrate effect was 435 patients). Early data suggest that 5 days of remdesivir result in similar outcomes as 10. In a preliminary report from the manufacturer of a randomized, open-label trial among nearly 400 patients with severe COVID-19 who were not on mechanical ventilation, the rates of clinical recovery and discharge by day 14 were not statistically different when remdesivir was given for 5 days (65 and 60 percent, respectively) versus 10 days (54 and 52 percent, respectively) [37]. Mortality rates at day 14 were 8 and 11 percent with 5 and 10 days of treatment, respectively, and varied by geographic location.Use of remdesivir has also been described in several case series [38-40]. In one multicenter, multinational series, 53 patients with severe COVID-19 and hypoxia received compassionate-use remdesivir for up to 10 days and had a median of 18 days of follow-up; 68 percent had clinical improvement (decreased requirement for oxygen support or hospital discharge), and 13 percent died [40]. Of the 30 patients who were mechanically ventilated at baseline, 17 (57 percent) were extubated, and three of four patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were taken off it. Reported side effects include nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations. In a preliminary report from a trial of remdesivir among patients with severe COVID-19, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations occurred in 7 percent and led to drug discontinuation in 3 percent [37]. Other adverse events described in patients who received remdesivir include worsening kidney injury, multiple organ failure, and worsened cardiopulmonary status [36,40]. Convalescent plasma — In the United States, the FDA is accepting investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 [41]; pathways for use through these applications include clinical trials, expanded access programs, and emergency individual use. Use of convalescent plasma has been described in case series [42-44]. One case series described administration of plasma from donors who had completely recovered from COVID-19 to five patients with severe COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation and persistently high viral titers despite investigational antiviral treatment [42]. The patients had decreased nasopharyngeal viral load, decreased disease severity score, and improved oxygenation by 12 days after transfusion. However, these findings do not establish a causal effect, and the efficacy of convalescent plasma remains unknown. In another case series of six patients who received convalescent plasma late in the course of illness, five died despite SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance within three days of treatment [44]. Finding appropriate donors and establishing testing to confirm neutralizing activity of plasma may be logistical challenges. In the United States, the American Red Cross is helping to collect and distribute convalescent plasma throughout the country [45]. (See ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)The FDA is also facilitating the evaluation of hyperimmune globulin for patients with COVID-19 [45]. IL-6 pathway inhibitors — Markedly elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin) and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin [IL]-6) are associated with critical and fatal COVID-19, and blocking the inflammatory pathway has been hypothesized to prevent disease progression. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor inhibitor used for rheumatic diseases and cytokine release syndrome and is being evaluated in randomized trials for treatment of COVID-19. Case reports and observational studies have described use of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 [46-53]. As an example, in a study of 63 patients with severe COVID-19 who had laboratory results suggesting a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, no major adverse events were thought to be directly related to tocilizumab (given intravenously or subcutaneously), which was associated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin levels; overall, there was a 14-day mortality rate of 11 percent [51].Sarilumab and siltuximab are other agents that target the IL-6 pathway and are also being evaluated in clinical trials. Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine — There are insufficient data thus far to know whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has a role in treatment of COVID-19. For this reason, we strongly recommend that patients should be referred to a clinical trial whenever possible. In the United States, the FDA has issued an emergency use authorization to allow the use of these agents in adolescents or adults hospitalized for COVID-19 when participation in clinical trials is not feasible [54]. When a clinical trial is not available, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity. If drugs are used for COVID-19 outside a clinical trial, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) encourages creation of a registry, when possible, to systematically evaluate their safety and efficacy [55]. Additionally, if hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is used outside of a clinical trial, the potential for adverse effects should be carefully assessed. In particular, these agents can prolong the QT interval and should be avoided in patients with prolonged baseline QTc interval or on other agents that affect cardiac conduction, and otherwise should be used with close monitoring. The American College of Cardiology has suggested QTc monitoring parameters in this setting [56]. QTc monitoring in this setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Monitoring for QT prolongation'.)Other risks (eg, retinopathy or cardiomyopathy) are primarily with longer-term use and higher cumulative doses, but should be a consideration when deciding to use these agents. Catastrophic outcomes have been reported with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine overdose; no individual should use these medications without medical supervision [57,58]. (See ""Antimalarial drugs in the treatment of rheumatic disease"", section on 'Adverse effects'.)Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, although hydroxychloroquine appears to have more potent antiviral activity [59]. Randomized trials evaluating their clinical use are underway. However, published clinical data on either of these agents are limited, have methodologic problems, and do not suggest a clear benefit [60-65]. In an open-label randomized trial of 150 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (either no pneumonia or pneumonia without hypoxia), adding hydroxychloroquine to standard of care did not improve the rate of SARS-CoV-2 clearance (84 versus 81 percent with standard of care alone) or result in symptomatic improvement (60 versus 66 percent) by 28 days [64]. Methodologic concerns with this trial include concomitant co-therapies, baseline differences between the groups, and lack of blinding or placebo control. Available evidence does not suggest a benefit for patients with severe COVID-19, although data in this population are limited to observational studies. In an observational study of nearly 1400 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in New York, hydroxychloroquine use was reported in 811 patients and was associated with a higher risk of intubation or death (hazard ratio [HR] 2.37) [62]. Patients who received hydroxychloroquine were older, were more likely to have comorbidities, and had more severe illness than those who did not, which were likely confounding variables; in a multivariate analysis comparing those patients with a propensity score-matched subset of 274 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine, there was no association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (adjusted HR 1.04). In another observational study from France of 180 patients with severe COVID-19 who required oxygen supplementation but not critical care, the rates of transfer to the intensive care unit or death were similar among those who did and did not receive hydroxychloroquine [65].Studies have, however, highlighted the potential for toxicity of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. One trial comparing two doses of chloroquine for COVID-19 was stopped early because of a higher mortality rate in the high-dose group [66]. In an observational study in which 84 patients received hydroxychloroquine, 10 percent had electrocardiographic changes that prompted discontinuation [65]. QTc prolongation with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)'.)The evidence on the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Others' below.)Others — Many other agents with known or putative antiviral or immunomodulating effects have been proposed for use in patients with COVID-19 [67-71], and some are in preclinical or clinical evaluation. Use of these agents for COVID-19 should be limited to clinical trials; their efficacy has not been proven, and extensive off-label use may result in excess toxicity and critical shortages of drugs for proven indications. A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org, as well as on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. ●Favipiravir – Favipiravir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor that is available in some Asian countries for treatment of influenza, and it is being evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 in the United States. In a study of patients with non-severe disease (including oxygen saturation >93 percent), use of favipiravir was associated with faster rates of viral clearance (median time to clearance 4 versus 11 days) and more frequent radiographic improvement (in 91 versus 62 percent by day 14) compared with lopinavir-ritonavir [72]. However, other therapies were administered in this non-randomized, open-label study, so the results should be interpreted with caution given potential confounders.●Interferon beta – Interest in interferon beta for SARS-CoV-2 was spurred by evidence suggesting in vitro activity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and good outcomes in an animal model of MERS-CoV infection [73-75]. In one open-label randomized trial from Hong Kong, 127 adults hospitalized with primarily nonsevere COVID-19 were randomly assigned 2:1 to a combination intervention (interferon beta, ribavirin, plus lopinavir-ritonavir if symptom onset was within 7 days or ribavirin plus lopinavir-ritonavir if symptom onset was between 7 to 14 days) versus control (lopinavir-ritonavir alone) [76]. Patients in the intervention group had more rapid times to a negative SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal swab (median 7 versus 12 days), clinical improvement (median 4 versus 8 days), and hospital discharge (median 9 versus 15 days); in a subgroup analysis, the differences were only observed among patients with symptom onset within 7 days who thus received interferon beta as part of the intervention. Adverse effects were similar between the intervention and control groups. No hemolysis was detected with ribavirin (400 mg orally twice daily). Further study is needed to clarify the role of interferon beta in COVID-19 therapy.●Other immunomodulatory agents – Because of the observation that some patients have a clinical presentation that resembles cytokine release syndrome and the association between severe disease and a number of pro-inflammatory markers, interrupting the inflammatory cascade has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for severe COVID-19. In addition to IL-6 pathway inhibitors (see 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors' above), immunomodulatory agents from various classes, including IL-1 inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and complement inhibitors, are being evaluated. Their use has been described in case series and other observational studies [68,77-80]. As an example, in a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring non-invasive ventilation, and markedly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) or ferritin, receipt of high-dose anakinra in 29 patients (in addition to hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir) was associated with a lower 21-day mortality rate compared with a historical cohort of 16 patients who received only hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir (10 versus 44 percent); however, the historical group was older, and the likelihood of other, unmeasured confounders makes the findings difficult to interpret [77]. Results of randomized trials are necessary to determine the effect of these agents. ●Azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine – We do not use azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19. Use of the combination has been described in observational studies [60,63,81,82]. Although one study suggested the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine was associated with more rapid resolution of virus detection than hydroxychloroquine alone [60], this result should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size, substantial methodologic concerns [83], and unclear biologic plausibility. Another small observational study in patients with more severe illness did not suggest rapid viral RNA clearance with the combination [81]. Furthermore, both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine are associated with QTc prolongation, and combined use may potentiate this adverse effect. In a large observational study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, the adjusted mortality rate among those who received azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine was similar compared with those who received neither agent, but the rate of cardiac arrest was higher [63].●Lopinavir-ritonavir – This combined protease inhibitor, which has primarily been used for HIV infection, has in vitro activity against the SARS-CoV [84] and appears to have some activity against MERS-CoV in animal studies [73]. However, lopinavir-ritonavir appears to have minimal to no role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of a clinical trial. The WHO has launched a multinational trial to further evaluate remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir with and without interferon beta [85]. Results from a randomized trial do not demonstrate a clear benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir. In a randomized trial of 199 patients with severe COVID-19, the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir (400/100 mg) twice daily for 14 days to standard care did not decrease the time to clinical improvement compared with standard care alone [86]. There was a trend towards decreased mortality with lopinavir-ritonavir (19 versus 25 percent), and the numerical difference in mortality was greater among those who were randomized within 12 days of symptom onset, but neither difference was statistically significant. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 decline was similar in the group that received lopinavir-ritonavir and the group that did not. Lopinavir-ritonavir was stopped early in 14 percent because of adverse effects. If lopinavir-ritonavir is used, the patient's HIV status should be known. If the patient has HIV, lopinavir-ritonavir should be used as a standard combination antiretroviral regimen. Approach — The optimal approach to treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Although some trial data suggest a benefit with remdesivir, these data are very preliminary and have not been formally peer reviewed or reported, and there are otherwise no therapies that have clearly proven effective; for most potential therapies, evidence for their use comes primarily from observational case series and anecdotal use based on in vitro or extrapolated indirect evidence.Thus, when available, we strongly recommend enrollment into a well-controlled clinical trial. Our approach is consistent with recommendations from expert groups in the United States. The IDSA recommends that COVID-19-specific therapy be given in the context of a clinical trial and additionally recommends certain therapies (including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and tocilizumab) only be administered in the context of a clinical trial because of a greater level of uncertainty or potential for toxicity [55]. Similarly, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel notes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any antiviral or immune-based therapy and specifically recommends against using certain therapies (including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, interferons, and Janus kinase inhibitors) outside the context of a clinical trial [4].A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org, as well as on the WHO website and at clinicaltrials.gov. We use a risk-based approach to try to enroll those patients who may be most likely to benefit. The approach is dependent on local availability of clinical trials and may not be universally applicable. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management.Defining disease severity — Mild disease is characterized by fever, malaise, cough, upper respiratory symptoms, and/or less common features of COVID-19, in the absence of dyspnea. Most of these patients do not need hospitalization. If patients develop dyspnea, that raises concern that they have at least moderate severity disease, and these patients often warrant hospitalization. Patients can have infiltrates on chest imaging and still be considered to have moderate disease, but the presence of any of the following features indicates severe disease: ●Hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤93 percent on room air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg)●Tachypnea (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute) or respiratory distress●More than 50 percent involvement of the lung parenchyma on chest imagingThese features were used in China to characterize severe disease in a large cohort of patients [87] and are consistent with the United States NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel definition of severe infection [4]. We also treat patients who have certain laboratory abnormalities (table 1) similar to patients who have severe disease, because these abnormalities have been associated with disease progression in several studies.Nonsevere disease — For most patients with nonsevere disease, we suggest supportive care only, with close monitoring for clinical worsening. If they develop features of severe disease (eg, hypoxia, tachypnea, or respiratory distress (see 'Defining disease severity' above)), or if they have any laboratory features associated with disease progression (table 1), we treat them as described below. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' below.)Some clinical trials may be available for patients with nonsevere disease. If so, we prioritize patients who have epidemiologic risk factors associated with development of severe illness (table 2). We generally do not treat patients with nonsevere disease with experimental agents outside the context of a clinical trial.Severe (including critical) disease — We prioritize COVID-19-specific therapy for hospitalized patients who have severe disease or laboratory risk factors for disease progression (table 1). For hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, we recommend remdesivir, if available. In the United States, remdesivir can be obtained through the FDA's emergency use authorization, although availability is limited to hospitals designated for distribution by the federal government [88]. For pregnant individuals, remdesivir may also be obtained through a compassionate use program. (See 'Remdesivir' above.)For patients with severe disease or laboratory risk factors for disease progression (table 1) who cannot get remdesivir through these routes, we recommend referral to a clinical trial for treatment. We also refer patients who are able to get remdesivir through emergency use authorization to clinical trials for other agents, if they allow concurrent use of remdesivir. In addition to remdesivir, therapies being evaluated in trials include convalescent plasma and hydroxychloroquine. Patients who have features similar to cytokine release syndrome (eg, persistent fevers with elevated cytokine levels, ferritin, D-dimer, and/or other inflammatory markers) may also be eligible for clinical trials of IL-6 pathway inhibitors or other immunomodulators. A registry of international clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org. Detailed discussion of these agents is found elsewhere. (See 'Specific treatments' above.) If neither a clinical trial nor emergency-use remdesivir is an option, clinicians may be able to obtain convalescent plasma for investigational treatment of COVID-19; in the United States, this may be accessed through the FDA's investigational new drug application or expanded access program [41]. (See 'Convalescent plasma' above.)Although treatment is hypothesized to have greater impact when given early in the course of disease, the optimal timing for implementation of any of these therapies remains unknown. Until more data are available, it is uncertain which patients would benefit the most and how to best allocate potentially limited clinical trial slots or emergency use agents.Several agents being investigated for treatment of COVID-19 are available for other medical indications, and repurposed use for COVID-19 has been described. There are insufficient data to know whether these agents have any role in treatment of COVID-19; thus, we strongly recommend that patients be referred to a clinical trial whenever possible.When a clinical trial is not an option and remdesivir or convalescent plasma cannot be obtained, we favor supportive care rather than off-label use of available agents with unknown efficacy for COVID-19. In particular, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine outside of a clinical trial; limited available data do not suggest a clear benefit and do suggest the potential for toxicity. However, we acknowledge that, in the absence of other options, some clinicians may choose to use certain agents (eg, hydroxychloroquine, or IL-6 pathway inhibitors in patients with evidence of a severe pro-inflammatory state) for severely ill patients. If drugs are used for COVID-19 outside a clinical trial, the IDSA encourages creation of a registry to systematically evaluate their safety and efficacy [55]. MANAGEMENT OF HYPOXIA, ARDS, AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS — Patients with severe disease often need oxygenation support. High-flow oxygen and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation have been used, but the safety of these measures is uncertain, and they should be considered aerosol-generating procedures that warrant specific isolation precautions. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Respiratory care of the nonintubated patient'.) Some patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and warrant intubation with mechanical ventilation. Management of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and other critical care issues are discussed in detail elsewhere (table 3). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".) In addition to ARDS, other complications of infection include arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, thromboembolic events, and shock. Management of these complications is discussed elsewhere. ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Acute kidney injury'.)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)DISCHARGE — The decision to discharge a patient with COVID-19 is generally the same as that for other conditions and depends on the need for hospital-level care and monitoring. Continued need for infection control precautions should not prevent discharge home if the patient can appropriately self-isolate there; long-term care facilities may have specific requirements prior to accepting patients with COVID-19. Criteria for discontinuing precautions and infection control issues in long-term care facilities are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Long-term care facilities'.)Patients with COVID-19 generally warrant outpatient follow-up through telehealth or an in-person visit following discharge from the hospital. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"", section on 'Outpatient management following inpatient or ED discharge'.)We encourage patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to consider donating convalescent plasma. Interested patients can be referred to their community blood center or, in the United States, to the American Red Cross to determine whether they meet eligibility criteria for donation. (See ""Clinical use of plasma components"", section on 'COVID-19 pandemic'.) INSTITUTIONAL PROTOCOLS — Several academic medical institutions in the United States have developed COVID-19 management protocols that are publicly available. Given the paucity of high-quality clinical evidence on the management of COVID-19, the safety and efficacy of these strategies are uncertain: ●Brigham and Women's Hospital●Massachusetts General Hospital●Michigan Medicine●Nebraska Medicine●Penn Medicine●University of Washington MedicinePartners in Health has also released resources for clinicians and organizations in resource-limited settings. SPECIAL SITUATIONSPregnant and breastfeeding women — The management of pregnant and breastfeeding women with COVID-19 is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Pregnant and breastfeeding women'.)People with HIV — Data on the impact of HIV infection on the natural history of COVID-19 are limited [89,90]. However, many of the comorbid conditions associated with severe COVID-19 (eg, cardiovascular disease) occur frequently among patients with HIV, and these, in addition to CD4 cell count, should be considered in risk stratification. Additionally, drug interactions with antiretroviral agents are important to assess before starting any new therapies. Otherwise, the management of COVID-19 in patients with HIV is the same as in patients without HIV; HIV should not be a reason to exclude a patient from clinical trials or other interventions [91]. Lopinavir-ritonavir is being used in trials for patients with COVID-19, although data from one randomized trial do not suggest a benefit [86]. If a patient with HIV is not on a protease inhibitor-containing regimen, it should not be changed to include a protease inhibitor outside the context of a clinical trial and without consultation with an expert in the management of HIV [92].SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019; it has subsequently spread rapidly, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The optimal approach to treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Our approach is based on limited data and evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Many patients with known or suspected COVID-19 have mild disease that does not warrant hospital-level care. Having such patients recover at home is preferred, as it prevents additional potential exposures in the health care setting and reduces burden on the health care system. Identification of patients who can be managed in the outpatient setting is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●The evaluation of hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 should assess for features associated with severe illness and identify organ dysfunction or other comorbidities that could complicate potential therapy (table 2). (See 'Evaluation' above.)●Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (algorithm 1). COVID-19 has been associated with thromboembolic complications. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●There are minimal data informing the risks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the setting of COVID-19. We suggest acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, if possible (Grade 2C). If NSAIDs are needed, we use the lowest effective dose. We do not discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions if there are no other reasons to stop them. (See 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' above.)●Specific concern for COVID-19 should not impact the decision to start or stop angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). People who are on an ACE inhibitor or ARB for another indication should not stop their medication. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors'.)●We make a point of continuing statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are already taking them. (See 'Statins' above.)●The optimal use of COVID-19-specific therapy is uncertain; very preliminary, unpublished trial data suggest a benefit of remdesivir, but no other agent has clearly proven effective. For most potential therapies, evidence on their use is low quality. For this reason, patients should be referred to clinical trials whenever possible. Clinicians should consult their own local protocols for management. (See 'Approach' above.)•For patients with nonsevere disease who have no laboratory features associated with severe disease (table 1), care is primarily supportive, with close monitoring for disease progression. If a clinical trial is available for such patients, we prioritize those with advanced age (eg, >65 years) and other comorbidities associated with risk of progressive disease (table 2). (See 'Defining disease severity' above and 'Nonsevere disease' above.)•For hospitalized patients with severe disease, we recommend remdesivir, if available (Grade 1C). In the United States, remdesivir may be available through a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization. (See 'Remdesivir' above.)•For hospitalized patients with severe disease or with laboratory features associated with severe disease (table 1) who cannot get remdesivir through emergency use authorization, we recommend referral to a clinical trial (Grade 1C). Clinical trials of remdesivir are ongoing; other investigational therapies include convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 pathway inhibitors, and other immunomodulatory agents. We also refer patients who are able to get remdesivir through emergency use authorization to clinical trials for other agents, if they allow concurrent use of remdesivir. (See 'Severe (including critical) disease' above.)If neither a clinical trial nor remdesivir through emergency use authorization is available, clinicians may be able to obtain convalescent plasma for investigational use in patients with severe disease; in the United States, this can be requested through the FDA's expanded access program. (See 'Convalescent plasma' above.)When none of these options is available, we favor supportive care. In particular, we suggest not routinely using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine outside the context of a clinical trial given the lack of clear benefit from limited data and potential for toxicity (Grade 2C). We also suggest not using lopinavir-ritonavir for COVID-19 therapy outside of a clinical trial (Grade 2B). (See 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' above and 'Others' above.)●Patients with severe disease often need oxygenation support. Some patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and warrant intubation with mechanical ventilation. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●Infection control is an essential component of management of patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. This is discussed in detail elsewhere.

ID:127419,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues,"INTRODUCTION — A novel coronavirus was identified in late 2019 as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It has since rapidly spread resulting in a pandemic. The World Health Organization designated the disease term COVID-19 (ie, Coronavirus Disease 2019) [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The major morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 is largely due to acute viral pneumonitis that evolves to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of patients who become critically ill due to COVID-19. Other aspects of COVID-19, and other coronavirus-related diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)GUIDELINES AND HOSPITAL POLICIES — The advice in this topic is based upon data derived from the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, emerging retrospective data in patients with COVID-19, expert opinion, and anecdotal observations of clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 in China, Italy, and Washington state (USA), where the large outbreaks have occurred. Guidelines have been issued by several societies and organizations including the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the Chinese Thoracic Society, the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS), the World Health Organization and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health [2-8]. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)Learning from regions that have dealt with the overwhelming burden of COVID-19 to date, it is essential that all hospitals and health systems develop task forces to manage patients admitted with this disorder. This involves, but is not limited to, designating COVID-19-specific intensive care units (ICUs) and ICU teams, creating back up and expanded staffing schedules, utilizing detailed protocols for infection prevention and medical management, accessing research trials for patients with COVID-19, ensuring adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies and training, forecasting demand, and prioritizing diagnostic lab testing.EPIDEMIOLOGY — Reports suggest that among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), up to 20 percent develop severe disease requiring hospitalization [9-17]. Although rates vary, among those who are hospitalized, up to one-quarter need intensive care unit (ICU) admission, representing approximately 5 to 8 percent of the total infected population. Differences in the rates of ICU admission may relate to cultural differences in practice and admission criteria for ICU as well as differences in predisposing factors such as age and comorbidities and testing availability in the populations served.  ●China – In the Chinese cohorts, rates of ICU admission or severe illness ranged from 7 to 26 percent [10,11,16,18]. ●Italy - Consistent with the range reported in China, preliminary reports from Italy suggest that the proportion of ICU admissions were between 5 and 12 percent of the total positive SARS-CoV-2 cases, and 16 percent of all hospitalized patients [19,20]. ●United States of America – Among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, 1151 (20 percent) required mechanical ventilation [17]. In an early study of 21 critically ill patients in Washington State, USA, 81 percent of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the ICU and 71 percent were mechanically ventilated [21]. However, this high rate likely reflects the older age of the population which largely came from a nursing home in the region. A larger analysis of 2449 patients reported hospitalization rates of 20 to 31 percent and ICU admission rates of 4.9 to 11.5 percent [22].While three-quarters of critically ill patients were male in the Chinese cohorts, data from other areas are mixed with some reports suggesting an equal proportion of men and women [20,21] and other suggesting a male predominance [23,24]. CLINICAL FEATURES IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTSClinical features and complications — General clinical features of COVID-19 patients and risk factors for progression are discussed separately (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'). Discussion here is limited to clinical features in those who are critically ill.●Rate of progression – Retrospective studies of critically ill patients have suggested that among patients who develop critical illness, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), onset of dyspnea is relatively late (median 6.5 days after symptom onset), but progression to ARDS can be swift thereafter (median 2.5 days after onset of dyspnea) [10,11,21,25,26]. ●Clinical features – Among those who are critically ill, profound acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS is the dominant finding [9-11,21,23,24,26-30]. Hypercapnia is rare. Fevers tend to wax and wane during ICU admission. The need for mechanical ventilation in those who are critically ill is high ranging from 30 to 100 percent [10,21,23,24,27,30]. ●Length of stay – Early clinical reports suggest that length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay appears to be long with many patients remaining intubated for one to two weeks or longer [24]. Reports from experts in the field suggest that many patients fail early attempts at weaning (eg, within the first week), although this does not appear to predict their eventual ability to wean and extubate. Only a small proportion of patients require tracheostomy. (See 'Extubation and weaning' below and 'Tracheostomy' below.)●Complications – Common complications of COVID-19-related ARDS include acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated liver enzymes, and cardiac injury including cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. As an example, in a single-center retrospective cohort from China of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, complications included AKI (29 percent; half of whom needed renal replacement therapy), liver dysfunction (29 percent), and cardiac injury (23 percent) [10]. •Cardiac injury appears to be a late complication, developing after the respiratory illness improves. A high rate of cardiomyopathy was noted in a United States cohort (33 percent), and may relate to the older age in that population [21]. In another United States cohort in New York City, cardiac complications among mechanically ventilated patients included atrial arrhythmias (18 percent), myocardial infarction (8 percent), and heart failure (2 percent) [29]. One case series reported five patients who developed acute cor pulmonale, most of which occurred in association with hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest [31]. All cases were thought to be most likely due to pulmonary embolism (PE), although a definitive diagnosis of PE was confirmed in only one case. Cardiac complications of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)•Sepsis, shock, and multi-organ failure do occur but appear to be less common when compared with non-COVID-19-related ARDS. The need for vasoactive agents is variable, although a significant proportion need vasopressor support for hypotension (often due to sedation medications or cardiac dysfunction). In the cohort study from Wuhan, China, 35 percent of 52 patients received vasoactive agents [10]. In contrast, in the case series from New York City, 95 percent of the 130 patients who received mechanical ventilation required vasopressor support; the reasons for this were not specified [29]. •As above, acute kidney injury is common among critically ill patients with COVID-19, and many require renal replacement therapy. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Acute kidney injury'.)•Data on the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia are limited, but it does not appear to be a major feature of COVID-19. In a cohort of intubated patients from China, hospital-acquired pneumonia, in many cases with resistant pathogens, was reported in 12 percent [10]. This finding may be related to the high use of glucocorticoids for ARDS management in China. Further data are needed to elucidate the rate of superinfection in other countries.  •Lung compliance is high compared with other etiologies of ARDS and the rate of barotrauma appears to be low with only 2 percent developing pneumothorax, compared with 25 percent of those with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [10,32]. There are limited data describing the lung pathology in patients with COVID-19. Case reports from post mortem cases and patients undergoing biopsy for another reason suggest a wide variation from mononuclear inflammation to diffuse alveolar damage, classic of ARDS [33,34]. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and etiology in adults"", section on 'Pathologic stages'.)•Neurologic complications in critically ill patients are common, especially delirium or encephalopathy which manifests with prominent agitation and confusion along with corticospinal tract signs (hyperreflexia). Consistent with this, intensivists have observed that sedation requirements are high in this population, particularly immediately after intubation. In one series of 58 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, delirium/encephalopathy was present in approximately two-thirds of patients [35]. In addition, three of 13 patients who had brain MRI had an acute ischemic stroke; eight MRI studies demonstrated leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in seven patients was acellular and only one had elevated CSF protein; PCR assays of CSF were negative for the virus. It is unclear whether the neurologic complications noted in this and other reports are due to critical illness, medication effects, or represent more direct effects of cytokines or the SARS-CoV-2 virus [35-37]. Encephalitis, while reported, is rare [38]. Similarly, Guillain-Barré-barre syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has also been described in a small case series [39]. •COVID-coagulopathy is common in this population with some patients developing abnormal coagulation profiles and others developing thrombosis. These features are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●Laboratory – Laboratory findings in critically ill patients (eg leukopenia, lymphopenia, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, normal or low procalcitonin) are initially modest and similar to those with milder illness, although the procalcitonin level may be more elevated and lymphopenia more profound in critically ill patients [9,11,28]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings' and ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"" and ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.)Some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response, similar to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin, interleukin-6), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines; these laboratory abnormalities have been associated with poor prognosis [40]. Clinical trials of anti-IL-6 agents for the treatment of COVID-19 are in progress. Further details regarding CRS are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings' and ""Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)"" and ""Procalcitonin use in lower respiratory tract infections"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'IL-6 pathway inhibitors'.) The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies has also been described; however, they are mostly of the IgA subclass, and the clinical significance is unclear [41]. Abnormal coagulation parameters which are commonly seen in COVID-19 patients (eg, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time) are also discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"" and ""Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome"".)●Imaging – Typical imaging findings do not appear to be different in mild or severe cases of COVID-19 (eg, ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia, minimal or no pleural effusions) [10,42,43]. While imaging with chest computed tomography (CT) was commonly performed in Chinese cohorts, we prefer to avoid its use, unless necessary; if chest CT is used as a diagnostic tool, its use must be balanced with the risk to other patients and healthcare workers during the process of patient transport and time spent in the CT room. Characteristic findings on bedside lung ultrasound include thickening of the pleural line and B lines supporting alveolar consolidation. Pleural effusions are unusual [44]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.) Pathology — There are a paucity of data describing lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia in critically ill patients. Most autopsy reports describe hyaline membrane changes and microvessel thrombosis suggestive of early ARDS (ie, exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage [DAD]) [34,45-51]. Other findings include bacterial pneumonia (isolated or superimposed on DAD) and viral pneumonitis [46,50]. Less common findings include acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia (AFOP; in the late stages) [52], amyloid deposition (heart and lung), and rarely alveolar hemorrhage and vasculitis [50]. (See ""Interpretation of lung biopsy results in interstitial lung disease"", section on 'Diffuse alveolar damage'.)Evidence of pulmonary thrombosis and thromboembolism has been reported in autopsy series [46,50,51,53]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Clinical features'.)Distant organ involvement has also been seen with the demonstration of virus in organs other than the lung and, in some cases, acute tubular necrosis and a generalized thrombotic microangiopathy in the kidney [46,50]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)Risk factors for progression — Age appears to be the major risk factor that predicts progression to ARDS [13,21,22,27]. Comorbidities, high fever (≥39°C), history of smoking, and select laboratory features also predict progression and death from COVID-19. Importantly, adults of any age may develop severe disease and experience adverse outcomes, especially those with comorbidities. Further details regarding the risk of disease progression are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)RESPIRATORY CARE OF THE NONINTUBATED PATIENT — Specific aspects of respiratory care relevant to deteriorating patients with COVID-19 before admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) are discussed here (table 1). These include oxygenation with low flow and high-flow systems, noninvasive ventilation and the administration of nebulized medications. For hospitalized patients who develop progressive symptoms, early admission to the ICU is prudent when feasible. Self-proning — Some experts are encouraging that the hospitalized patient spend as much time as is feasible and safe in the prone position while receiving oxygen; the rationale for this approach is based upon limited direct evidence [54,55] and anecdotal observations in the field as well as indirect evidence of its efficacy in ventilated patients. (See 'Prone ventilation' below and 'Monitoring on noninvasive modalities' below.)Oxygenation targets — The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests titrating oxygen to a target peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of ≥90 percent. For most critically ill patients, we prefer the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting a SpO2 between 90 and 96 percent, if feasible. However, some patients may warrant a lower target (eg, patients with a concomitant acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) and others may warrant a higher target (eg, pregnancy). (See ""Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Fraction of inspired oxygen'.) Low flow oxygen — For patients with COVID-19, supplemental oxygenation with a low flow system via nasal cannula or oxygen pendant (picture 1) is appropriate (ie, up to 6 L/min). Although the degree of micro-organism aerosolization at low flow rates is unknown, it is reasonable to surmise that it is minimal. Higher flows of oxygen may be administered using a simple face mask, venturi face mask, or nonrebreather mask (eg, up to 10 to 20 L/minute), but as flow increases, the risk of dispersion also increases, augmenting the contamination of the surrounding environment and staff. Many experts have patients who wear nasal cannula also wear a droplet mask, especially during transport or when staff are in the room. Data to support this practice are largely non-peer-reviewed or derived from simulation experiments but make practical sense as a maneuver to reduce the infectious risk associated with potential aerosolization [56-58]. Additional information on the provision of low flow oxygen is provided separately. (See ""Continuous oxygen delivery systems for the acute care of infants, children, and adults"".)Patients with higher oxygen requirements — As patients progress, higher amounts of oxygen are needed. Options at this point in non-COVID-19 patients are high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) or the initiation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). However, in patients with COVID-19, this decision is controversial and subject to ongoing debate [59,60]. Despite this controversy, both modalities have been used variably. In retrospective cohorts, rates for HFNC use ranged from 14 to 63 percent while 11 to 56 percent were treated with NIV [10,24,27,30]. While, there are no prospective data describing whether these modalities were successful at avoiding intubation, one retrospective study described the highest level of respiratory support in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was noninvasive modalities (HFNC and NIV) in 5.4 percent of patients and invasive ventilation in 30 percent [30].   Deciding on a modality (noninvasive or invasive ventilation) — We believe that the decision to initiate noninvasive modalities, HFNC or NIV, should be made by balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of resources; this approach should be reassessed as new data become available. We encourage the development of hospital protocols and a multidisciplinary approach, which includes respiratory therapy staff, to facilitate this decision. In patients with COVID-19 who have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and higher oxygen needs than low flow oxygen can provide, we suggest that noninvasive modalities, may be used selectively rather than proceeding directly to intubation (eg, a younger patient without comorbidities who can tolerate nasal cannulae). On the other hand, some patients may warrant avoidance of HFNC and may benefit from proceeding directly to early intubation (eg, elderly or confused patient with comorbidities and several risk factors for progression). Some experts advocate the avoidance of both modalities (ie, proceeding to early intubation if escalating beyond 6 L/min with continued hypoxemia or increased work of breathing). This is predicated on an increased risk of aerosolization and high likelihood that patients who need these modalities will ultimately, rapidly deteriorate and require mechanical ventilation (eg, within one to three days). This approach may be reasonable when resources are available. However, using this as an absolute rule may result in an excess of unnecessary intubations and place an undue load on ventilator demand as the disease surges. In addition, this is particularly problematic for patients under investigation (eg, COVID-19 testing pending), patients who have chronic nocturnal NIV requirements, patients with chronic respiratory failure who have high baseline oxygen requirements, and patients with do-not-intubate status but who might benefit otherwise from NIV or HFNC. Ultimately, these recommendations may change with time depending on the case load of COVID-19 patients in a given location.   Oxygen via high flow nasal cannula versus noninvasive ventilation — Among the noninvasive modalities, we prefer HFNC. Our preference for HFNC is based upon limited and inconsistent data, which, on balance, favor HFNC compared with NIV in patients with non-COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the details of which are provided separately (see ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure'). In addition, limited data suggest a high failure rate of NIV in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [61] and other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (see ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure NOT due to ACPE'). However, NIV may be appropriate in patients with indications that have proven efficacy; these include patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and patients with sleep disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation). These data are provided separately. (See ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'.)  Monitoring on noninvasive modalities — If HFNC or NIV is administered, vigilant monitoring of patients is warranted for progression with frequent clinical and arterial blood gas evaluation every one to two hours to ensure efficacy and safe ventilation (eg, frequent coughing may not be “safe”). We advocate a low threshold to intubate such patients, particularly if they show any signs of rapid progression. (See 'Timing' below.)Although unproven, some experts, including us, provide HFNC (or NIV) while the patient is in the prone position. Limited evidence from case reports in non-COVID patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and anecdotal evidence suggest feasibility and improvement in oxygenation in some patients [54,62,63]. Similarly, preliminary evidence supports improvements in oxygenation parameters in patients with COVID-19 receiving NIV or HFNC [64,65]. For example, in a retrospective study, 12 out of 15 COVID-19 patients treated with NIV and pronation (median total of two cycles, three hours) experienced an improvement in the peripheral oxygen saturation while the remainder either stabilized or deteriorated [64]. In another prospective study of 24 COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, a third of whom were on oxygen flow of four liters or more (including HFNC), 15 patients (63 percent) could tolerate prone positioning for more than three hours [65]. Among those who tolerated prone positioning, six (40 percent) experienced improvements in oxygenation during prone positioning but in three of those improvement was not sustained upon resupination. It remains unclear whether pronation averts intubation, accelerates recovery, or reduces mortality. Future data are warranted to identify the optimal indications for and duration of pronation, and assessment of response.Technical details regarding application of HFNC and NIV are provided separately. (See ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"" and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Practical aspects of initiation"" and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"".)Precautions for noninvasive modalities — HFNC and NIV are considered aerosol generating procedures. Thus, when HFNC or NIV is used, airborne in addition to standard precautions should be undertaken (ie, airborne infection isolation room [also known as a negative pressure room], full personal protective equipment). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●HFNC – We advocate additionally placing a surgical or N95 mask on the patient during HFNC when healthcare workers are in the room, but the value of this practice is unknown [3]. Additional precautions for HFNC that have potential to reduce risk include starting at and using the lowest effective flow rate (eg, 20 L/minute and 0.4 FiO2). Inhaled medications or gases (eg, epoprostenol, nitric oxide bronchodilators) should be avoided during HFNC. ●NIV – If NIV is initiated, a full-face mask rather than a nasal or oronasal mask is preferred to minimize particle dispersion. The mask should preferably have a good seal and not have an anti-asphyxiation valve or port. Use of a helmet has been proposed for delivering NIV to patients with COVID-19 [66]. However, experience is limited with this delivery method, especially in the United States. If NIV is used, dual limb circuitry with a filter on the expiratory limb on a critical care ventilator may decrease dispersion compared with single limb circuitry on portable devices, although data to support this are lacking. We also suggest starting with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) using the lowest effective pressures (eg, 5 to 10 cm H2O).There are few data regarding aerosolization during HFNC and NIV. In a normal lung simulation study, dispersion of air during exhalation increased with increasing HFNC flow from 65 mm (at 10 L/minute) to 172 mm (at 60 L/minute) mostly along the sagittal plane (ie, above the nostrils) [67]. Similar distances were found when CPAP was delivered via nasal pillows (up to 332 mm with CPAP 20 cm H2O). However, there was no significant leakage noted when CPAP was administered via an oronasal mask with good seal (picture 2 and picture 3). Air leak increased when connections on any device were loose. Dispersion seemed to be reduced when the simulator simulated injured lung. Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients) — Nebulizers are associated with aerosolization and potentially increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In patients with suspected or documented COVID-19, nebulized bronchodilator therapy should be reserved for acute bronchospasm (eg, in the setting of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation). Otherwise, nebulized therapy should generally be avoided, in particular for indications without a clear evidence-base; however some uses (eg, hypertonic saline for cystic fibrosis) may need to be individualized. Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) with spacer devices should be used instead of nebulizers for management of chronic conditions (eg, asthma or COPD controller therapy). Patients can use their own MDIs if the hospital does not have them on formulary.If nebulized therapy is used, patients should be in an airborne infection isolation room, and healthcare workers should use contact and airborne precautions with appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE); this includes a N95 mask with goggles and face shield or equivalent (eg, powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR] mask]) as well as gloves and gown. All non-essential personnel should leave the room during nebulization. Some experts also suggest not re-entering the room for two to three hours following nebulizer administration. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Other — Potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should inform the use of other interventions in patients with documented or suspected COVID-19: ●It is prudent to minimize the following: •Positive airway devices for chronic nocturnal ventilation support•Chest physical therapy or oscillatory devices•Oral or airway suctioning●Sputum induction should be avoided●Bronchoscopy should be avoided in spontaneously breathing patients and limited to therapeutic indications (eg, life-threatening hemoptysis, central airway stenosis)If any of these therapies are performed, similar PPE to that described for nebulizer therapy should be used. (See 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)' above and ""Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview"".) THE DECISION TO INTUBATETiming — Timing of intubation in this population is challenging. Most patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 will warrant intubation and mechanical ventilation. Delaying intubation until the patient acutely decompensates is potentially harmful to the patient and healthcare workers and is not advised. For patients with escalating oxygen requirements, we monitor clinical and gas exchange parameters every one to two hours and have a low threshold to intubate patients with the following:●Rapid progression over hours  ●Lack of improvement on >40 L/minute of high flow oxygen and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) >0.6●Evolving hypercapnia, increasing work of breathing, increasing tidal volume, worsening mental status ●Hemodynamic instability or multiorgan failureMost experts with experience managing COVID-19 patients suggest “early” intubation. However, the definition of what constitutes “early” is unclear. Use of noninvasive means are traditionally used to avoid intubation. However, their use is subject to controversy in patients with COVID-19 (see 'Patients with higher oxygen requirements' above). Clinicians should communicate closely and regularly about the potential for intubation in patients that are being followed and treated noninvasively so that the transition for intubation can be smooth and rapid once it has been identified that the patient needs intubation.  Precautions — Intubation is the highest risk procedure for droplet dispersion in patients with COVID-19 [59,68]. The following discussion is suitable for patients outside the operating room (eg, intensive care unit [ICU] and emergency department) (table 2). ●We are proponents of the development of intubation kits and intubation checklists for performing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in this population (figure 1). ●Attention should be paid to donning full contact and airborne personal protective equipment (PPE) (figure 2 and figure 3) [59]. Appropriate PPE includes a fit-tested disposable N95 respirator mask (picture 4), with eye protection or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), also known as an isolation suit (picture 5 and picture 6). Also included are gown, caps and beard covers, protective footwear, neck covering, and gloves (using the double glove technique). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●Intubation should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room, if possible.●Intubation should be performed by the most qualified individual (eg, anesthesiologist) since delayed intubation with multiple attempts may prolong dispersion and place the patient at risk of a respiratory arrest.  ●Anecdotally, most experts suggest optimizing preoxygenation with nonaerosol-generating means (eg, avoidance of high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannula) and intubation using video laryngoscopy. In patients previously on high flow oxygen, some experts switch to 100 percent nonrebreather masks for preoxygenation. ●When manual bag mask ventilation (BMV) is needed, switching the mask to a supraglottic device for manual bagging is appropriate. When feasible, BMV should be minimized before and after intubation, and a bacterial/viral high efficiency hydrophobic filter should be placed between the facemask and breathing circuit or resuscitation bag. Having a pre-prepared bag-mask with filter attached in every room with a COVID-19 patient is prudent. Using a two-person technique for an adequate face mask seal is also suggested.●Clamping the endotracheal tube (ETT) for connections and disconnections is appropriate (eg, capnography testing following intubation), only if the patient is NOT spontaneously breathing. ●The ventilator and ventilator circuitry should be ready in advance with preplanned settings already entered so that as soon as the ETT is placed and confirmed with capnography, it can be connected directly to the ETT without additional manual bagging. In addition, if feasible, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy should be prepared and attached to the ventilator tubing in advance in order to avoid unnecessary disconnection for their placement at a later point in time. The expiratory limb on the ventilator should have a HEPA filter to decrease contamination of the ventilator and environment and protect staff when changing limb circuitry. ●To minimize exposure, bundling intubation with other procedures is appropriate as is bundling the chest radiograph for ETT and central venous catheter placement.●Doffing should follow strict procedure and some experts also advocate for the use of viricidal wipes for areas of exposed skin during intubation (eg, neck) (figure 3).New proposals are emerging for novel barrier protections for intubation. In one such pilot study, manually performing intubation inside a transparent box was described (“aerosol box”) [69]. The box was designed so that it could be placed over a patient’s head allowing intubation to be performed through two circular ports on the cephalad side of the box. In a simulation experiment, cough was approximated using a latex balloon and fluorescent dye. Use of the box was associated with significant reduction in aerosol deposition to the individual performing intubation, their PPE clothing, and the surrounding environment, when compared with the same simulation without the box. While proposed as an adjunct to protection, restriction of hand movements may be encountered during airway manipulation that would necessitate abandoning the procedure and the simulation may not accurately mimic the aerosolization behavior of virus particles. Such devices are not yet commercially available.  Detailed guidance regarding intubation in the operating room, optimal personal protective equipment, and procedural details regarding intubation itself are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"" and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19' and ""Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults"" and ""Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room"" and ""The decision to intubate"" and ""Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room"" and ""Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside of the operating room"".)VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME — Most patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated appear to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Accurate data on duration of ventilation are limited but suggest prolonged mechanical ventilation for two weeks or more (table 1). All of the steps discussed below should proceed as resources allow. Whether different phases of COVID-19 pneumonitis require different ventilatory strategies is unclear. One school of thought is that in the early phase of COVID-19, severe hypoxemia is associated with high compliance and low alveolar recruitability (atypical ARDS), while in the later phase, severe hypoxemia is associated with low lung compliance and high recruitability (classic ARDS) [70,71]. However, this hypothesis, remains unproven and optimal ventilatory strategies based upon it are unclear. Until further data are available, we prefer a strategy that promotes lung protection as outlined in the sections below.Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) — As for all patients with ARDS, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who develop ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation should receive LTVV targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW; range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW (table 3 and table 4)). We typically use a volume-limited assist control mode, beginning with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW, which targets a plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤30 cm H2O, and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table (table 5). This approach is based upon several randomized trials and meta-analyses that have reported improved mortality from LTVV in patients with ARDS. The experience among Chinese, Italian, and United States cohorts is that this approach is also beneficial in this population. Modifications to or deviations from this mechanical ventilation strategy may be required in the setting of severe hypercapnia or ventilator dyssynchrony (figure 4). (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Patients who are not improving or deteriorating'.)Anecdotal reports suggest that the COVID-19 ARDS phenotype is one of severe hypoxemia that is responsive to high PEEP with relatively high lung compliance such that Pplat ≤30 cm H2O is not difficult to achieve. As a consequence, we and other clinicians have a low threshold to start with higher than usual levels of PEEP (eg, 10 to 15 cm H2O).Expanded details on LTVV and other ventilator strategies in ARDS are provided separately. (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"".)   We believe that oxygenation goals in critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be similar to those in nonventilated patients (ie, peripheral oxygen saturation between 90 and 96 percent (see 'Oxygenation targets' above)). However, in patents with COVID-19, some experts use a higher peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) goal [7]. The rationale for this approach is that it may reduce the frequency of ventilator adjustments that require staff entry into the room, thereby reducing the risk to healthcare staff, although data are lacking to support it.Reflecting the practice of LTVV, one retrospective Italian cohort reported that the median level of PEEP was 14 cm H2O (interquartile range [IQR] 12 to 16 cm H2O) [24]. Ninety percent of patients required an FiO2 >0.5, and the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 160 (IQR, 114 to 220).Failure of low tidal volume ventilation — For patients with COVID-19 that fail to achieve adequate oxygenation with LTVV, we agree with other experts in the field who have chosen prone ventilation as the preferred next step. For its application, we use similar criteria to those in non-COVD-19 patients (ie, partial arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2:FiO2] ratio <150 mmHg, a FiO2 ≥0.6, and PEEP ≥5 cm H2O; excessively high airway pressures; or recalcitrant hypoxemia), although some experts use a higher PaO2:FiO2 ratio, given the good response seen in this population.  Prone ventilation — Our preference for using prone ventilation is based on its known efficacy in patients with ARDS as well as limited and anecdotal observations of intensivists in the field who have noted that unlike patients who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), patients with COVID-19-related ARDS respond well to this maneuver [72]. Those who are experienced in ventilating patients with COVID-19-related ARDS also promote ventilating patients prone for as long as is feasible without prematurely returning the patient to the supine position (ie, 12 to 16 hours prone per day) and to perform the maneuver at change of shift when sufficient staff are available. The utmost care should be taken to avoid ventilator disconnections during proning and the number of personnel should be limited to that required for turning. This video which describes the prone procedure is freely available. Additional details regarding the efficacy, contraindications (table 6) and application (table 7) of prone ventilation are provided separately. (See ""Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Ventilator strategies to maximize alveolar recruitment'.) The good response to prone positioning may be due to preserved lung compliance in this population compared with patients who develop ARDS from other etiologies. Lung compliance is the change in lung volume for a given pressure. It can be measured using the following equations: lung compliance (C) = change in lung volume (V) / change in transpulmonary pressure (alveolar pressure [Palv] – pleural pressure [Ppl]); static lung compliance = tidal volume / Pplat – PEEP. The normal lung compliance is approximately 200 mL/cm H2O and in general compliance >50 mL/cm H2O has been noted by clinicians who have experienced ventilating patients with COVID-19. Optimal timing and criteria for discontinuing prone ventilation is unclear and should be performed on an individualized basis. It is not unreasonable to use criteria similar to that in studies that have shown benefit in non-COVID-related ARDS (eg PaO2:FiO2 ≥150 mmHg, FiO2 ≤0.6, PEEP ≤10 cm H2O) maintained for at least four hours after the end of the last prone session) [73].Additional measures — Additional options for patients in whom prone ventilation fails include the following:●Recruitment and high PEEP – Recruitment maneuvers and high PEEP strategies (table 8) may be performed to address severe hypoxemia [8]; data supporting their use in non COVID-19-related ARDS is described separately. (See ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"", section on 'Ventilator strategies to maximize alveolar recruitment'.)●Pulmonary vasodilators – Pulmonary vasodilators may improve ventilation-perfusion mismatch in patients with severe hypoxemia (eg, PaO2:FiO2 <100) and may be especially helpful in those with decompensated or acute pulmonary arterial hypertension [8]. However, pulmonary vasodilators do not improve mortality in all-cause ARDS and should not be used instead of evidence-based therapies such as prone positioning. Namely, in a patient whose PaO2:FiO2 ratio meets proning criteria, but numerically improves with the initiation of pulmonary vasodilators, prone positioning should not be withheld. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Investigational agents'.)The two most commonly used agents are inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) and aerosolized epoprostenol, which are administered by continuous inhalation. After initiating iNO or epoprostenol, the response is typically noted within a few hours (eg, 10 percent reduction in FiO2 requirement). The choice of agent is typically institution dependent based on local expertise and cost. While some centers use a single agent, other centers use an initial trial of iNO (eg, 30 parts per million [PPM] for one hour) to determine responsiveness; responders are continued on iNO or transitioned to inhaled epoprostenol. iNO may be preferred since it is associated with a less frequent need to change filters with resultant reduction in the risk to the respiratory healthcare provider. Inhaled vasodilators should only be administered through a closed system and require skilled personnel for their use. Potential risks and challenges with COVID-19 patients include aerosolization and clogging of bacterial/viral filters used in ventilator circuits, particularly with epoprostenol. Further details regarding their use are described separately. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Nitric oxide' and ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Prostacyclin' and ""Inhaled nitric oxide in adults: Biology and indications for use"", section on 'Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure'.) ●Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) – NMBAs may be reserved for patients with refractory hypoxemia or ventilator dyssynchrony. We do not favor their routine use in any patient with ARDS since data on outcomes are conflicting. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Paralysis (neuromuscular blockade)' and ""Neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients: Use, agent selection, administration, and adverse effects"".) ●Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – While the World Health Organization suggests ECMO as a rescue strategy, we only use it in those who fail prone ventilation and the other evidence-based medical strategies listed above. In addition, ECMO is not universally available. As many hospitals choose to cohort patients in COVID-19-only intensive care units (ICUs), there may also be the challenge of delivering ECMO in ICUs that do not routinely care for ECMO patients; this would require the recruitment of additional specialized nursing and perfusionist staff. ECMO can also reduce the lymphocyte count and raise the interleukin-6 level, thereby interfering with the interpretation of these laboratory results [74]. (See ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".)Use of rescue strategies has varied among centers. Among 66 mechanically-ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Boston, Massachusetts, 31 (47 percent) underwent prone positioning, 18 (27 percent) were treated with inhaled vasodilator, and 3 (5 percent) received ECMO; overall mortality was 27 percent at a minimum follow-up of 30 days [75]. In a single-center retrospective cohort of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, approximately 12 percent received prone ventilation and 12 percent received ECMO [10]. In contrast, in the original cohort of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, of the 17 patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, 24 percent were treated with ECMO. Similarly, in an Italian cohort, only 1 percent of critically ill patients received ECMO [24]. Additional ventilator precautions — We recommend tight seals for all ventilator circuitry and equipment. For patients who have a tracheostomy, similar recommendations apply. Although the efficacy is unproven, some experts suggest placing the ventilator and intravenous (IV) line monitors outside the room, when feasible (eg, through a wall port). This allows frequent ventilator adjustments while simultaneously decreasing the risk of exposure to staff; although the efficacy of such maneuvers is unproven. It is prudent to avoid unnecessary disconnection with the endotracheal tube (ETT) in ventilated patients with COVID-19 in order to avoid derecruitment and unnecessary exposure of virus to the environment. For example, in-line suction devices and in-line adapters for bronchoscopy are preferred, if resources allow. If disconnection is necessary (eg, during transfer when portable ventilators are used or manual bagging), the ETT should be temporarily clamped during disconnection and unclamped after reconnection. This is considered an aerosolizing procedure in which case an airborne infection isolation room is preferable but is not always feasible.Other infection precautions include use of dual limb ventilator circuitry with filters placed at the exhalation outlets as well as heat moisture exchange (HME) systems rather than heated humification of single limb circuits. HME should be placed between the exhalation port and the ETT (figure 5 and figure 6). (See ""The ventilator circuit"".)It is particularly important to adhere to the standard practice of maintaining the ETT cuff pressure between 25 and 30 cm H2O so that a tight seal exists between the cuff and the tracheal wall. (See ""Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients"", section on 'Maintain optimal cuff pressure'.)All ventilators should have appropriate filters in place and agreed upon filter change schedule (eg, every six hours). The ventilator should be wiped down after every filter change. Although an airborne isolation room is ideal, if not feasible, patients can be ventilated in a non-isolation room but need to be transported to an airborne isolation room when aerosol generating procedures take place (eg, extubation, bronchoscopy). Having a protocol in place for transport is prudent. INTERVENTIONS — Ventilated patients require frequent evaluation and develop complications that require intervention. Details relevant to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are included in this section and mostly relate to infectious precautions. In a biodistribution study of 1070 specimens obtained from 205 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens showed the highest positive rates (93 percent), followed by sputum (72 percent), nasal swabs (63 percent), fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (46 percent), pharyngeal swabs (32 percent), feces (29 percent), and blood (1 percent). No urine specimens tested positive [76]. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in several specimens, although the reported rates in this study may have been determined by the severity of illness of the individual tested. In a systematic review of 10 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to healthcare workers, endotracheal intubation had the highest risk (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 2.3-18.9), followed by noninvasive ventilation (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.8), tracheostomy (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5-11.5), and bag-mask ventilation [77]. Other procedures were associated with a lower or insignificant risk of transmission but it is not known whether they can be applied to SARS-CoV-2. For example, duration of close contact during aerosolizing procedures and precautions used were not described. Collection of respiratory specimens in the intubated patient — Some intubated patients require upper or lower respiratory tract sampling for diagnostic purposes (eg, diagnosis of COVID-19 or ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]). Technically, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs do not have to be taken under airborne precautions. However, we prefer to obtain naso- and oropharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates under airborne precautions in the intensive care unit (ICU). Nonbronchoscopic alveolar lavage (“mini-BAL”) may also be performed as an alternative to bronchoscopy, although experience in this procedure is not universal among ICUs. If mini-BAL is performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, use of smaller aliquots of lavage fluid is prudent (eg, three 10 mL aliquots to obtain 2 to 3 mL of fluid). (See ""Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia"", section on 'Invasive respiratory sampling'.)Bronchoscopy — We agree with the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) that bronchoscopy should have a limited role for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and should only be performed for this indication when upper respiratory samples are negative (ie, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, or non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage) and the suspicion remains high. Bronchoscopy may also be performed when another diagnosis is being considered and a bronchoscopic sample would change management (eg, suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii in an immunosuppressed patient) or when therapeutic bronchoscopy is indicated (eg, life-threatening hemoptysis or airway stenosis).  Bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure and should only be performed when necessary and likely to change management. Bronchoscopy through an established airway (eg, endotracheal tube [ETT]) likely carries less risk than bronchoscopy in a spontaneously breathing patient. In patients with COVID-19, bronchoscopy should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room. Airborne precautions and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned before entering the room. Using PPE similar to that described for intubation is appropriate. (See 'The decision to intubate' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Using ETTs with inline adapters for bronchoscopy is ideal to prevent disconnection from the ventilator and aerosolization. If bronchoscopy is needed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, then we suggest small aliquots of 10 mL to obtain 2 to 3 mL of lavage fluid placed in a sterile leak-proof container. Clamping suction tubing or turning off suction after the sample has been obtained before disconnecting the sample from the device is also prudent. Specimens should be in a double zip-locked sealed plastic bag, handled with the usual precautions, and labelled clearly as “COVID-19.”We prefer the use of disposable bronchoscopes, although these are not universally available. For nondisposable equipment, we recommend cleaning the suction channels with standard cleaning solutions typically used for highly infectious material. We also suggest covering or sealing any vessel containing the bronchoscope during transport after use and wiping down the transport cart and bronchoscope display tower before leaving the room. Wipe down solution should be hydrogen peroxide or equivalent and should be left wet on all surfaces for at least one minute. Extubation and weaning — Patients are often ready for extubation while they remain infectious, and because extubation is frequently associated with some coughing, it is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. Similar to intubation, we encourage the use of extubation protocols and check lists specific to each institution.●Weaning – Readiness for extubation should follow standard practice of performing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). However, COVID-specific approaches include the following:•Equipment – We suggest using closed systems and not using a T-piece trial for SBTs.•SBTs – To reduce the risk of reintubation following extubation, we prefer a higher degree of readiness in patients with COVID-19. This practice varies and may include higher criteria for passing an SBT. For example, some experts use lower pressure support ventilation [PSV] parameters (eg, 0 to 5 cm H2O) rather than the typical 7 cm H2O during the trial while others promote SBT for longer periods (eg, two to four hours rather than the typical two hours). The rationale for altered criteria is based upon the observation that patients with COVID-19 are intubated for longer periods than non-COVID-patients [24] and anecdotal evidence that suggests a high volume of secretions and airway edema; all of these factors place the patient at high risk of post extubation respiratory failure requiring reintubation. In addition, we prefer extubating patients directly to low-flow oxygen rather than high flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae (HFNC) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV), which may risk virus aerosolization. (See ""Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing"" and ""Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation"", section on 'Spontaneous breathing trial' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Cuff leak test – Whether the cuff leak test (CLT) should be performed routinely prior to extubation is unclear. However, its performance may be guided by clinical suspicion for upper airway edema (eg, fluid overload) or the presence of risk factors for post extubation stridor (eg, prolonged intubation ≥6 days, age >80 years, large endotracheal tube, traumatic intubation). Performing the cuff leak test should be weighed against the potential risk of aerosolization, and similar to extubation, it should be preferentially done in an airborne isolation room. In our institution, we routinely administer glucocorticoids (eg, methylprednisolone 20 mg intravenously every four hours for a total of four doses) to most patients with COVID-19 before extubation and only extubate those in whom the CLT is positive after glucocorticoids. We base this practice upon the high rate of airway edema noted in our population but understand that practice may vary depending upon the population served. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Cuff leak'.)●Extubation – We prefer to perform extubation in an airborne isolation room. Respiratory therapists and others in the room during extubation should adhere to airborne precautions including N95 masks with eye protection or equivalent. In general, only two people are needed and extra staff outside the room should be available to help with additional equipment. Some experts use medications to decrease coughing (eg, lidocaine via ETT, low-dose opioid bolus, dexmedetomidine, remifentanil if available), although data to support the routine use of anti-tussives are limited. In the ICU, close communication with a clinician experienced in intubation regarding the occurrence of extubation in a COVID-19 patient is prudent, in case rapid reintubation is needed, particularly for patients pre-designated as having a difficult airway.Both low-flow and high-flow oxygen systems should be set up and readily available. We drape the patient’s chest and face with a plastic cover to provide barrier protection between the patient and the operator (eg, a plastic poncho). We typically put the ventilator in standby mode (or switch off) immediately prior to extubation. After balloon deflation, extra care should be taken during extubation to keep the inline suction catheter engaged during cuff deflation and to have another handheld suction catheter available for the removal of pharyngeal and oral sections. The endotracheal tube should be removed as smoothly as is feasible during inspiration, and disposed of into a biohazard plastic bag bundled together with the ventilator tubing, the plastic drape, and tape/ETT holders, and inline suction catheter. The bag is sealed and disposed of immediately. Further details regarding extubation are provided separately. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Extubation equipment and technique'.)●Post-extubation care – The patient is monitored following the procedure. The threshold to reintubate patients with postextubation respiratory failure should be low. Postextubation care should support the application of supplemental oxygen at the lowest fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) possible, preferably via low flow nasal canula. Because patients are often extubated while they remain infectious, we would advise adhering to a similar approach to oxygen delivery as before intubation. (See ""Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit"", section on 'Postextubation management' and 'Oxygenation targets' above.)The procedure for palliative extubation should be similar except care following extubation also includes palliative medication and cessation of neuromuscular blockade. Precautions for extubation in the OR are provided separately. (See ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)  Tracheostomy — Reports from experts in the field suggest that many patients fail early attempts at weaning (eg, within the first week), although this does not appear to predict their eventual ability to wean and extubate. However, some patients require tracheostomy (in our experience <10 percent of ICU admissions). ●Indications – Indications appear to be similar to non-COVID patients (eg, failed extubation, secretion management, airway edema, neurological impairment such as that which impairs airway protection).●Timing – The optimal timing for tracheostomy is unknown in COVID-19 patients. In non-COVID patients, changes in practice have led to most intensivists performing tracheostomy around day 7 to 10 following initial intubation. Although most intensivists perform tracheostomy approximately 7 to 10 days following initial intubation in patients without COVID-19, it seems reasonable to defer tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 beyond this time frame. COVID-19 patients appear to require mechanical ventilation longer than other patients (eg, two to three weeks), but can still be successfully extubated after this point.  ●Procedure – Tracheostomy is considered a high risk procedure for aerosolization. •Both open and percutaneous tracheostomy procedures are acceptable in COVID patients. •The exact procedure should be determined in advance and at the discretion of the operator with the minimum number of personnel. •To minimize cough, neuromuscular blockade is prudent. •It is preferable that the procedure be done at the bedside in an airborne isolation room. The operator should wear appropriate PPE similar to other aerosol generating procedures. The tracheostomy tube should have the syringe attached for immediate balloon inflation once inserted. In addition, adapters with inline suction catheters attached is also appropriate. (See 'Precautions' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)•Procedures such as open suctioning, dressing changes, inner cannula care, and tracheostomy changes are also considered as aerosol-generating. Thus, post tracheostomy care should also occur in an airborne isolation room, if feasible (if not, consider a portable HEPA-filtration unit). Novel barrier protections for performing tracheostomy have been proposed. In one report, tracheostomy was performed under an aerosol-reduction cover with a high-efficiency particulate air filtration unit placed close to the surgical field [78]. However, no description of aerosol deposition was provided. ●Prolonged weaning – Tracheostomy collar trials can be safely done in an airborne isolation room with resumption of ventilation and a closed loop system following the trial. However, some institutions use a portable HEPA filter to generate negative pressure in a room or use closed systems and dual limb circuitry with a HEPA filter attached to the exhalation limb to minimize environmental contamination. A surgical mask over the tracheostomy itself may also theoretically limit droplet spread.  Once a patient can breathe for 24 hours on a tracheostomy collar (or similar), they can undergo trials of a speaking valve and “capping” with the balloon deflated. Placing a speaking valve and capping would be considered aerosol generating so airborne precautions are warranted. However, once a speaking valve is in place or the tracheostomy is capped, aerosolization is less of a consideration and is the equivalent of a patient with a cough and on low flow oxygen and the patients may wear a mask over their nose and mouth. Decannulation is considered an aerosol-generating procedure, and provided the patient remains infectious, all the usual airborne precautions should be taken.  ●Repeat testing – Some institutions perform repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine when to discontinue infection control precautions and inform resource allocation. Whether tracheal or nasopharyngeal swabs should be used for this purpose is uncertain. If patients are tested and have a positive test, we continue precautions until two tests collected 24 hours apart are negative; however, it remains uncertain whether viral RNA detection during recovery reflects transmissible infection. (See 'Precautions' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.) .  Further details regarding tracheostomy are provided separately. (See ""Overview of tracheostomy"".)Cardiopulmonary resuscitation — In the event of a cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should proceed with all members of the team wearing appropriate PPE. Practicing a test run of a COVID-19 patient cardiac arrest is prudent. Bag-mask ventilation should be avoided (if feasible); the ventilator can be used instead to deliver a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute (bpm). Guidance for advanced cardiac life support and CPR in patients who are prone and cannot be returned to the supine position is provided separately. (See ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"", section on 'Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)' and ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"".)Other interventions — Guidance is lacking regarding other procedures commonly performed in the ICU. Many intubated patients have routine indications for central venous and arterial access for monitoring and for vasoactive drug infusion. Grouping standard procedures such as central venous catheter and arterial lines immediately following intubation is appropriate to minimize the frequency of exposure. The transmission risk of blood is unknown but likely to be low [76]. Significant pleural effusions and barotrauma appear to be unusual as a manifestation of COVID-19. In general, emergently indicated procedures and interventions should be performed as indicated, with appropriate infectious precautions. (See 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)  Transfer of COVID-19 patients should be limited to necessary trips (eg, imaging for a diagnosis that would change management, travel to an airborne isolation room for high risk aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation and extubation). SUPPORTIVE CARE — General supportive care of the critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is similar to that in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to other causes and is discussed in detail separately. Select issues pertinent to COVID-19 are discussed in the sections below. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Supportive care'.) Routine measures — The supportive care of mechanically ventilated patients that also apply to patients with COVID-19 are provided in several linked topics. However, potential differences that may pertain to COVID-19 patients are discussed in this section:Venous thromboembolism prevention — We agree with the American Society of Hematology and the Society of Critical Care Medicine that routine pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is warranted, preferably with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; eg, enoxaparin 40 mg SC once daily), unless there is a contraindication (eg, bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia). (See ""Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults"".)Because the risk of VTE appears to be higher than usual in this population, use of more aggressive VTE prophylaxis in the form of increased intensity of a pharmacologic agent (eg, enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, unfractionated heparin 7500 units every eight hours) and/or the addition of a mechanical device is prudent. Markedly elevated D-dimer levels, which correlate with a poor prognosis, are used by some experts to guide intensification of anticoagulation (eg, >6 times the upper limit of normal). For patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute, enoxaparin should be reduced to 30 mg daily or changed to unfractionated heparin depending on the severity of kidney impairment and patient weight. Fondaparinux is appropriate in those with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We believe that administering therapeutic anticoagulation (as a form of prophylaxis) may be assessed on an individual basis. However the indications for therapeutic anticoagulation, outside of documented VTE, are unclear but may include those with presumed VTE (eg, sudden unexplained deterioration in oxygenation or hemodynamic instability, acute cor pulmonale) and clotting of vascular devices (eg, venous, arterial devices, and hemodialysis devices).  Detailed descriptions of the VTE risk and management of COVID-19 patients with hypercoagulability are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)Sedation and analgesia — Anecdotal evidence suggests that requirements for sedation and analgesia appear high in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and that heavy use of sedatives and analgesic medication is required for ventilator synchrony. In our practice, we target a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS (table 9)) of -1 to -2 (or similar on a different scoring system), and in patients with ventilator dyssynchrony, a RASS of -2 to -3. RASS of -4 to -5 are targeted in those with severe dyssynchrony and those requiring neuromuscular blockade. For those requiring intravenous (IV) infusions, propofol and fentanyl are generally the preferred agents. However, shortages of sedatives may influence the choice of agent. We also quickly transition to oral medications, provided that fluid resuscitation is adequate (eg, oxycodone, hydromorphone, lorazepam, diazepam). Further details regarding indications, daily awakening, protocols, and dosing are provided separately. (See ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal"" and ""Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects"" and ""Pain control in the critically ill adult patient"".)Others — Other supportive measures are included here.●Nutritional support – The same principles of nutrition in non COVID-19 critically ill patients should be applied to critically-ill COVID-19 patients. We are not proponents of extra protein supplementation, vitamin C or D supplementation, or trace element supplementation over and above the usual recommended daily doses. (See ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview"" and ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition"" and ""Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition"".)●Glucose control. (See ""Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness"".)●Stress ulcer prophylaxis. (See ""Stress ulcers in the intensive care unit: Diagnosis, management, and prevention"" and ""Management of stress ulcers"".)●Hemodynamic monitoring. (See ""Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults"" and ""Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults"" and ""Novel tools for hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill patients with shock"".)●Fever management. (See ""Fever in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Outcomes'.)●Early physical therapy. (See ""Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)"", section on 'Prevention and treatment'.)●Ventilator-associated pneumonia precautions. (See ""Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults"".)Monitoring for complications — Critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be followed routinely for the development of complications associated with critical illness from COVID-19 or extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only essential personnel should enter the rooms of infected patients when performing daily examinations, care, and procedures. Common complications include acute kidney injury, mild transaminitis, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusions, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and superinfection (eg, ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]) (see 'Clinical features and complications' above). We suggest that daily laboratory studies include complete blood count with differential, chemistries, liver function and coagulation studies, arterial blood gases, ferritin level, D-dimer level, and lactate dehydrogenase. Serial measurement of cardiac troponins and a low threshold transthoracic echocardiogram may be helpful to evaluate for suspected cardiac injury.Daily chest radiographs are not recommended routinely for mechanically ventilated patients with or without COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated, chest radiographs should only be performed when there is an indication (eg, catheter- or endotracheal tube [ETT]-placement or a relevant clinical change). Chest computed tomography and other imaging should be limited to those in whom testing would change management. This rationale is based upon the increased risk of viral shedding with procedures that require transfer out of the intensive care unit (ICU). (See ""Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients"", section on 'Reassessment of position'.) Fluid and electrolytes management — Unless patients have sepsis or volume depletion from high fever or gastrointestinal losses, we prefer conservative fluid management typical of that advised for patients with ARDS. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Fluid management' and ""Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"", section on 'Intravenous fluids (first three hours)' and ""Treatment of severe hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults"".)The management of patients who present with septic shock due to COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with septic shock from other causes. (See ""Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults"".)Glucocorticoids — We agree with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) that glucocorticoids should not be routinely administered to patients with COVID-19, unless there is a separate evidence-based indication (eg, asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation, refractory septic shock, and adrenal insufficiency). However, their administration in critically ill patients with COVID-19-related ARDS is controversial. Based on data suggesting potential benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with all-cause ARDS, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) provides a conditional, weak recommendation in favor of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19 who have severe ARDS (eg, patients with a partial arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2:FiO2] <100 mmHg). Although we also weakly recommend glucocorticoids in moderate to severe “all cause” ARDS (ie, non COVID-19-related ARDS) who fail low tidal volume ventilation, we do not suggest administering them routinely in the setting of COVID-19 and ARDS (see ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'). The rationale for not administering glucocorticoids in this population is that the data supporting any benefit did not include a sufficient proportion of patients with viral pneumonia to inform safety (eg, patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East Respiratory syndrome [MERS], or influenza); this is especially important since data in patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia were conflicting and some suggested harm [79-82]. If clinicians choose to administer glucocorticoids, the SCCM suggests that they should begin within the first 14 days, doses should be low, and courses should be short (eg, intravenous dexamethasone 20 mg IV once daily for five days, then 10 mg once daily for five days). Data in COVID-19 patients are limited to a single retrospective Chinese cohort, where methylprednisolone administration reduced the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients who did not receive methylprednisolone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38; 95% CI 0.2-0.71) [27]. However, these data are fundamentally flawed and new data gathered prospectively should shed light on this controversial issue. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Limited role of glucocorticoids'.)As noted above, management of patients who present with shock due to COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with septic shock from other causes (see 'Fluid and electrolytes management' above). Low dose glucocorticoids are not routinely advised for septic shock. In the setting of COVID-19 and shock, we reserve low dose glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone 200 to 400 mg/day in divided doses) for selected patients with refractory shock, in accordance with guidelines [7]. Low dose glucocorticoids are not routinely advised for non-refractory septic shock. The use of glucocorticoids in septic shock is discussed separately. (See ""Glucocorticoid therapy in septic shock in adults"", section on 'Administration'.)Nebulized medication — Nebulization is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. For patients with COVID-19 who are intubated and require bronchodilators for an evidence-based indication (eg, acute bronchospasm from asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation), we prefer the use of in-line metered dose inhalers (MDIs; ie, pressurized inhalers) rather than administration via a standard jet or vibrating mesh nebulizer due to the lower risk of aerosolization associated with MDIs [83,84]. For medications that can only be administered via a nebulizer, consideration should be given to stopping the medication if it is not essential for acute care (eg, inhaled colistin for patients with bronchiectasis) or using an MDI alternative, if available on formulary (eg, tobramycin capsule inhaler). Consideration should be given to the patient using their own supply if MDIs are not on formulary. Placement of a filter at the expiratory port of the ventilation circuit during nebulization is prudent to minimize aerosolization into the room. Ideally, patients who require nebulizers, should be in an airborne infection isolation room. Only the healthcare staff necessary for nebulizer administration (eg, respiratory therapists or nurse) should be in the room for the initiation of the procedure and airborne precautions similar to those for intubation should be taken. (See 'The decision to intubate' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)Investigational COVID-19 agents — Several investigational agents have been proposed and individual institutions should work with their pharmacists and clinical researchers to enroll patients in clinical trials. We suggest the development of protocols by individual ICUs for the off-label use of investigational agents. This area is rapidly evolving and is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Management of co-infections and comorbidities — Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are intubated are at risk for developing VAP and other infections typical of all critically ill and/or intubated patients (eg, central line or urinary tract infections). When treating co-infections, potential drug interactions with any investigational COVID-19 agent should be assessed. Infectious disease experts should be involved early in the management of COVID-19 patients who are critically ill. Further details regarding management of chronic medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and angiotensin receptor inhibitors are provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Managing chronic medications'.)SPECIAL POPULATIONS — There are no specific recommendations for pregnant women who are critically-ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. Management should be similar to uninfected patients. Issues regarding transmission and risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women is described separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Pregnant and breastfeeding women' and ""Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period"" and ""Acute respiratory failure during pregnancy and the peripartum period"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".) In patients with sickle cell disease who are critically-ill with COVID-19 in whom acute chest syndrome is contributing to their illness, consideration of early exchange transfusions and surveillance for the development of acute pulmonary hypertension is prudent [85]. (See ""Acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease"", section on 'COVID-19'.)Issues that arise for other populations are provided in the following links:●Renal issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"")●Cardiac issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"")●Airway management and operating room issues (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"")●Cancer care (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"")PROGNOSISMortality — Early data are emerging describing outcomes from COVID-19 in critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2,9-11,23,24,26-28]. Mortality appears lower than that in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The mortality from COVID-19 appears driven by the presence of severe ARDS, and is approximately 50 percent (range 16 to 78 percent).●In a single-center retrospective cohort of 52 critically ill Chinese patients with COVID-19, 62 percent had died by 28 days with a median duration of only seven days from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to death [10]. Among the 20 patients who survived, three remained on mechanical ventilation, three were receiving noninvasive mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC), and six were receiving low flow oxygen. ●In a retrospective cohort of 201 Chinese patients with COVID-19, the mortality was 52 percent among those who developed ARDS [27]. Among those who received mechanical ventilation, 66 percent died, 21 percent were discharged and 13 percent remained hospitalized. ●In a preliminary study of 21 critically ill patients in the United States, by day 5, 67 percent of critically ill patients had died, 24 percent remained critically ill, and 9.5 percent were discharged from the ICU [21]. ●In an Italian cohort of 1591 patients, the ICU morality was 26 percent, but a significant proportion remained in the ICU at the time of the publication, which may have underestimated the true mortality [24]. Higher mortality was initially reported in males compared with females but this may have been due to the predominance of males affected with COVID-19 in the Chinese cohorts [9-11,27,28]; a similar difference has been noted in the preliminary reports from Italy but not from Washington state, USA [20,21]. Risk factors for death — Across countries, the consistent major risk factor associated with death in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is older age [10,11,19,22,24,26,27,86,87]. In two Chinese retrospective cohorts, death from ARDS was more likely to occur in those of older age ≥64 years (hazard ratio [HR] 6.17; 95% 3.26-11.67) [10,27]. Preliminary reports from Italy and the United States are reporting similar outcomes [19,20,22]. Other risk factors associated with death among critically ill patients include the following [10,11,19,22,24,26,27,88]:●The development of ARDS, particularly severe ARDS, and the need for mechanical ventilation●Comorbidities (eg, chronic cardiac and pulmonary conditions, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease)●Markers of inflammation or coagulation (eg, D-dimer level >1 microg/mL admission, elevated fibrin degradation products, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times)●Select laboratory studies (eg, worsening lymphopenia, neutrophilia)The rapidity of symptom progression does not appear to predict a worse outcome [10]While high fever was associated with a higher likelihood of developing ARDS (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.11-2.84), it appears to be associated with a lower likelihood of death (HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21-0.82) [10,27], a phenomenon that has been noted previously in some critically ill patients. (See ""Fever in the intensive care unit"", section on 'Outcomes'.) Further details on the risk factors associated with severe disease are provided separately. (See 'Risk factors for progression' above.)Long term sequelae — The percentage of patients that require long term care is unreported. Similarly, the incidence of critical care neuromyopathy is not yet documented. In our experience the rate may be higher than usual due to the prolonged nature of intubation in COVID-19 patients and higher use of neuromuscular blockade and sedatives, with or without concurrent glucocorticoid administration. (See ""Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness"".)The incidence of post-intensive care unit syndrome (PICS) is also unknown in COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, patients should be followed and treated for PICS which involves nutritional, physical, psychological, and occupational therapy. (See ""Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)"".)END OF LIFE ISSUES — In a public health emergency, values other than autonomy predominate. Like any critical illness, severe illness due to COVID-19 carries the potential of significant psychosocial distress to patients, families, and surrogates. In addition, unique aspects of COVID-19 and its management portend greater trauma including anxiety and stigma surrounding a novel pathogen and high-level isolation precautions including visitation limitation or prohibition including at the end of life. High levels of patient, family, and surrogate psychosocial distress should be anticipated and combatted with clear communication strategies and early palliative care involvement. Even if in-person visitation is not allowed due to public health care concerns, hospitals should promote internet based visual communication such as video communication between clinicians, families, and isolated patients.   Discussing end-of-life wishes with patients and their family should occur early in the course of management, including potentially even before diagnosis, especially in light of the poor outcomes for elderly patients with comorbidities who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require mechanical ventilation. Consultation with the palliative care teams and ethic experts should also be done to assist families in decision-making and assist clinicians with contentious issues or disagreement that may arise. Due to the unique aspects to addressing needs of patient and families in this pandemic, several online resources are available for clinicians to use when having COVID-19 specific discussions with patients and families. They provide helpful language and strategies for conversations about a range of issues including, but not limited to, triaging, discussing goals of care, resource allocation, and grieving including:●VIITALtalk ●Center to Advance Palliative Care ●National Coalition for Hospice an Palliative Care Further principles regarding ethical issues in the intensive care unit (ICU) and advance care planning are discussed separately. (See ""Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults"" and ""Ethics in the intensive care unit: Informed consent"" and ""Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit"" and ""Communication in the ICU: Holding a family meeting"" and ""Palliative care: Issues in the intensive care unit in adults"" and ""Advance care planning and advance directives"", section on 'COVID-19 resources'.)DISCHARGE AND LONG TERM CARE — For patients who extubate successfully and can be safely discharged home, routine community precautions apply. For patients who require a tracheostomy or are deconditioned from critical illness, transfer to a long term acute care (LTAC) facility is typical. However, there is no guidance on whether or when patients should be re-tested. Many, but not all, LTACs require two negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests performed 24 hours apart before accepting a patient with COVID-19. If positive testing delays transfer to an LTAC, continued infection control precautions are advised, and rehab and weaning should begin at the acute care facility. Discontinuation of infection control precautions is discussed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.) Outcomes in patients who require long term care are unknown. Treatment of patients who require admission to an LTAC should be similar to non-COVID patients. Particular attention should be paid to continuing venous thromboembolism prophylaxis until the acute illness fully resolves or the patient become mobile, although the efficacy of this approach is unknown. Duration of therapeutic anticoagulation should be guided by the indication; for example, a minimum of three months for documented or presumed VTE is appropriate while shorter durations are reasonable for device thrombosis. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".) The management of patients who require long term mechanical ventilation is discussed separately. (See ""Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation"".)SURGE CAPACITY AND SCARCE RESOURCE ALLOCATION — COVID-19 is a global pandemic and has placed significant increases in demand for acute and critical care services on hospitals in many regions. This has necessitated operations maneuvers to increase capacity to be able to provide care for more patients, for higher acuity patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation, and for patients with special isolation requirements. Surge capacity may be achieved by maximizing resources across three domains: ●Care spaces (ie, beds)●Staff●Physical equipmentIn the COVID-19 pandemic, this has included expanding ICU care into non-ICU spaces, utilizing non-critical care trained staff to participate in delivering critical care, and innovative approaches to obtain, conserve, and increase the efficiency of physical equipment including personal protective equipment (PPE; eg, repeat use of N95 masks) and mechanical ventilators (eg, double ventilation, repurposing operating room ventilators). As an example, some experts have published preliminary data to highlight the use of one ventilator for use in multiple patients [89]. However, this maneuver was designed for a disaster setting where one might reasonably expect that several patients might need life support at similar levels. Use of this measure as a life-saving measure in patients with COVID-19 could be complicated if patients are not matched well in terms of their ventilator settings. Potential use of anesthesia ventilators for longer-term mechanical ventilation is provided separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines"".)In some instances, such as in Italy, despite mobilizing to surge capacity, demand for care has still outpaced supply such that overt rationing has occurred [90]. All hospitals facing the potential of an acute surge event due to COVID-19 or another insult should have a process to approach the allocation of scarce resources such as ICU beds and mechanical ventilators [91,92]. Most individual states in the United States have guidance documents which can be adapted for local institutions [91]. General principles that guide and underpin scarce resource allocation policies include: ●Maximization of lives saved and/or life-years saved●Transparency ●Stakeholder and public input●Separation between the clinical team and the triage process (eg, ethics committees for difficult triage decisions)●Robust palliative care and supportive measures for patients who are not provided with critical care resourcesSOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), up to one-quarter require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. (See 'Introduction' above and 'Epidemiology' above.)●Profound hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the dominant finding in critically ill patients. Common complications include acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated liver enzymes, and the late development of cardiac injury, including sudden cardiac death. Sepsis, shock, and multi-organ failure are less common. (See 'Clinical features in critically ill patients' above.) ●For most critically ill patients with COVID-19, we prefer the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting a peripheral oxygen saturation between 90 and 96 percent. (See 'Respiratory care of the nonintubated patient' above and 'Oxygenation targets' above and 'Low flow oxygen' above.)•The use of high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is controversial based on infection control concerns and the frequent need for mechanical ventilation despite these measures. The decision to initiate noninvasive modalities requires balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of resources; this approach should be reassessed as new data becomes available. (See 'Patients with higher oxygen requirements' above.) •In patients with COVID-19 who have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and higher oxygen needs than low flow oxygen can provide, we suggest selective use of noninvasive measures rather than routinely proceeding directly to intubation (Grade 2C). As an example we might trial HFNC in younger patients without comorbidities who can tolerate nasal cannulae. In contrast, we may proceed directly to early intubation in patients at higher risk (eg, elderly patients and patients with comorbidities or risk factors for progression). •Among the noninvasive modalities we suggest HFNC rather than NIV (Grade 2C). Our preference for HFNC is based upon limited and inconsistent data, which, on balance, favors HFNC compared with NIV in HFNC in patients with non-COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. NIV via a full face mask (with a good seal) may be appropriate in patients with indications that have proven efficacy including acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and sleep disordered breathing. (See ""Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications"", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure' and ""Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications"", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'.).•For patients with COVID-19 who receive HFNC or NIV, vigilant monitoring is warranted for progression with frequent clinical and arterial blood gas evaluation every one to two hours to ensure efficacy and safe ventilation. The threshold to intubate such patients should be low. Attempting prone positioning is also appropriate. ●For critically ill patients with COVID-19, intubation should not be delayed until the patient acutely decompensates since this is potentially harmful to both the patient and healthcare workers. We have a low threshold to intubate those who have (see 'Timing' above):•Rapid progression over a few hours•Failure to improve despite HFNC >40 L/min and FiO2 >0.6•Development of hypercapnia•Hemodynamic instability or multiorgan failure ●Intubation is a high risk procedure for aerosol dispersion in patients with COVID-19 and attention should be paid to donning full personal protective equipment (PPE) with airborne precautions (figure 2 and figure 3) as well using equipment that minimizes dispersion (eg, video laryngoscopy) and the development of protocols for the procedure (eg, check lists) (table 2 and figure 1). (See 'Precautions' above and ""Safety in the operating room"", section on 'COVID-19'.)●We use low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) targeting ≤6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) (range 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW (table 3 and table 4)) that targets a plateau pressure ≤30 cm H2O and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table (table 5). For patients with COVID-19 who fail LTVV, prone ventilation is the preferred next step (table 7 and table 6). (See 'Ventilator management of acute respiratory distress syndrome' above and ""Ventilator management strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"" and ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults"".) ●Several procedures, including the collection of respiratory specimens, bronchoscopy, extubation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are aerosol-generating and should be avoided or minimized, if possible. All procedures should be grouped when possible. (See 'Interventions' above.)●Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are mechanically ventilated for ARDS should receive the usual daily surveillance, and supportive care including conservative fluid management (unless patients have sepsis or volume depletion) (table 1). Measurement of surveillance cardiac troponins and a low threshold to perform transthoracic echocardiography is appropriate for the early detection of cardiac injury. (See 'Supportive care' above and 'Monitoring for complications' above.) •In critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS who do not have a specific indication (eg, acute bronchospasm or refractory septic shock), we suggest not administering glucocorticoids (Grade 2C). The rationale for not administering glucocorticoids in this population is that the data supporting any benefit in the non-COVD-19 population did not include a sufficient proportion of patients with viral pneumonia to inform safety and that data in patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], influenza) suggested harm. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Glucocorticoids'.) •For acute bronchodilation, we prefer the use of in-line metered dose inhalers (MDIs) rather than administration via a standard jet or vibrating mesh nebulizer due to the lower risk of aerosolization associated with MDIs. Individual institutions should work with their pharmacy regarding compassionate use of investigational medications and trial enrollment. We suggest the development of protocols by individual ICUs for the off-label use of investigational agents. (See 'Nebulized medication' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)●For patients with COVID-19 who develop ARDS, the prognosis is poor with mortality ranging from 52 to 67 percent. The highest rates of death occur in those ≥64 years. (See 'Prognosis' above.)●A greater level of anxiety and trauma among patients and families should be anticipated and combatted with clear communication strategies and early palliative care involvement. Precautions should continue if the patient continues to test positive for COVID-19 before discharge to a long term acute care facility. (See 'End of life issues' above and 'Discharge and long term care' above.)●Several measures should be adopted to accommodate a surge in COVID-19 cases including included expanding ICU care into non-ICU spaces, utilizing non-critical care trained staff to participate in delivering critical care, and innovative approaches to obtain, conserve, and increase the efficiency of physical equipment (eg, personal protective equipment and mechanical ventilators). (See 'Surge capacity and scarce resource allocation' above.)",2020-05-22 02:00:00,UPTODATE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
ID:127535,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues,"INTRODUCTION — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Information about COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, and interim guidance by multiple organizations is constantly being updated and expanded. This topic will discuss issues related to COVID-19 during pregnancy and delivery.VIROLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY — General issues regarding the virology, geographic distribution, route of transmission, period of infectivity, and immunity of SARS-CoV-2 are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)Vertical transmission is addressed below. (See 'Vertical transmission' below.)PREVENTION — Pregnant women should follow the same recommendations as nonpregnant persons for avoiding exposure to the virus (eg, social distancing, hand hygiene, disinfecting surfaces, wearing a mask in public). Women with epidemiologic history of contact should be monitored. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Personal preventive measures'.)Pregnant women with children should exercise caution. COVID-19 in children is often mild and may be asymptomatic, although severe cases have been reported. Given the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or presymptomatic individuals within the incubation period) [1-7], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that children not have playdates with children from other households; that they remain ≥6 feet from people from other households when playing outside; and that they wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain [8]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"", section on 'Should play dates and playgrounds be avoided?'.) Pregnant health care workers have additional concerns, and there is no standard occupational guidance for them regarding work restrictions [9,10].Pregnant workers in occupations other than health care may continue to work until they deliver, but risk mitigation (reassignment at term to roles with reduced risk of exposure or self-quarantine) can be considered to reduce the individual's risk of being infected peripartum, when maternal infection has broader implications (eg, exposure of health care workers, infant exposure) [9]. The patient's comorbidities and individual work situation should guide the clinician's response to requests for medical leave.CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS — All pregnant women should be monitored for development of symptoms and signs of COVID-19, particularly if they have had close contact with a confirmed case or persons under investigation. In a systematic review including 356 cases in pregnant women (33 studies), the most frequent symptoms were fever (67 percent), cough (66 percent), dyspnea (7 percent), sore throat (7 percent), fatigue (7 percent), and myalgia (6 percent) [11]. Rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, headache, and possibly abnormalities in smell and/or taste have also been reported. Laboratory findings included lymphopenia (14 percent), modest increase in liver enzymes (5 percent), and thrombocytopenia (1 percent) [11]. These clinical manifestations are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)Complications of infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shock. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)Classification of disease severity — In the United States, the National Institutes of Health have categorized disease severity as [12]:●Asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection – Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 but no symptoms.●Mild illness – Any signs and symptoms (eg, fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain) without shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging.●Moderate illness – Evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) >93 percent on room air at sea level.●Severe illness – Respiratory frequency >30 breaths per minute, SaO2 ≤93 percent on room air at sea level, ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300, or lung infiltrates >50 percent.●Critical illness – Respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.Disease severity has also been categorized as (Wu classification) [13]:●Mild – No or mild symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough, and/or less common features of COVID-19).●Severe – Tachypnea (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute), hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤93 percent on room air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg), or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging).●Critical (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Defining disease severity'.)COURSE IN PREGNANCYMaternal course — Available data from multiple small series and case reports generally suggest that pregnancy and childbirth do not increase the risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, do not worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 compared with nonpregnant individuals of the same age, and most infected mothers recover without undergoing delivery [13-28]. The population most commonly affected by severe disease is older adults, particularly those with comorbidities, and most pregnant women are younger than middle age; however, they may have comorbid conditions that increase their risk (eg, obesity). It is known that some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response (similar to cytokine release syndrome), which has been associated with critical and fatal illnesses. Whether the normal immunologic changes of pregnancy affect the occurrence and course of this response is unknown. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications'.)In pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia, early data show approximately the same rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions as in the nonpregnant population but an increased risk of preterm and cesarean delivery. (See 'Pregnancy complications' below.)●In a systematic review including 295 pregnant patients, 4.7 percent were admitted to an ICU [27]. ●In an initial United States experience from New York City including 43 pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19, the disease course was mild in 37 (86 percent), severe in 4 (9.3 percent), and critical in 2 (4.7 percent) [14]. ●In a larger cohort of 147 pregnant patients in the WHO-China Joint Mission Report and a separate report of 118 pregnant patients in Wuhan, the illness was severe in 8 percent and critical in 1 percent [17]. These percentages are similar to those of nonpregnant, reproductive-age adults [13,29].Severe sequelae of maternal infection include prolonged ventilatory support and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [30,31].Several maternal deaths from cardiopulmonary complications, sometimes with multiorgan failure, have been reported in the medical literature [32-34]. Most of these women were generally healthy prior to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.It is important to note that in one report from New York City, 10 of 14 patients (71 percent) who were asymptomatic on admission for an obstetric indication and found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive on universal screening went on to develop symptoms during their delivery admission or postpartum [14]. Of the 14 initially asymptomatic patients, 4 remained asymptomatic, 8 developed mild symptoms, and 2 developed severe/critical disease.While the course of the infection in pregnant persons is similar to that in nonpregnant persons, there are added issues during pregnancy, such as timing of prenatal care visits and screening tests in uninfected women and, in infected women, potential pregnancy complications, timing and management of labor and delivery, and postpartum care (mother-newborn separation, breastfeeding, infant care, postpartum depression risk). These issues are reviewed below.Pregnancy complications — Preterm birth and cesarean delivery rates are increased. A systematic review including 252 pregnant COVID-19 patients reported that 15 percent delivered before 37 weeks and 70 percent were delivered by cesarean [11]. It is important to emphasize that available data are generally of low quality, reflecting small numbers of cases and a disproportionate number of patients intubated with COVID-19 pneumonia. Fever and hypoxemia from severe pneumonia may increase the risks for preterm labor, prelabor rupture of membranes, and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, but preterm deliveries also occurred in patients without severe respiratory disease. It appears that many of the initial third-trimester cases were electively delivered by cesarean because of a bias to intervene catalyzed by the belief that management of severe maternal respiratory disease would be improved by delivery; however, this hypothesis is unproven.The frequency of spontaneous abortion does not appear to be increased, but data on first-trimester infections are limited [11,27,35]. At least five critically ill women had fetal deaths: four of these women died, and the other was on ECMO [30,32,33]. Over 95 percent of newborns have been in good condition at birth; neonatal complications have largely been related to preterm birth and to adverse uterine environments resulting from critical maternal disease [11,33,36].Hyperthermia, which is common in COVID-19, is a theoretical concern as elevation of maternal core temperature from a febrile illness during organogenesis in the first trimester may be associated with an increased risk of congenital anomalies, especially neural tube defects, or miscarriage; however, an increased incidence of these outcomes has not been observed. Use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, including in the first trimester, has been shown overall to be safe and may attenuate the pregnancy risks associated with fever exposure. (See ""Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management"", section on 'Fever/hyperthermia'.)Vertical transmission — Vertical transmission had not been proven, but the possibility of transmission cannot be excluded. Standards for neonatal evaluation at delivery of an infected mother and criteria for vertical transmission have not been developed. Assessing the immunoglobulin M (IgM) level for the virus in cord blood and sampling the neonatal nasopharynx, amnion-chorion interface, and placental tissue using aseptic technique immediately after delivery have been suggested. Amniotic fluid obtained at cesarean delivery could also be tested.In women who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx, vaginal and amniotic fluid specimens have been negative to date [35,37,38]. Viremia rates in patients with COVID-19 appear to be low (1 percent in one study [39]) and transient, suggesting placental seeding and vertical transmission are unlikely. Few placentas have been studied, and almost all had no evidence of infection. One exception is a case report of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 who had second-trimester miscarriage in which samples taken from a placental cotyledon and submembrane were positive for SARS-CoV-2; all fetal, amniotic fluid, cord blood, and maternal blood and vaginal samples were negative [40]. Another report described one positive placental swab from the amniotic surface and two positive membrane swabs from between the amnion and chorion after manual separation of the membranes in women with severe or critical COVID-19 illness delivered by cesarean; none of the infants were positive for SARS-CoV-2 [41].The extent and clinical significance of vertical transmission remain unclear. A few possible cases of vertical transmission based on newborn laboratory and/or clinical findings have been reported [20,42-45], but SARS-CoV-2 testing on fetal blood, amniotic fluid, and placenta was either negative or not performed. Many of these infants were delivered by cesarean and had positive nasopharyngeal cultures for SARS-CoV-2 on days 1 or 2 of life, an elevated IgM level, and/or pneumonia. Positive IgM results are not definitive evidence of in utero infection (false positives and cross reactivity occur), and, in many of these cases, early infant infection may have been due to postnatal contact with infected parents or caregivers [46].APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS — The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered in patients with new-onset fever/chills and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea). It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Residing in or travel to a location where there is community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the past 14 days should heighten suspicion. Patients who meet the testing criteria should undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen, ideally in addition to testing for other respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus). Criteria for testing and diagnostic issues are discussed in detail separately (see ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'). In areas where the infection is active, we believe testing all patients upon presentation to labor and delivery (or the day before if a scheduled admission) with a rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 is reasonable, if testing is available. (See 'Infection control precautions' below.) This testing should occur in a location designed to reduce the risk of passing the infection to uninfected persons, such as at dedicated ""walk-in"" or ""drive-in"" testing locations from which results can be made readily available to the obstetric providers. A positive RT-PCR generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although occasional false-positive tests occur [47]. False-negative tests on initial testing appear to be common, especially in the four days preceding symptoms and the first day of symptoms [48], and have been reported in pregnant women [49]. Sensitivity depends on several factors: the specific RT-PCR assay, the type of specimen obtained (nasopharyngeal specimens have higher sensitivity than oropharyngeal or nasal specimens), the quality of the specimen, and the duration of illness at the time of testing [47]. If the initial nasopharyngeal test is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains and determining the presence of infection is important for management or infection control, the test should be repeated in 24 hours to a few days. Infection control precautions for COVID-19 should continue while repeat evaluation is being performed. Two subsequent negative samples generally rule out the infection [50]. If there is high suspicion of COVID-19 infection and diagnosis is required for management, lower respiratory tract specimens (eg, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) can be tested as they have higher sensitivity [51]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Laboratory findings'.)A chest radiograph is sufficient for initial evaluation of pulmonary complications in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A single chest radiograph carries a very low fetal radiation dose of 0.0005 to 0.01 mGy. Computed tomography (CT) should be performed, if indicated, as the fetal radiation dose for a routine chest CT (table 1) is also low and not associated with an increased risk of fetal anomalies or pregnancy loss. Some authorities have advocated pulmonary ultrasound, possibly at the same time as the obstetric scan, for quick diagnosis of pneumonia in pregnant women, which in certain locations would be the quickest way to ascertain high suspicion of maternal COVID-19 infection [52,53]. A detailed description of performance of lung ultrasound can be found elsewhere [52]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Evaluation' and ""Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and nursing women"".)PRENATAL CAREPreventing exposure in the community — Social distancing and hygienic measures are recommended but may be difficult for pregnant women who are homeless, living in a shelter, living in multigenerational dense housing, or living in multiple places in a short time. Social distancing and hygienic measures are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Personal preventive measures'.)Patients with potential exposure — Pregnant patients with an epidemiologic history of contact with a person with confirmed, probable, or suspected COVID-19 should self-isolate and be monitored for symptoms. The incubation period is up to 14 days. Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on test availability. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Managing asymptomatic individuals with potential exposure'.)Further evaluation and management of patients who become symptomatic depend on illness severity, underlying comorbidities, and clinical status. Those with at least moderate illness are typically hospitalized. These issues and timing of discontinuation of precautions are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Routine prenatal care in uninfected women — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine have issued guidance regarding prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic (available at acog.org and SMFM.org) [54,55]. It includes general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19, algorithms, and suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits. These modifications, which should be tailored for low- versus high-risk patients (eg, multiple gestation, hypertension, diabetes), include telehealth, reducing the number of in-person visits, timing of visits, grouping tests (eg, aneuploidy, diabetes, infection screening) to minimize maternal contact with others, restricting visitors during visits and tests, timing of indicated obstetric ultrasound examinations (eg, gestational age, fetal anomaly, fetal growth, placental attachment), and timing and frequency of use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles. There are many ways to reduce the time patients, including patients with high-risk pregnancies, are in the office [56]. For example, the clinician can order a 75 gram two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) instead of a glucose challenge test and 100 gram three-hour GTT (in women with positive results); cell-free DNA screening can be used (at >10 weeks) for Down syndrome screening rather than the combined test (ie, nuchal translucency on ultrasound and serum analytes). Ideally, every woman should have telehealth capabilities and a means for measuring blood pressure at home. In the author's practice, during the pandemic, most low-risk pregnant women come to the office only for in-person prenatal visits at approximately 12, 20, 28, and 36 weeks of gestation (ie, at gestational ages when ultrasound and/or laboratory tests can also be performed) to minimize person-to-person contacts. Some practices are encouraging that even these visits occur by telehealth, and others include a visit at approximately 32 weeks [50]. When an outpatient office visit occurs, all patients and health care workers wear at least a surgical mask; no partner is allowed, but video communication is encouraged.The psychological impact of COVID-19 should also be recognized and support offered. In one study, approximately one-third of respondents reported moderate to severe anxiety [57].Medical management of pregnant women with COVID-19Home care — Most pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19 have mild disease (no shortness of breath) that does not warrant hospital-level care in the absence of obstetric problems (eg, preterm labor). Patient instructions and other aspects of home care are similar to that in nonpregnant persons, except pregnant women in the third trimester should perform fetal kick counts and report decreased fetal movement [50]. Patients experiencing homelessness should be provided resources such as dedicated housing units, where available. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting' and ""Decreased fetal movement: Diagnosis, evaluation, and management"".) The US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its approval for use of noninvasive fetal and maternal monitoring devices in the home in patients who require fetal and/or maternal monitoring for conditions unrelated to COVID-19 [58]. This can help reduce patient and health care provider contact and potential exposure to COVID-19 during the pandemic.Medical and obstetric care of hospitalized patients — Pregnant women with mild disease plus comorbidities or moderate to critical disease are hospitalized. Pregnant hospitalized patients with severe disease, an oxygen requirement plus comorbidities, or critical disease should be cared for by a multispecialty team at a level III or IV hospital with obstetric services and an adult intensive care unit (ICU) [9,50]. COVID-19 status alone is not necessarily a reason to transfer noncritically ill pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. (See 'Classification of disease severity' above.)Guidelines for management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, including evaluation and care of critically ill patients, are reviewed elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Fetal monitoring — A specific management issue in pregnant patients is fetal monitoring in those who are at a viable gestational age. The need for and frequency of fetal testing depend upon gestational age, stability of maternal vital signs, other maternal comorbidities, and discussions with the patient and her family that consider the possibly increased risks of stillbirth and perinatal morbidities in the absence of testing. For hospitalized patients, a Bluetooth-enabled external fetal monitor can transmit the fetal heart rate tracing to the obstetric provider. The monitor can be used continuously in unstable hospitalized patients in whom emergency cesarean delivery would be performed for a persistent nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. An abnormal tracing might also help guide maternal oxygen therapy. In patients with stable oxygen saturation (SaO2), a nonstress test can be performed once or twice daily, as one option. Monitoring for preterm labor — Monitoring pregnant patients for signs and symptoms of preterm labor is a routine component of obstetric care and should be a component of maternal monitoring of pregnant patients hospitalized in nonobstetric settings. (See ""Preterm labor: Clinical findings, diagnostic evaluation, and initial treatment"".)Maternal oxygenation level — Among critically ill COVID-19 patients, profound acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the dominant finding. General supportive care of the critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is similar to that in patients with ARDS due to other causes. Common complications of COVID-19-related ARDS include acute kidney injury, elevated liver enzymes, and cardiac injury (eg, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death). During pregnancy, maternal peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) should be maintained at ≥95 percent, which is in excess of the oxygen delivery needs of the mother. If SpO2 falls below 95 percent, an arterial blood gas is obtained to measure the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): Maternal PaO2 greater than 70 mmHg is desirable to maintain a favorable oxygen diffusion gradient from the maternal to the fetal side of the placenta.In the ICU, severely ill patients with COVID-19 are often managed in the prone position. Some ICUs have extended this approach to pregnant women, although even a semi-prone position can be a difficult position in which to place a pregnant woman in the last half of pregnancy. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"" and ""Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period"", section on 'Supportive care' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)Use and type of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis — Direct data on thromboembolic risk with COVID-19 are limited but suggest an increased risk. The American Society of Hematology, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, and the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis [59-61] recommend routine pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 unless there is a contraindication (eg, bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia). We initiate prophylaxis in all pregnant/postpartum women with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital for management of an antepartum or postpartum obstetric or medical disorder or because of the severity of COVID-19 alone. For antepartum prophylaxis in women who are not severely or critically ill and who may deliver within a few days, unfractionated heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 12 hours is a reasonable dose. Dosing in other inpatient clinical scenarios is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and 'Postpartum care' below.)Unfractionated heparin is generally preferred in pregnant women who might be proximate to delivery because it is more readily reversed than low molecular weight heparin. Low molecular weight heparin is reasonable in women unlikely to be delivered within several days and those who are postpartum. Dosing is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)Safety of antiviral drug therapy — Several agents are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Although some of these agents are clinically available for other indications, their use for COVID-19 remains investigational. ●Remdesivir – At some hospitals, pregnant women with severe COVID-19 are being offered remdesivir in a compassionate-use protocol. Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [62] and related coronaviruses (including severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) both in vitro and in animal studies [63]. It has been used without reported fetal toxicity in some pregnant women with Ebola and Marburg virus disease [64] and is being used to treat, on a compassionate-use basis, pregnant patients with severe COVID-19. Randomized trials of the drug during the COVID-19 pandemic have excluded pregnant and breastfeeding women. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)●Other drugs – Data from early randomized trials generally suggest no benefit from administration of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Furthermore, adverse maternal effects include abnormal heart rhythms (QT interval prolongation and ventricular tachycardia), especially in patients taking other drugs associated with QTc prolongation. Therefore, these drugs should not be used for treatment of COVID-19 outside of ongoing randomized trials. Hydroxychloroquine crosses the placenta. Accumulation in fetal ocular tissue has been observed in animal studies, but an increased risk of fetal ocular abnormalities has not been observed in humans, which is reassuring given that the drug has been used by pregnant women for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus or for prevention of malaria. Available data are limited, however, and a risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out when used at different doses for other indications [65]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine' and ""Malaria in pregnancy: Prevention and treatment"", section on 'Safety of antimalarials in pregnancy' and ""Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus"", section on 'Medications'.)Several other drugs are being used in research studies. One such drug is lopinavir-ritonavir, which is primarily used for treatment of HIV infection, including during pregnancy. It crosses the placenta and may increase the risk for preterm delivery, but an increased risk of teratogenic effects has not been observed in humans. Investigational drugs for COVID-19 that are known to be teratogenic include ribavirin and baricitinib. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications●Antenatal betamethasone – For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because they have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with MERS-CoV infection. However, the CDC has not addressed use of antenatal glucocorticoids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from preterm birth in pregnant COVID-19-positive patients.Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at high risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 [66]. However, for pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation and at risk of preterm birth within seven days, the benefits to the neonate are less clear, and ACOG has advised not administering a course of betamethasone to such patients. However, these decisions may need to be individualized, weighing the neonatal benefits with the risks of potential harm to the pregnant patient. (See ""Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery"", section on 'Gestational age at administration'.)●Low-dose aspirin – For pregnant women without COVID-19, ACOG has stated that low-dose aspirin should continue to be offered as medically indicated (eg, prevention of preeclampsia) [67]. For those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for whom low-dose aspirin would be indicated, the decision to continue the drug should be individualized. For example, continuing preeclampsia prophylaxis is likely not worthwhile in severely or critically ill patients or near term. A panel from the National Institutes of Health has stated that persons with COVID-19 who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for a comorbid condition should continue therapy as previously directed by their health care provider [12].Concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [68,69]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients when clinically indicated [70,71]. ●Tocolysis – In women with known or suspected COVID-19, our preferred tocolytic is nifedipine. It is a suitable alterative to indomethacin, which is subject to the concerns discussed above, and to beta sympathomimetics, which can further increase the maternal heart rate. Follow-up of women who recover from COVID-19 — Development of fetal growth restriction is a theoretic concern and has been described with other SARS infections [72,73]. In the absence of robust data, authorities have suggested that pregnant women with confirmed infection should be monitored with serial ultrasound assessments of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume [74] beginning 14 days after symptom resolution [75]. For those with first- or early second-trimester infection, a detailed fetal morphology scan at 18 to 23 weeks of gestation is also indicated. Very limited COVID-19-specific data on fetal growth are available [18]. Suboptimal fetal growth due to placental insufficiency is plausible because maternal COVID-19 has been associated with focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels in the chorionic plate and stem villi [76]. These lesions could be caused by COVID-19-related coagulopathy or placental hypoxia during the acute maternal illness, or both. Timing delivery in infected women — For most women with preterm COVID-19 and nonsevere illness who have no medical/obstetric indications for prompt delivery, delivery is not indicated and ideally will occur sometime after a negative testing result is obtained or isolation status is lifted, thereby minimizing the risk of postnatal transmission to the neonate [77].In women with severe illness, there are multiple issues to consider, and timing of delivery needs to be individualized [50,78]. Whether the mother's respiratory disease will be improved by delivery and the risk of postnatal transmission in the delivery room when maternal symptoms are acute are both unclear. It should also be noted that maternal antibody production and, in turn, passive newborn immunity may not have had time to develop. On the other hand, increased oxygen consumption and reduced functional residual capacity, which are normal in pregnancy, may facilitate maternal deterioration in patients with pneumonia [79]. Excessive uterine distension from multiple gestation or severe polyhydramnios in the third trimester may further compromise pulmonary function.For the hospitalized patient with COVID-19 with pneumonia but not intubated, some authorities have advocated consideration of delivery in pregnancies >32 to 34 weeks. The rationale is that delivery is performed before the pulmonary situation worsens and ongoing maternal hypoxemia places the fetus at risk of compromise. Most authorities do not advocate delivery prior to 32 weeks, even though the maternal situation may worsen in the second week, given the known morbidity and mortality of very preterm infants.Timing of delivery of the hospitalized pregnant woman intubated and critically ill with COVID-19 is challenging. After 32 to 34 weeks, some have advocated delivery if the patient is stable, but this could exacerbate the maternal condition. Between viability and <32 weeks, continuing maternal support with fetal monitoring is usually suggested for perinatal benefit as long as the maternal situation remains stable or improving. In some situations, maternal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be necessary [80]. MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND DELIVERY — Although many asymptomatic patients are concerned about leaving their home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) continues to recommend following existing evidence-based guidance regarding home birth [67]. (See ""Planned home birth"".)Infection control precautions●Prehospital notification of possible infection – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that pregnant patients who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 notify the obstetric unit before arrival so that the facility can make appropriate infection control preparations [81]. The obstetric unit should ensure that their infection control practices for these patients are consistent with CDC guidelines. ●Evaluation of all patients presenting to the hospital – All patients should be screened for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as whether they have had close contact with a confirmed case or persons under investigation, before entering the hospital for admission to the labor and delivery unit [82]. Screening can include checking temperature and asking about fever and/or new cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle aches, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, and smell and taste abnormalities. The CDC advises prioritizing the testing of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 at admission or who develop symptoms of COVID-19 during admission [81]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)Asymptomatic patients and presymptomatic patients may present to the labor and delivery unit, which has implications for the health care staff and management of the newborn. For this reason, in areas where infection in the community is widespread, we believe testing all patients upon presentation to labor and delivery (or the day before if a scheduled admission) with a rapid SARS-CoV-2 test is reasonable, if testing is available. We believe this information is useful to inform infection control precautions both intrapartum and postpartum, including newborn care [14,83,84]. During the New York City pandemic, 215 pregnant women admitted to two New York City hospitals for delivery were screened for COVID-19, and 33 (15 percent) were SARS-CoV-2-positive [21]. Of the 33 women, 4 were symptomatic and 29 were asymptomatic; thus, 13.5 percent of asymptomatic patients admitted for delivery tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the asymptomatic women who tested positive, 3/29 developed a postpartum fever, and at least one of these patients was presumed to have COVID-19. One additional patient who tested negative on admission became symptomatic postpartum, and repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing was positive. However, these findings are likely not generalizable to areas where the prevalence of COVID-19 is low.The evaluation and diagnosis of women admitted to labor and delivery with suspected COVID-19 are similar to that of other patients admitted to the hospital with suspected disease. The CDC advises prioritizing the testing of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 at admission or who develop symptoms of COVID-19 during admission [81]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)●Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) on labor and delivery – Health care workers should use appropriate PPE when caring for patients with COVID-19. In addition, all patients and any visitors should be given face coverings upon entry into the health care setting (medical or cloth masks) for universal source control. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)During active labor, in particular, there are concerns of viral dissemination when the patient is forcefully exhaling [85]. Forceful exhalation may reduce the effectiveness of a mask for containing respiratory droplets and preventing the spread of the virus. ●Care of COVID-19-positive inpatients – Ideally, pregnant COVID-19 inpatients should be cared for in specially equipped (eg, negative-pressure) rooms in antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum COVID-19-only units, similar to other adult COVID-19 inpatients who are usually placed in dedicated COVID-19-only units, halls, or hospitals. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are normally instructed to wear a face mask, including during labor and delivery, which may be difficult during active pushing [85]. Infection control precautions regarding pregnant patients with confirmed or suspected infection are similar to those for other hospitalized patients and are reviewed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)●Support persons on labor and delivery – Perhaps the most controversial issue regarding infection control for women in labor and delivery units is whether to allow a support person. Most facilities recognize that a support person is important to many laboring women and permit one support person who must remain with the laboring woman (may not leave her room and then return). A doula is considered a type of health care personnel by some facilities and a visitor by others. (See ""Continuous labor support by a doula"".)The support person should be screened for fever and other symptoms before entering the building and in accordance with hospital policies. Those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. If screening is negative, we require that the support person wear a cloth face covering, at a minimum, consistent with CDC guidance [82]. If the support person arrives at the health care facility without a cloth face covering, a face mask should be issued if supplies are available.A support person who screens positive should not be permitted in the hospital. In such cases and when additional support persons are desired, they can be a part of the patient's labor and delivery via video. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Measures for all patients, visitors, and personnel'.)Route of delivery — COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery [16,54]. Cesarean delivery is performed for standard obstetric indications. Even if vertical transmission is confirmed as additional data are reported, this would not be an indication for cesarean delivery since it would increase maternal risk and would be unlikely to improve newborn outcome. Reports of COVID-19 infection in the neonate have generally described mild disease. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)Screening patients scheduled for induction or cesarean delivery — Patients should be screened for COVID-19 and can undergo pre-induction/pre-cesarean laboratory testing the day before a planned induction or cesarean delivery. We evaluate symptomatic patients to determine whether it is feasible to reschedule until results of COVID-19 testing are available. This requires balancing the risks of continuing the pregnancy in the setting of a positive or negative test result. In particular, if the result is positive, the patient may become more severely ill over time since symptoms are often more severe in the second week of the illness.In asymptomatic women, inductions of labor and cesarean deliveries with appropriate medical indications should not be postponed or rescheduled; this includes 39-week inductions or cesarean deliveries after patient counseling. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Course and complications'.)Analgesia and anesthesia — In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, neuraxial anesthetic is not contraindicated and has several advantages in laboring patients: it provides good analgesia and thus reduces cardiopulmonary stress from pain and anxiety and, in turn, the chance of viral dissemination, and it is available in case an emergency cesarean is required, thus obviating the need for general anesthesia. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology suggests considering suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in these patients because of insufficient data about cleaning, filtering, and potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems [86]. They also urge consideration of limiting use of intravenous, patient-controlled analgesia because of the risk of respiratory depression. General anesthesia (intubation and extubation) is considered an aerosolizing procedure, so special PPE (ie, N-95 masks, etc) should be worn by all involved health care providers during such a cesarean delivery. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)Magnesium sulfate — In women with respiratory compromise, the use of magnesium sulfate for maternal seizure prophylaxis and/or neonatal neuroprotection should be decided on a case-by-case basis since the drug may further depress respirations. Consultation with maternal-fetal medicine and pulmonary/critical care specialists is advised.Labor management — Generally, management of labor is not altered in women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic or in women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 that is asymptomatic or mild [85]. Person-to-person contact and time in the labor unit and hospital should be limited, as safely feasible. For patients who require cervical ripening, outpatient mechanical ripening with a balloon catheter is an option. For inpatient cervical ripening, using two methods (eg, mechanical and misoprostol or mechanical and oxytocin) decreases the time from induction to delivery, compared with using one agent only. (See ""Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction"", section on 'Outpatient cervical ripening' and ""Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction"", section on 'Balloon catheter combined with prostaglandins'.)Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended in women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; an increased frequency of nonreassuring tracings has been reported, but these case series typically had a high proportion of women with pneumonia. Intake and output of fluids should be carefully monitored in these women, and aggressive hydration should be avoided since it can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen maternal oxygenation that may already be compromised [79]. In nonpregnant patients with severe COVID-19, conservative fluid management is recommended, as long as hypotension and organ hypoperfusion can be avoided. (See ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults"", section on 'Fluid management'.)SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in vaginal secretions or amniotic fluid, so rupture of fetal membranes and internal fetal heart rate monitoring may be performed for usual indications, but data are limited [19]. It should be noted that labor, and particularly pushing, often causes loss of feces, which can contain the virus and spread the infection [39,87].We believe that use of interventions that can increase risk of infection and have not been proven beneficial, for example the use of the birth ball or peanut ball, should be limited. As intrapartum oxygen has no proven fetal benefit, the practice of oxygen therapy for fetal resuscitation should be abandoned; the nasal cannula and face mask used are in contact with the maternal respiratory tract and secretions, so handling of such equipment increases contamination/exposure between patient and provider. Lastly, we advocate not delaying pushing in the second stage, although others have suggested minimizing the duration of active pushing because deep breathing and maternal expulsive efforts may increase exposure to the patient's respiratory secretions [79]. (See ""Intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings: Management"", section on 'In utero resuscitation' and ""Nonpharmacologic approaches to management of labor pain"", section on 'Birth ball' and ""Management of normal labor and delivery"", section on 'Pushing position and technique'.)Delivery procedures — For women with known or suspected infection, ACOG has stated that delayed umbilical cord clamping is highly unlikely to increase the risk of transmitting pathogens from an infected mother to the fetus [54]; however, some institutions have chosen to prohibit this practice in term infants, in whom the benefits are modest, to minimize newborn exposure to any virus in the immediate environment and reduce the chances that the newborn will require phototherapy for jaundice. Some institutions also prohibit skin-to-skin contact in these cases [88], although the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics has not advised against this [16,89]. One expert group suggested leaving the vernix caseosa in place for 24 hours after birth since it contains antimicrobial peptides [90], whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics advised bathing newborns as soon as reasonably possible after birth to remove virus potentially present on skin surfaces [91].Umbilical cord blood banking can be performed if planned; the risk of COVID-19 transmission by blood products has not been documented and is unclear at present [54].Procedures for testing for vertical transmission are described above. (See 'Vertical transmission' above.)Intrapartum and postpartum fever — COVID-19 infection should be part of the differential diagnosis of intrapartum and postpartum fever, particularly when accompanied by respiratory symptoms and reduced oxygenation. Such patients should be tested for the virus, along with evaluation for common causes of intrapartum and postpartum infection (eg, chorioamnionitis, endometritis) [14]. (See ""Intrapartum fever"" and ""Postpartum endometritis"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)POSTPARTUM CAREVenous thromboembolism prophylaxis — Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be considered in postpartum women with COVID-19, with the decision based on individual risk assessment. There is wide variation in practice. For patients who did not receive antepartum pharmacologic prophylaxis because of COVID-19, we would not administer postpartum prophylaxis if they remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and have an uncomplicated delivery, with no standard indications for postpartum VTE prophylaxis. For patients who received antepartum prophylaxis because of COVID-19, some authorities recommend discontinuing prophylaxis upon discharge in the absence of ongoing risk factors for VTE (eg, immobilization, recent surgery), whereas others continue prophylaxis for 7 to 14 days (and up to six weeks) in patients who had moderate/severe/critical disease or in those with mild disease and other VTE risk factors [50,79,92]. These issues are discussed in more detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Inpatient VTE prophylaxis' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis' and ""Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum"".)Maternal monitoring●For patients with known or suspected COVID-19 who are asymptomatic, postpartum maternal monitoring is routine. ●For patients with mild illness (see 'Classification of disease severity' above), we check vital signs and monitor intake and output every 4 hours for 24 hours after vaginal delivery and 48 hours after cesarean delivery. ●For patients with moderate illness, we perform continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for the first 24 hours or until improvement in signs and symptoms, whichever takes longer. The type and frequency of follow-up laboratory studies and chest imaging (initial or repeat) are guided by the patient's course. Several institutional protocols are available. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)●For patients with severe or critical illness, very close maternal monitoring and care on the labor and delivery unit or intensive care unit are indicated. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)Infant evaluation — The infants of mothers with COVID-19 are considered COVID-19 suspects, and they should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 [81]. Where testing capacity is available, neonates should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as possible and within the first 24 hours of age using available molecular assays [91]. Repeat testing should be performed at approximately 48 hours of age if the infant is still at the birth facility. Both the throat and nasopharynx should be sampled, but one swab may be used to conserve swabs and polymerase chain reaction testing reagents. A separate rectal swab can be obtained if such testing is available at their center. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)Mother-baby contact — Temporary separation of mothers with known or suspected COVID-19 from their newborns has been proposed to reduce the risk of mother-baby transmission, but may also have adverse consequences [93]. For example, not rooming-in and avoiding skin-to-skin contact can be stressful for mothers; disrupt breastfeeding; and have negative effects on newborn stress, feeding, and bonding.The World Health Organization (WHO) has opined that mothers who have suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 virus infection should be enabled to remain together and practice skin-to-skin contact [16]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise determining whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant on a case-by-case basis, using shared decision making between the mother and the clinical team [81]. Factors to consider include:●The mother's and infant's clinical conditions.●Whether the mother's infection is suspected (no SARS-CoV-2 test result) or confirmed, and the infant's SARS-CoV-2 testing result (separation is not necessary if the infant has a positive test).●The mother's desire to breastfeed.●The facility's ability to accommodate mother-baby separation or colocation.●The mother's ability to maintain separation when she goes home, if she has not met criteria to discontinue temporary separation.●Other risks and benefits of temporary separation of a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant.If mother-baby separation is implemented, the following should be considered:●Infant COVID-19 suspects should be isolated from other healthy infants and cared for according to the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.●If another healthy family member is providing infant care (eg, diapering, bathing, feeding), they should use appropriate personal protective equipment (healthy family members should wear a gown, gloves, face mask, and eye protection).If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, other measures may be utilized to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission and include:●Physical barriers (eg, a curtain between the mother and newborn) can be constructed, and the newborn can be kept in a temperature controlled isolette ≥6 feet away from the mother.●The mother can wear a face mask and practice hand hygiene when in close contact with her infant, particularly when feeding.●If another healthy adult is in the room, they can care for the newborn.After hospital discharge — After hospital discharge [91,94]:●A mother with symptomatic COVID-19 infection should maintain a distance of at least six feet from the newborn and use a face mask and hand hygiene for newborn care until (1) at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications plus improvement in respiratory symptoms [cough, shortness of breath]) and (2) at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.●For mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have never been symptomatic, transmission precautions can be discontinued when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test.These are symptom- and time-based strategies for discontinuing transmission precautions. Test-based strategies also exist and are discussed in detail separately. A disadvantage of test-based strategies is that a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result reflects presence of viral RNA but does not necessarily mean that viable virus is present and can be transmitted [47]. Data regarding postinfection risk of transmission and personal immunity are limited [95]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk of transmission' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)Breastfeeding and formula feeding — The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from ingestion of breast milk is unclear. Although several small series reported that all samples of breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 tested negative [11,96], other investigators subsequently reported identifying samples of breast milk positive for the virus [97,98]. More data are needed to assess any potential risk of viral transmission from ingesting breast milk.There is general consensus that breastfeeding should be encouraged because of its many maternal and infant benefits. In the setting of maternal COVID-19 infection, the infant may receive passive antibody protection from the virus since breast milk is a source of antibodies and other anti-infective factors. (See ""Infant benefits of breastfeeding"" and ""Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding"".)If mother and baby separation has been implemented, ideally, the infant is fed expressed breast milk by another healthy caregiver until the mother has recovered or has been proven uninfected, provided that the other caregiver is healthy and follows hygiene precautions [81]. Expressing breast milk is important to support establishment of the maternal milk supply.Before pumping, ideally with a dedicated breast pump, the mother should wear a mask and thoroughly clean her hands and breasts with soap and water and clean pump parts, bottles, and artificial nipples [99]. The CDC has issued guidance about cleaning breast pumps and breastfeeding. If possible, the pumping equipment should be thoroughly cleaned by a healthy person. If feeding by a healthy caregiver is not possible, mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or symptomatic mothers with suspected COVID-19 should take precautions to prevent transmission to the infant during breastfeeding (wear a mask, hand and breast hygiene, disinfect shared surfaces that the symptomatic mother has contacted). However, it should be noted that the value of precautions, such as cleansing the breast prior to breastfeeding/milk expression or disinfecting external surfaces of milk collection devices (eg, bottles, milk bags) for reducing potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2, has not been formally studied [100].Ideally, women who choose to formula feed should have another healthy caregiver feed the infant. If this is not possible or desired, such women must also take appropriate infection control precautions, as described above, to prevent transmission through close contact when feeding.Analgesia — Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for treatment of postpartum pain. As discussed above, concern about possible negative effects of NSAIDs in patients with COVID-19 was raised by anecdotal reports of a few young, nonpregnant patients who received NSAIDs (ibuprofen) early in the course of infection and experienced severe disease [68,69]. However, there have been no clinical or population-based data that directly address the risk of NSAIDs. Given the absence of data, the European Medicines Agency and WHO do not recommend avoiding NSAIDs when clinically indicated [70,71]. Given the uncertainty, we suggest using acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Permanent and reversible contraception — Permanent contraception (tubal sterilization) does not add significant additional time or risk when performed at an uncomplicated cesarean birth and thus should be performed if planned. Permanent contraception after a vaginal birth is more of an elective procedure, so such decisions should be made on a local level, based upon available resources. If not performed or if a reversible contraceptive method is desired, an alternative form of contraception should be provided (eg, immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) as long as the patient desires one of these methods. This avoids additional outpatient postpartum visits. (See ""Overview of female permanent contraception"" and ""Postpartum permanent contraception: Procedures"" and ""Postpartum contraception: Counseling and methods"".)Discharge from hospital — We suggest early discharge postpartum, such as one day after vaginal delivery and a maximum of two days after cesarean delivery, to limit the patient's personal risk in the hospital environment [85].Candidates for mother-infant separation after discharge and criteria for discontinuation of separation are discussed above. (See 'After hospital discharge' above.)Postpartum office visit — Modifying or reducing postpartum outpatient care is appropriate to reduce the risk of inadvertent exposure. For example, it may be possible to perform early postpartum assessments, including wound and blood pressure checks, with telehealth. A comprehensive postpartum visit may still be important by 12 weeks, especially in patients with comorbidities and in patients who lose insurance coverage at that time.All postpartum patients should still be screened for postpartum depression four to eight weeks after delivery. The most widely used instrument is the self-report, 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (figure 1A-B), which can be completed in less than five minutes [101], but alternatives are available. As discussed above, the psychological impact of COVID-19, which may include moderate to severe anxiety, should also be recognized and support offered. (See ""Postpartum unipolar major depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Assessment'.)PREGNANCY REGISTRIES — Registries are being developed to collect data of how COVID-19 affects pregnancy and newborns. For example:●Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY (PRIORITY) is the official United States registry led by the University of California, San Francisco.●International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP) is another registry led by an international group of investigators.SELECTED RESOURCES — In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued guidance regarding prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care during the COVID-19 pandemic [54,56]. This includes general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19 and suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal visits, obstetric ultrasound examinations, use of nonstress tests and biophysical profiles, planned induction or cesarean delivery, and contact with the infant.●American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists COVID-19 information●Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine●World Health Organization●Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:•Pregnancy and Breastfeeding•Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings●International Society of Infectious Disease in Obstetrics and Gynecology Recommendations Concerning COVID-19 and Pregnancy [50].●A dedicated website (www.pregnancycovid19.com) with several helpful pregnancy-specific links and information, including information for patients.PREGNANCY REGISTRY — Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY (PRIORITY) is a nationwide United States study of pregnant or recently pregnant women who are either under investigation or who have been confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Providers and patients can send information via priority.ucsf.edu.SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Pregnant women should follow the same recommendations as nonpregnant persons for avoiding exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). (See 'Prevention' above.)●Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant women are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals. A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although false-positive and false-negative tests are possible. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical features' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Diagnosis'.)●Pregnancy does not appear to increase susceptibility to infection or worsen the clinical course, and most infected mothers recover without undergoing delivery. However, severe disease necessitating maternal intensive care unit admission and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can occur, and maternal deaths have been reported. (See 'Maternal course' above.) ●Infected women, especially those who develop pneumonia, appear to have an increased frequency of preterm birth and cesarean delivery. These complications are likely related to severe maternal illness as intrauterine infection does not appear to occur, but this is still under investigation. A few possible early newborn infections and one possible placental infection have been reported. (See 'Pregnancy complications' above and 'Vertical transmission' above.)●The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) have issued guidance regarding prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic (available at acog.org and SMFM.org), including general guidance for testing and preventing spread of COVID-19, suggestions for modifying traditional protocols for prenatal and postnatal visits and hospital discharge, and algorithms for assessment and management. These modifications are tailored for low- versus high-risk pregnancies. (See 'Prenatal care' above and 'Discharge from hospital' above and 'Postpartum office visit' above.)●For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend avoiding glucocorticoids in COVID-19-positive persons because of the potential for adverse effects on the course of the disease. Because of the clear benefits of antenatal betamethasone administration between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks of gestation in patients at risk of preterm birth within seven days, ACOG continues to recommend its use for standard indications to pregnant patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. (See 'Use of standard medications for managing pregnancy complications' above.)●For most women with preterm COVID-19 and nonsevere illness who have no medical/obstetric indications for prompt delivery, delivery is not indicated and ideally will occur sometime after a negative testing result is obtained or isolation status is lifted, thereby minimizing the risk of postnatal transmission to the neonate. Severely ill patients at least 32 to 34 weeks of gestation with COVID-19 pneumonia may benefit from early delivery. (See 'Timing delivery in infected women' above.)●In areas where the infection is active, we believe testing all patients upon presentation to labor and delivery (or the day before if a scheduled admission) is reasonable, if testing is available. In a city with a high infection prevalence, a high proportion of asymptomatic patients (13.5 percent in one study) admitted for delivery tested positive, which has clinical implications for triage, staff, and newborn care. (See 'Infection control precautions' above.)●Generally, management of labor is not altered in women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic or in women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in vaginal secretions or amniotic fluid, so rupture of fetal membranes and internal fetal heart rate monitoring may be performed for usual indications, but data are limited. COVID-19 is not an indication to alter the route of delivery. The partner/support person should be screened in accordance with hospital policies and those with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, exposure to a confirmed case within 14 days, or a positive test for COVID-19 within 14 days should not be allowed to attend the labor and birth. (See 'Management of labor and delivery' above.)●In patients with known or suspected COVID-19, neuraxial anesthetic is not contraindicated and has several advantages in laboring patients. The Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology suggests suspending use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia in these patients because of insufficient data about potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide systems. (See 'Analgesia and anesthesia' above.)●At delivery of patients with known or suspected COVID-19, some institutions have chosen to avoid delayed cord clamping in term infants, in whom the benefits are modest, to minimize newborn exposure to any virus in the immediate environment and reduce the chances that the newborn will require phototherapy for jaundice. (See 'Delivery procedures' above.)●Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for treatment of postpartum pain; however, there are anecdotal reports of possible negative effects of NSAIDs in patients with COVID-19. Given the uncertainty, we use acetaminophen as the preferred analgesic agent, if possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose should be used. (See 'Analgesia and anesthesia' above.)●Infants born to mothers with known COVID-19 are COVID-19 suspects and should be tested, isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to infection control precautions for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. (See 'Infant evaluation' above.) ●Whether to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant is determined on a case-by-case basis. If the infant tests positive, separation is unnecessary. If separation is indicated (mother is on transmission-based precautions) but not implemented, other measures may be utilized to reduce potential mother-to-infant transmission, including physical barriers and ≥6 feet separation, personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, and utilization of other healthy adults for infant care (feeding, diapering, bathing). (See 'Mother-baby contact' above.)●The virus has been found in some samples of breast milk, but data are limited and risk of transmission to the infant from ingestion of breast milk is unclear. Droplet transmission to the newborn could occur through close contact during feeding. In mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or symptomatic mothers with suspected COVID-19, to minimize direct contact, ideally, the infant is fed expressed breast milk by another caregiver until the mother has recovered or been proven uninfected, provided that the other caregiver is healthy and follows hygiene precautions. In such cases, the mother should wear a mask and thoroughly clean her hands and breasts before pumping; the pump parts, bottles, and artificial nipples should be cleaned as well. If she breastfeeds the infant directly, similar personal hygienic precautions should be taken. (See 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding' above.)●Several agents are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir is the most promising and has been used without reported fetal toxicity in some severely ill pregnant women. (See 'Safety of antiviral drug therapy' above.)",2020-05-22 02:00:00,UPTODATE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
ID:127759,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults,"INTRODUCTION — At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the infection rapidly spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. The coronavirus is now designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness it causes is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The spectrum of COVID-19 in adults ranges from asymptomatic infection to mild respiratory tract symptoms to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction. Our understanding of the spectrum of disease as well as optimal management strategies continues to evolve.This topic will address the management of adult patients with COVID-19 (presumed and confirmed) in the outpatient setting, including self-care advice, telehealth, outpatient clinic management, and emergency department (ED) referral. It is important to note that there are limited data informing outpatient management strategies, and the approach described here is based upon our clinical experience; clinicians should take into the account the individual patient's clinical and social circumstances as well as the available resources.General management strategies, including infection control measures, care for hospitalized patients, and specific COVID-19 complications, are discussed in detail elsewhere, as are considerations for special populations:●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Anesthetic concerns, including airway management and infection control"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Intensive care ventilation with anesthesia machines"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cancer care during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Psychiatric symptoms and disorders"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to gastrointestinal disease in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Care of patients with systemic rheumatic disease during the pandemic"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)GENERAL PRINCIPLESContinuum of care — When possible, we favor managing all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 within an outpatient continuum of care management program that includes:●Self-assessment tools. (See 'Patient self-assessment tools' below.)●Initial telephone triage. (See 'Initial telephone triage' below.)●Coordinated outreach and management approach based upon individual patient risk, severity of symptoms, and time course of disease. (See 'Risk stratification' below and 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below and 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)●Clinician telehealth (telephone call or video platform-based) visits (initial evaluation and follow-up visits) [1]. (See 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)●COVID-19 testing. (See 'Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing' below.)●A separate outpatient respiratory clinic or dedicated space within an ambulatory clinic appropriated for the care of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory problems. Strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by staff and other patients should be employed [2]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the health care setting'.)In addition, the outpatient clinic should have a close, coordinated relationship with the local emergency department (ED) and function in partnership within the continuum of care program. (See 'Rationale for outpatient management and remote care' below.)●A close working relationship with local public health officials and community leaders.In such a system, patients could enter the ambulatory COVID-19 care program by contacting their primary health care provider or following discharge from the ED or an inpatient hospital stay.In addition, during the course of illness and recovery, patients would be able to transition to different sites of care for follow-up as dictated by clinical need (eg, from home self-care management, to outpatient clinic or ED evaluation, to telehealth follow-up, and back to self-care management).Rationale for outpatient management and remote care — Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients with COVID-19; in approximately 80 percent of patients, illness is mild and does not warrant medical intervention or hospitalization [3]. In addition, remote (telehealth) management is preferred for the majority of patients for the following reasons:●Remote management can prevent unnecessary in-person medical visits, including visits to urgent care facilities and EDs. It thus avoids additional, unnecessary strain on an already overburdened and overwhelmed health care system (including utilization of limited resources, especially personal protective equipment [PPE]).●In-person health care provider visits require the patient to leave their home, traveling via public, private, or emergency transport and potentially exposing others to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, upon arrival at a health care facility, patients may expose other patients and health care workers to the virus.Creating a comprehensive, coordinated outpatient care program that incorporates these components may allow more patients to receive supportive care at home and, if necessary, in the ambulatory clinic setting, further reducing ED and hospital resource utilization.Telehealth has been used for patient management during previous disease outbreaks, including SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza A H1N1 [4]. However, remote evaluation has not been studied in the setting of a global pandemic nor in caring for patients with COVID-19; thus, evidence that demonstrates improved outcomes with home management of COVID-19 is lacking.Telehealth evaluation for COVID-19 during the pandemic can be performed by telephone call, video-based telemedicine platform, or commercial video chat platform; the format chosen should be compliant with applicable patient privacy regulations [5].Flexibility in approach to care — High-quality data supporting the superiority of any single outpatient management strategy are lacking, and treatment protocols are being developed and modified as understanding of the disease evolves.Our approach is based upon our clinical experience of treating patients with COVID-19 and places additional emphasis on avoiding infection transmission, preserving limited resources (including tests and PPE), and reducing the burden on overwhelmed health care systems.The intensity (frequency and duration) of outpatient follow-up will vary according to a patient's risk for developing severe disease (table 1), will vary by institution, region, and resource availability, and will likely change with the burden of disease in a given location. As an example, some institutions have been able to establish dedicated respiratory clinics devoted to managing COVID-19 patients, with available in-person and remote management options; in many other locations, these patients are being managed by primary care clinicians, often in consultation with a team of specially trained clinicians.Additionally, institutions may need to revise protocols, even over a several-week period, in response to surges in the number of patients with suspected infection they are managing [6].INITIAL EVALUATION — Most patients who have concerns about COVID-19, even those with mild symptoms, will likely initiate contact with the health care system. For those patients, self-assessment tools, or remote (telehealth) evaluation are the preferred initial management approaches [7-9].Patient self-assessment tools — Patient education materials, including self-assessment tools, can help patients determine if medical evaluation is necessary, and proactive dissemination of these materials may increase awareness and encourage their use. Various online self-assessment tools published by medical institutions and governmental health agencies can guide patients through questions and suggest when to seek medical care; by following the guidance, many patients with mild illness may be able to recover at home on their own without needing to come in direct contact with a health care provider. Before recommending a specific assessment tool, however, clinicians should vet the options carefully, as they may exceed the abilities of patients with limited health literacy or can become quickly out-of-date based upon rapidly changing guidelines.In one study, use of a self-assessment tool embedded into the electronic health record allowed 40 percent of symptomatic patients to be appropriately triaged to self-care [9]. This study, however, was conducted in the setting of relatively low community prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and might not be representative of settings with widespread community transmission.Initial telephone triage — In addition to self-assessment tools, an initial triage call by clinic staff can often determine which patients are appropriate for self-care at home, which patients warrant a timely clinician telehealth visit (televisit), and which patients warrant an outpatient clinic visit or urgent emergency department (ED) evaluation [10]. (See 'Risk stratification' below.) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)Any patient with symptoms suggestive of respiratory compromise or hypoxia (eg, significant dyspnea at rest or mental confusion) should be referred for urgent in-person evaluation; the appropriate site of care depends upon the severity of symptoms and is discussed elsewhere. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing — During a pandemic, patients who live in regions with widespread community transmission and have compatible symptoms are generally managed presumptively as having COVID-19, even if they have not been tested or have an initial negative test result.Patients with COVID-19 typically first experience a viral-type illness with symptoms ranging from a mild upper respiratory tract infection (eg, pharyngitis, rhinorrhea) to a lower respiratory tract infection (eg, cough, fever), influenza-like symptoms (eg, fever, chills, headache, myalgias), or gastroenteritis (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) (table 2) [11,12]. Loss of smell and taste may also occur, with olfactory loss typically reported early in the course of illness [13]. Dyspnea, if it develops, tends to occur in most patients between four to eight days after the onset of symptoms, although it can occur after 10 days [11]. In patients with less typical symptoms such as isolated rhinorrhea or headache, the likelihood of illness due to COVID-19 should take into account the local prevalence of disease. However, during a pandemic, COVID-19 cannot be ruled out based upon clinical history. Further, even in locations with a high prevalence of COVID-19, the possibility of other etiologies of symptoms should be considered. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Initial presentation' and 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' below.)Availability of testing for SARS-CoV-2 varies widely across regions. If testing capacity and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies allow, we favor widespread use of testing, including drive-through testing, which is important for epidemiologic purposes. However, when resources are limited, SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatients with mild disease may be neither readily available nor appropriate; in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have proposed priorities for testing (table 3). Specific criteria for testing vary by location, institution, and will change over time. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'COVID-19 testing not readily available'.)In patients who are able to undergo testing, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirms COVID-19. However, given sampling variability, viral load variation, and potential false-negative results, a single negative test does not exclude infection and should not guide management [14,15]. Antibody detection has less utility for diagnosis in the acute outpatient setting and should not be used as the sole test to exclude or diagnose COVID-19. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Risk stratification — Our patient-centered continuum of care management approach is based on stratification by risk for developing severe disease and close monitoring for respiratory decompensation. Patients without severe initial symptoms, who are deemed stable enough to not require immediate in-person evaluation, are risk stratified to determine the intensity (frequency and duration) of follow-up.Assess risk for severe disease — Older age and certain chronic medical conditions have been associated with more severe illness and higher mortality with COVID-19 (table 1). We categorize patients as being high, moderate, and low risk for severe disease:●High risk•Age ≥65 years •Residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility•Immunocompromising condition•Chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma•Cardiovascular disease (including hypertension)•Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40 kg/m2)•Diabetes mellitus•Chronic kidney disease (undergoing dialysis)•Cerebrovascular disease•Chronic liver disease•Tobacco use disorder●Moderate risk•Age 20 to 64 years, without any of the specific comorbidities listed above•Age <20 years, with underlying medical conditions other than those listed above●Low risk•Age <20 years, without underlying medical conditionsThese categories are based upon CDC guidance as well as data from published cohort studies, in which older age and many of these underlying conditions were associated with severe disease and death [16-19].Additionally, in the United States, black and Hispanic patients have represented a disproportionately high percentage of hospitalizations and deaths [17,18,20]. The reasons for this finding are unclear but may be related to inequalities in the social determinants of health (eg, access to health care, economic stability, living environment, community experience, education) that predispose to disease. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)It is important to note that although patients who are ≥65 years of age or have poorly controlled chronic medical conditions have a higher risk for hospitalization and death, infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause catastrophic illness in any patient, even among moderate-risk or, less frequently, low-risk patients. In addition, although the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild disease [21,22], infants and children with underlying medical conditions warrant close monitoring; severe disease is most likely to occur in children with underlying medical conditions [23]. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that has been reported in children and adolescents in association with current or recent COVID-19 infection or exposure [24-28]. It shares clinical features with Kawasaki disease (KD), KD shock, and toxic shock syndrome. The evaluation and management of children with COVID-19 exposure and infection are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".) Assess symptom duration and severityTime course and development of dyspnea — For any patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, we establish the illness timeline: the first day symptoms began, the presence of dyspnea, and the day of dyspnea onset. While mild dyspnea is common, worsening dyspnea, particularly dyspnea at rest, and more severe chest discomfort/tightness, are concerning symptoms and suggest the development or progression of pulmonary involvement. The trajectory of dyspnea over the days following its onset is particularly important, as significant worsening and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can manifest soon after the onset of dyspnea; in studies among patients who develop ARDS, progression to ARDS occurred a median of 2.5 days after onset of dyspnea [29-33]. In patients at moderate and high risk for severe illness (table 1), outreach efforts should be focused particularly on the days following the onset of dyspnea to assess for any worsening of respiratory status.It is unclear what percentage of patients with COVID-19 develop dyspnea, as available reports are likely not representative of all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, of patients with symptomatic infection, dyspnea likely develops in only a subgroup of patients. As examples, dyspnea developed in 19 percent of approximately 1000 COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China [34]. However, in a CDC study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the United States, 43 percent of symptomatic adults and 13 percent of symptomatic children developed dyspnea [23]. Among patients who develop dyspnea, it typically begins at least several days after the onset of illness. In one study of 41 hospitalized patients in China, dyspnea developed, on average, eight days after the onset of symptoms [35]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)Dyspnea assessment — Remote assessment of dyspnea should focus on the patient's subjective symptoms, as well as an objective assessment of breathing, including deterioration in respiratory function [36]. We begin by asking if patients have developed any difficulty with their breathing, other than that associated with coughing. If yes, we ask the patient to describe the difficulty in their own words and assess the ease and comfort of their speech (eg, if they can speak comfortably in complete sentences).In addition, we ask questions that provide a more objective assessment of changes in respiratory status, including [36]:●“What activities that you could previously do without difficulty are now causing you to be out of breath?”●""Has this gotten worse over the last one, two, or three days?""●“Are you breathing harder or faster than usual when sitting still?”●“Can you no longer do your usual household activities due to shortness of breath?”●“Does walking cause you to feel dizzy?”We use this assessment to categorize dyspnea by severity:●Mild dyspnea – Dyspnea that does not interfere with daily activities (eg, mild shortness of breath with activities such as climbing one to two flights of stairs or walking briskly).●Moderate dyspnea – Dyspnea that creates limitations to activities of daily living (eg, shortness of breath that limits the ability to walk up one flight of stairs without needing to rest, or interferes with meal preparation and light housekeeping tasks).●Severe dyspnea – Dyspnea that causes shortness of breath at rest, renders the patient unable to speak in complete sentences, and interferes with basic activities such as toileting and dressing.If available, telemedicine consultation with video capability may allow an even better evaluation of respiratory status, by allowing the clinician to observe the patient's respiratory pattern, including the use of accessory muscles of respiration [7].The presence of dyspnea, along with risk factors for developing severe disease (table 1), can be used to guide clinicians in determining whether a patient requires in-person evaluation. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below.)Oxygenation assessment — If a patient with COVID-19 has access to a reliable pulse oximeter at home, and can adequately measure and report the results to the clinician, measurement of oxygen saturation can be used as an additional piece of information to assess their clinical status. Patients are advised to use their pulse oximeter on warm fingers, as readings obtained on cold digits may not be as accurate [37]. In the outpatient setting, we instruct patients to check their oximetry twice daily and inform us if the value drops below 95 percent.●For any patient with an oxygen saturation of ≤94 percent on room air, in-person evaluation is warranted. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)●For patients who have an oxygen saturation of ≥95 percent on room air, the decision on in-person evaluation depends on other clinical features such as severity of dyspnea, risk for severe disease, and assessment of overall acuity. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' below.)Oximetry should only be considered within the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation; a normal oxygen saturation level cannot be used to exclude clinically significant respiratory involvement in a patient with concerning symptoms such as progressive or severe dyspnea or high overall acuity level (see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' below). In addition, although normal oximetry can be reassuring, there is no guarantee that respiratory status will not deteriorate as illness progresses.Of note, we do not consider oxygen saturation readings obtained through an application (""app"") on a mobile telephone accurate enough to depend upon for clinical use [38].As with dyspnea, the availability of telemedicine with video capability may allow the indirect assessment of hypoxia by the observation of cyanosis, if present [7].Assessment of overall acuity level — In addition to evaluation of respiratory status, we assess the patient's overall acuity level by asking questions regarding orthostasis, dizziness, falls, hypotension (if home blood pressure measurement is available), mental status change (eg, lethargy, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing), observed cyanosis, and urine output. While mild orthostasis symptoms may be addressed with instruction to increase fluids, mental status changes, falls, cyanosis, hypotension, anuria, and chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are concerning and warrant in-person evaluation. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' below.)Assess home setting and social factors — We assess the ability of patients to monitor their symptoms and to understand the importance of seeking medical guidance should symptoms progress. Patients who lack the ability to self-monitor and self-report may need more intensive staff outreach in order to be adequately managed at home.In addition, in accordance with interim CDC guidelines on home management, we assess if the patient's residential setting is appropriate for home management and recovery [39]; patients managed at home should be capable of adhering to appropriate infection control and isolation precautions for the duration of illness and recovery (including using a separate bedroom if not living alone). Other important home resources include an available caregiver, adequate access to food, and assistance with activities of daily living if necessary. Whether the patient has any household members who are at high risk for severe disease is another consideration (table 1). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.)DETERMINE IF IN-PERSON EVALUATION WARRANTED — Based upon the above assessment, in particular the risk for developing severe disease, dyspnea and oxygenation, and overall acuity level, we determine the urgency and appropriate setting (in-person evaluation versus scheduled telehealth follow-up or self-care) for further management. For those patients who warrant in-person evaluation, we decide if outpatient clinic or emergency department (ED) evaluation is appropriate. (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)While we use the following general criteria to determine the most appropriate clinical setting for in-person evaluation, these criteria are not fixed and will vary by institution, region, and even over time with changing resource availability.In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level — All patients with moderate or severe dyspnea, an initial oxygen saturation <95 percent on room air, or symptoms consistent with higher acuity level warrant in-person evaluation, either in the ED or in an outpatient clinic, depending upon the severity of findings.Criteria for evaluation in ED — We typically refer patients with one or more of the following features to the ED for further management:●Severe dyspnea (dyspnea at rest, and interfering with the inability to speak in complete sentences) (see 'Dyspnea assessment' above)●Oxygen saturation on room air of ≤90 percent, regardless of severity of dyspnea (see 'Oxygenation assessment' above)●Concerning alterations in mentation (eg, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing) or other signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion or hypoxia (eg, falls, hypotension, cyanosis, anuria, chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome)(see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above)Patients meeting the above criteria will typically be admitted to the hospital for inpatient evaluation and management. However, there are no fixed criteria for inpatient hospital admission with COVID-19; criteria vary by country and region. Further, in areas of high infection prevalence, the criteria may also vary with the availability of hospital resources. A lower threshold for hospitalization may be feasible in settings where the burden of disease does not exceed resource availability; in the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel suggests hospitalization for most patients with moderate to severe disease (eg, evidence of lower respiratory tract infection with or without hypoxia) [40]. As our inpatient hospital resources are outpaced by patient volume in the setting of a surge of COVID-19 cases, we have established an outpatient system to closely follow-up and monitor such patients who do not get admitted. However, this approach may not be appropriate in settings with more limited outpatient resources. (See 'Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic' below.)Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic — Patients with one of more of the following features are typically appropriate for evaluation in an outpatient clinic (ideally a dedicated respiratory/COVID-19 clinic if available), provided they do not meet any of the above criteria for evaluation in the ED:●Mild dyspnea in a patient with an oxygen saturation on room air between 91 to 94 percent (see 'Dyspnea assessment' above) ●Mild dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease (table 1) (see 'Assess risk for severe disease' above and 'Dyspnea assessment' above)●Moderate dyspnea in any patient●Symptoms concerning enough to warrant in-person evaluation (eg, mild orthostasis) but not severe enough to require ED referral (see 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above)Clinic evaluation — For patients evaluated in an outpatient clinic (if feasible, a respiratory/COVID-19 clinic), we assess the patient's respiratory and circulatory status, and we evaluate for other potentially treatable causes of symptoms [11]. (See 'Managing other potential causes of symptoms' below.)Based upon a careful clinical history and physical exam, including vital signs as well as measurements of oxygen saturation at rest and with ambulation, we then determine if the patient is appropriate for self-care, home management with telehealth follow-up, or transfer to the ED. Of note, we have found chest imaging to be of limited utility in the evaluation of most patients with COVID-19 in the outpatient clinic; the patient's clinical presentation is a more important consideration in our management decision. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Imaging findings'.)The capability to manage patients in an ambulatory setting (eg, the ability to administer intravenous fluids and medications and to arrange for outpatient follow-up) will vary between institutions and by region and thus influence this decision. In addition, we also consider the patient's home setting and social factors in determining the appropriateness of continued outpatient (clinic and teleheath) management.Home oxygen therapy with oximetry for some patients — For some patients with COVID-19, stable dyspnea, and mild hypoxia, we consider providing home oxygen therapy with home oximetry monitoring if such services are available.In order to consider patients for home oxygen therapy with home oximetry for management of COVID-19, we use the following criteria:●The patient has nonsevere (mild or moderate) dyspnea, with stable, nonprogressive symptoms over several days.●Oxygen saturation is 91 to 93 percent and increases to ≥95 percent with administration of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 liters/minute; we do not titrate to a saturation above 96 percent.●The patient is likely to be adherent with therapy and recommended follow-up.Initiation of home oxygen therapy is not appropriate for patients with new onset of dyspnea and hypoxia early in the onset of illness. Severe pulmonary involvement may develop even among patients at low risk for severe disease, and the need for supplemental oxygen early in the course of illness suggests the need for hospital admission and close monitoring. In addition, in any patient with an increasing oxygen requirement at any point during the course of illness, hospitalization is often indicated.Patients sent home on oxygen therapy require close follow-up; daily clinician telehealth visits are scheduled, and patients are instructed to check oximetry three times daily. Patients receiving home oxygen should contact a clinician if:●Oxygen saturation levels are declining on the established flow rate. In such cases, remote clinician evaluation is performed to determine if in-person reevaluation is warranted. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' above.)●The oxygen saturation level drops below 91 percent, in which case ED evaluation is indicated. (See 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above.)●Worsening dyspnea develops, in which case in-person reevaluation is warranted independent of oximetry results. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' above.)Guidelines on managing critically ill patients with COVID-19 suggest initiating supplemental oxygen when the oxygenation saturation is <90 percent [41]. However, there are no data that inform outcomes using home oxygen and oximetry monitoring in outpatients with COVID-19 or that address optimal oxygen titration in such patients. Additionally, some guidelines suggest that COVID-19 patients with an oxygen saturation of ≤93 percent on room air be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management [40]. Nevertheless, our approach is based upon our clinical experience managing patients with COVID-19 in a setting where inpatient hospital resources are limited due to surging patient volume, and we have established a system to closely follow-up and monitor these patients in the outpatient setting. This approach may not be appropriate in settings with more limited outpatient resources. Ideally, home oxygen therapy and monitoring should be evaluated in the setting of a clinical trial or a rapid-cycle quality improvement project to determine if such an intervention can decrease the use of health care facilities (eg, clinic visits, hospitalizations) without negatively impacting health outcomes.In addition, health insurance coverage restrictions may limit the use of home oxygen therapy for these patients, and out-of-pocket costs may be prohibitive for some patients without health insurance.Some patients warrant transfer from clinic to ED — After initial evaluation in the outpatient clinic, some patients may require more intensive management in the ED. In particular, some patients may require ED management if they have an increased work of breathing or a history of a rapid decline in respiratory function. Additional criteria for ED evaluation are reviewed elsewhere. (See 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above.)Home management without in-person evaluation for others — The majority of patients without moderate or severe dyspnea or hypoxia can remain at home for management without in-person evaluation, if they can reliably report worsened symptoms and can self-isolate for the anticipated duration of illness.The components of home management and counseling for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are discussed elsewhere. (See 'Management and counseling for all outpatients' below.)Whether such patients warrant telehealth follow-up depends upon their risk for severe disease and the extent of dyspnea (table 1):●Patients who are not at high risk for severe disease, and have no dyspnea are discharged to self-care at home; they do not need in-person evaluation or scheduled follow-up telehealth visits. They receive instructions to contact their clinician with any worsening symptoms.●Patients who are not at high risk for severe disease, and who have mild dyspnea, do not need in-person evaluation but are scheduled for telehealth follow-up visits.●Patients who are high risk for severe disease, and with no dyspnea, are scheduled for telehealth follow-up visits.The frequency and content of follow-up telehealth evaluation is discussed elsewhere. (See 'Telehealth follow-up' below.)Supervised residential care to facilitate isolation — Patients who would be appropriate for home care (with or without telehealth follow-up) but are unable to be adequately managed in their usual residential setting are candidates for temporary shelter in supervised residential care facilities, if available [42].In particular, patients who may be unable to adequately self-isolate (eg, patients living in multigenerational households, patients living with other high-risk individuals (table 1), patients experiencing homelessness) should be provided resources such as dedicated housing units, where available. Disruption of families should be minimized as much as possible. Every attempt should be made to avoid hospitalization simply for the purpose of facilitating self-isolation, as this option is typically not realistically available in regions with widespread disease.Unfortunately, dedicated residential care facilities for COVID-19 patients are not widely available in many countries and regions, and community-based solutions to self-isolation should be explored.MANAGEMENT AND COUNSELING FOR ALL OUTPATIENTS — When clinically appropriate, it is generally preferable to manage patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 remotely via telehealth visits. (See 'Rationale for outpatient management and remote care' above.)Interim recommendations on the outpatient management of patients with COVID-19 are provided by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, and several academic medical centers [43-46]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Institutional protocols'.)Infection control — With all patients, we reinforce the importance of infection control and self-isolation and provide instructions on the anticipated duration of isolation. These are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Infection control in the home setting'.)Symptom management — Symptomatic treatment includes antipyretics and analgesics for myalgias and headaches and maintenance of oral fluid intake. We generally prefer acetaminophen; however, we inform patients that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use is acceptable if symptoms do not respond to acetaminophen. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Some patients with cough or dyspnea may experience symptomatic improvement with self-proning (resting in the prone rather than the supine position) [47]. However, patients are cautioned that progressive respiratory symptoms, particularly worsening dyspnea, should prompt contact with their clinician for further evaluation. (See 'Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea' below.)Managing other potential causes of symptoms — Since symptoms of COVID-19 can overlap with those of many common conditions, it is important to consider other possible etiologies of symptoms including other respiratory infections (eg, influenza, streptococcal pharyngitis, community-acquired pneumonia [CAP]), congestive heart failure, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and even anxiety (table 2) [11].For conditions that can be treated remotely, such as possible streptococcal pharyngitis, mild asthma exacerbations, or mild exacerbations of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), we will often treat without an in-person evaluation but with scheduled daily follow-up telehealth visits. Management of specific medical conditions is discussed in the relevant UpToDate topic reviews.The prevalence of other diseases should also be considered. As an example, in regions where COVID-19 is prevalent and seasonal influenza activity remains high, patients who have symptoms consistent with both conditions should be treated empirically for influenza.We also consider the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community in our determination whether to evaluate the patient in-person; clinical judgement, however, remains the most important consideration in this decision. As an example, in regions where COVID-19 prevalence is high, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize in-person evaluations if possible; remote evaluation and management of mild dyspnea, if clinically appropriate, is preferred. (See 'Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea' below and 'Consider additional causes of worsening dyspnea' below.)Limited role for COVID-19 specific therapy — A number of therapies are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, but none have proven efficacy. Some of these, such as hydroxychloroquine, are available for other indications but remain investigational for COVID-19. Medications for COVID-19 specific therapy should not be prescribed in the ambulatory setting outside of a clinical trial [48]; data are extremely limited, and there are concerns for potential toxicity in an unmonitored setting [49].A catalog of clinical trials can be found at covid-trials.org; the list of trials can be filtered by setting (eg, outpatient versus inpatient).Therapies under evaluation for treatment COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'COVID-19-specific therapy'.)Medication management — In general, the patient’s usual home medication regimen is not adjusted, although some changes may be needed. We advise patients who use nebulized medications to avoid their use in the presence of others and to use a metered dose inhaler preparation instead, when possible, to avoid potential aerosolization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Avoiding nebulized medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Nebulized medications (spontaneously breathing patients)'.)If patients already use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) device for management of obstructive sleep apnea, they may continue to use their machine; as with nebulizers, they are advised to use the device only when isolated from others.For patients taking an immunomodulating medication, we consult with the prescribing clinician about the relative risks and benefits of temporarily discontinuing it, which depend upon its indication and the severity of the underlying condition. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Adjusting immunosuppression' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Care of patients with systemic rheumatic disease during the pandemic"", section on 'Medication management with documented or presumptive COVID-19'.)Thromboprophylaxis may be appropriate for certain patients, such as those at high risk of venous thromboembolism. This is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis'.)Management of medications is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Managing chronic medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Avoiding nebulized medications' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Immunomodulatory agents' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to kidney disease and hypertension"", section on 'Renin angiotensin system inhibitors' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"", section on 'Outpatient thromboprophylaxis'.)Counseling on warning symptoms — We counsel all patients on the warning symptoms that should prompt reevaluation by telehealth visit and in-person, including emergency department (ED) evaluations. These include new onset of dyspnea, worsening dyspnea, dizziness, and mental status changes such as confusion. Patients are educated about the time course of symptoms and the possible development of respiratory decline that may occur, on average, one week after the onset of illness. In addition, we assess the availability of support at home, ensure that they know who to call should they need assistance, and reinforce when and how to access emergency medical services.Patients with obstructive lung disease (eg, COPD or asthma) are specifically advised to closely monitor their respiratory status, and are cautioned not to presume that any worsening shortness of breath is due to an exacerbation of their underlying lung disease.Addressing goals of care — Given the potential severity of COVID-19, all patients should have updated health care proxy and advance directive information in their electronic health record.For patients with significant underlying medical comorbidities and poor health status, COVID-19 may cause catastrophic illness including respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among such patients, those who develop life-threatening complications are likely to have a poor outcome despite the use of aggressive measures such as mechanical ventilation. For patients who are at highest risk of complications and who have the lowest likelihood of survival, the appropriateness of hospitalization and ventilator assistance should be discussed in advance of significant deterioration in clinical condition. For these patients, it may be appropriate to address home palliative care strategies in anticipation of need. Many institutions have palliative care and hospice programs to provide skilled nursing and social work support for patients and families. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Surge capacity and scarce resource allocation' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'End of life issues' and ""Advance care planning and advance directives"", section on 'COVID-19 resources'.)Convalescent plasma donation — We encourage all eligible patients to donate convalescent plasma after their recovery from COVID-19. To be eligible for plasma donation, patients must meet general criteria for blood donation (which were revised by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] in April, 2020 to increase the potential blood donor pool) and specific COVID-19 recovery guidelines [50]. (See ""Blood donor screening: Medical history"", section on 'COVID-19 pandemic revised deferral criteria' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Convalescent plasma'.)TELEHEALTH FOLLOW-UPFrequency of follow-up — For patients with COVID-19 determined to be appropriate for home management with telehealth follow-up, the frequency of telehealth visits is determined by their risk for severe disease (table 1), severity of respiratory symptoms, and our comfort level with their ability to self-report worsening symptoms. (See 'Home management without in-person evaluation for others' above.)●For most patients, telehealth visits are scheduled on days 4, 7, and 10 (following the onset of clinical illness).●However, for patients in whom we have the highest level of concern, we generally schedule the first follow-up telehealth visit within 24 hours. These include:•Patients aged ≥65 years who have one or more additional risk factors for severe disease (table 1)•Any patient with moderate dyspnea at the time of initial evaluation•Patients who we feel may not reliably report a deterioration in symptomsFor these patients, the frequency of subsequent telehealth visits can be reduced to every other day if the patient remains clinically stable.Repeat assessment of dyspnea and hypoxia — At each telehealth visit, we evaluate a patient's respiratory status, focusing on assessing for new or worsening dyspnea and hypoxia, as these are the most likely indications requiring in-person clinical reevaluation and potential hospitalization. In addition, we assess overall acuity level, ensuring that the patient remains clinically stable enough for remote management. (See 'Dyspnea assessment' above and 'Assessment of overall acuity level' above.)Reevaluation for worsening dyspnea — All patients who develop worsening or more severe dyspnea require further evaluation and management. We use the same criteria for determining whether a patient needs to be evaluated in-person as in our initial evaluation. (See 'Determine if in-person evaluation warranted' above.)For patients who do not meet criteria for in-person evaluation, and who have potentially treatable causes of dyspnea by clinical history (eg, anxiety, mild exacerbation of congestive heart failure, mild asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations), we typically treat these conditions remotely. However, these patients are closely followed with daily telehealth visits for at least the next several days or until they are improving. The frequency and duration of subsequent follow-up is determined by their clinical course.Dyspnea severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living or cause difficulty with speaking requires an in-person evaluation. Further, new dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease should prompt an in-person evaluation (table 1). The in-person evaluation should occur in the most appropriate clinical setting, depending upon the severity of dyspnea, and may vary by health care system. (See 'In-person evaluation for moderate/severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and concern for higher acuity level' above.)Consider additional causes of worsening dyspnea — In addition, even though some patients with worsening symptoms may be managed remotely, we perform an in-person evaluation if they have complaints suggestive of serious conditions or complications that are not amenable to telehealth management, such as severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; eg, new productive cough, pleuritic chest discomfort), asthma or COPD exacerbation (eg, cough, increasing wheezing), pulmonary embolism (eg, worsening dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis), heart failure (increasing dyspnea, edema, orthopnea) or acute pericarditis (eg, chest pain). This evaluation can take place in a respiratory (COVID-19) clinic or appropriate clinical care setting. Discussion of the evaluation and management of these conditions can be found in the relevant UpToDate topics.In particular, patients with suspected COVID-19 and dyspnea who have underlying obstructive lung disease (including COPD and asthma) present unique management challenges. For such patients, dyspnea may be simply due to an exacerbation of obstruction, and it is not possible to differentiate clinically between an isolated exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease and an exacerbation related to COVID-19. In such cases, a presumptive asthma or COPD exacerbation should be treated with a short course of oral corticosteroids and increased use of short-acting beta agonists. Patients on home oxygen at baseline should be evaluated for increased oxygen requirements. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic' and ""Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"".)OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT FOLLOWING INPATIENT OR ED DISCHARGE — After discharge from the inpatient hospital setting or the emergency department (ED), clinician follow-up is warranted, either in outpatient clinic or via telehealth visit. At each encounter after hospital or ED discharge, we reinforce the importance of infection control and provide counseling on the warning symptoms which should prompt reevaluation. (See 'Infection control' above and 'Counseling on warning symptoms' above.)In some cases, patients are discharged home or to supervised residential care from the inpatient hospital setting on low flow oxygen therapy, with oximetry monitoring by telehealth (preferred if available) or visiting nurse. The practice of sending patients home on supplemental oxygen is widely variable, however, and if done warrants close patient monitoring. (See 'Home oxygen therapy with oximetry for some patients' above.)Patients discharged home●Most patients discharged from the inpatient setting require a follow-up clinician visit within one to two days following discharge; depending on their unique clinical and social situation, telehealth visit or in-person outpatient visit may be appropriate.●For those patients evaluated and discharged from the ED and who are felt to need follow-up care, telehealth visits may also be appropriate. The timing of such visits, however, would vary depending upon patient acuity and indication.Patients discharged to supervised residential care for recovery — As part of the continuum of care of patients with COVID-19, temporary housing in supervised residential care facilities may also be appropriate for managing patients discharged from the inpatient hospital setting, as well as those evaluated and discharged from the ED. (See 'Supervised residential care to facilitate isolation' above.)Depending upon the type of facility, the patient's medical acuity, and available resources, telehealth follow-up may be appropriate; the intensity of telehealth follow-up will vary depending upon the indication for housing (eg, solely the need for isolation versus isolation with more acute medical need).SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topics (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy (The Basics)"" and ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and children (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●Our understanding of the spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as optimal management strategies continues to evolve. There are limited data informing outpatient management strategies, and the approach described here is based upon our clinical experience; clinicians should take into account the individual patient's clinical and social circumstances as well as the available resources. (See 'Introduction' above.)●Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. When possible, we favor a coordinated care management program that includes initial risk stratification, clinician telehealth visits (telephone call or video platform-based), a dedicated outpatient respiratory clinic, and a close relationship with a local emergency department (ED). (See 'General principles' above.)●Patients who live in regions with widespread community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have compatible symptoms are generally managed presumptively as having COVID-19, even if they have not been tested or have an initial negative test result (table 2). (See 'Suspicion for COVID-19 and role of testing' above.)●On initial evaluation, we assess risk factors for severe disease (table 1), dyspnea severity and duration (and oxygenation status of those with dyspnea), overall level of acuity, and the patient’s home setting to determine who warrants an in-person evaluation at an outpatient clinic or in the ED. The additional criteria we use to make this determination are not fixed and will vary by institution, region, and over time as resource availability evolves. (See 'Risk stratification' above.) (Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)We typically refer patients with one or more of the following features to the ED for further management (see 'Criteria for evaluation in ED' above):•Severe dyspnea (dyspnea at rest, and interfering with the inability to speak in complete sentences)•Oxygen saturation on room air of ≤90 percent, regardless of severity of dyspnea•Concerning alterations in mentation (eg, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing) or other signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion or hypoxia (eg, falls, hypotension, cyanosis, anuria, chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome)We refer patients for evaluation in an outpatient clinic if they have one or more of the following features without any of the preceding features (see 'Patients appropriate for evaluation in clinic' above):•Mild dyspnea in a patient with an oxygen saturation on room air between 91 to 94 percent•Mild dyspnea in a patient at high risk for severe disease (table 1)•Moderate dyspnea in any patient•Symptoms concerning enough to warrant in-person evaluation (eg, mild orthostasis) but not severe enough to require ED referralOther patients can generally remain at home for management without in-person evaluation if they can reliably report worsened symptoms and can self-isolate for the anticipated duration of illness. Whether such patients warrant telehealth follow-up depends upon their risk for severe disease and the extent of dyspnea. (See 'Home management without in-person evaluation for others' above.)●When managing outpatients with COVID-19 (see 'Management and counseling for all outpatients' above):•We reinforce the importance of infection control and self-isolation.

ID:127488,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens [1]. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [2]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV. The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [3].Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the WHO and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [4,5]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)This topic will discuss aspects of COVID-19 that are specific to children. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; more general aspects of the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19; management of COVID-19 adults; and other coronaviruses are discussed separately.●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Hypercoagulability"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Outpatient management in adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)●(See ""Coronaviruses"".)●(See ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"".)●(See ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The epidemiology of COVID-19 is discussed in detail separately. This section focuses on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in children. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Epidemiology'.) Can children get COVID-19? — Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less commonly than adults [6-11]. In a systematic literature review (from January 1 through March 18, 2020), children accounted for 1 to 5 percent of diagnosed COVID-19 cases [12]. Although surveillance definitions and criteria for testing have changed over time and geographically, the proportion of cases that have occurred in children from various countries (eg, China, South Korea, Italy, and the United States) are typically within this range [9,13-16].As of April 2, 2020, among the 149,760 laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 1.7 percent were in children <18 years; approximately 70 percent of these cases were from New York City, the rest of New York state, and New Jersey [9]. Approximately 90 percent of cases were associated with household or community exposure, and 10 percent were associated with travel.Although health care-associated outbreaks have been reported in children [17,18], most cases in children result from household exposure [9]. In retrospective studies of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from China, the household secondary attack rate among pediatric contacts has ranged from 4 to 7 percent [19,20]. In a review of cases from New York state (excluding New York City), the secondary attack rate among children <18 years was 27 percent [21]. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Transmission'.)The age distribution of cases in the United States was as follows [9]:●<1 year – 15 percent●1 to 4 years – 11 percent●5 to 9 years – 15 percent●10 to 14 years – 27 percent●15 to 17 years – 32 percentAlthough infants <1 year of age accounted for 15 percent of confirmed cases, the proportion of all cases that have occurred in infants (0.27 percent) is less than the proportion of the United States population that is <1 year of age [9].Among adult patients with COVID-19 in the United States, emerging data suggest that COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minority groups, perhaps related to underlying health conditions and economic and social conditions (eg, poverty, multigenerational households, employment in essential industries, lack of paid sick leave, limited access to medical care) [22-25]. The CDC's COVID-NET provides race/ethnicity information for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in children [26].Additional information related to COVID-19 activity in the United States (eg, outpatient visits, hospitalization) is available through the CDC's COVIDView. Can SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted through breast milk or during infant feeding? — It is unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk. The only report of testing found no virus in the maternal milk of six patients [27]. However, droplet transmission could occur through close contact during feeding (breastfeeding or bottle feeding). Strategies to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during infant feeding are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Breastfeeding and formula feeding'.)Can SARS-CoV-2 be acquired in utero? — Issues related to COVID-19 in pregnancy, including in utero transmission, are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"".)CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSAre the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than adults? — The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults, but fewer children than adults with documented infection report symptoms [9,10]. COVID-19 appears to be milder in children than in adults, although severe cases have been reported [28]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?' below.)Among 2572 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children <18 years reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by April 2, 2020, the median age was 11 years (range 0 to 17 years); 57 percent of cases were in boys [9]. In case series from China, the median age of affected children was approximately 7 years (range 1 day to 18 years); boys were affected slightly more often than girls (57 to 60 percent of cases) [6,7].In young infants, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause fever without an on obvious source and minimal respiratory symptoms [29,30]. In a case series of three infants from a single institution, all of the infants presented with fever and difficulty feeding; lymphopenia and thrombocytosis were consistent laboratory findings [30]. Fever and cough are the most common reported symptoms in children [7,9,31,32]. In the case series from the United States, complete information about symptoms was available for 291 children; 56 percent had fever, 54 percent had cough, and 13 percent has shortness of breath; 73 percent of children had at least one of these symptoms [9]. In another series of 1391 children evaluated for COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital, 171 (12 percent) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (via identification of RNA) [7]. Approximately 16 percent of children with confirmed infection were asymptomatic, 19 percent had upper respiratory infection, and 65 percent had pneumonia. Fever occurred at some point of illness in approximately 42 percent. Other common symptoms in this case series included cough (49 percent) and pharyngeal erythema (46 percent). Less common symptoms included fatigue, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, diarrhea, and vomiting. Similar clinical manifestations have been reported in smaller case series from China and Italy [31,33]. Some children presented with only gastrointestinal symptoms [6]. Additional symptoms that have been reported in adults include chills or shaking chills, myalgia, headache, and new loss of taste or smell [34]. Cutaneous findings have been reported infrequently and are not well characterized; they include maculopapular, urticarial, and vesicular eruptions and transient livedo reticularis [31,35-37]. Reddish-purple nodules on the distal digits (sometimes called ""COVID toes"") similar in appearance to pernio (chilblains) are described predominantly in children and young adults, although an association with COVID-19 has not been clearly established [35,38-41].Laboratory findings in children with confirmed infection from Wuhan were variable. Approximately one-quarter had white blood cell count <5.5 x 109/L (5500/microL) and 3.5 percent had lymphocyte count <1.2 x 109/L (1200/microL) [7]. Procalcitonin was elevated (>46 pg/mL) in 64 percent and C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated (>10 mg/L) in 20 percent. In adult patients, lymphopenia (specifically CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes [42]), elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, CRP, ferritin) have been associated with increased severity or worse outcomes. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'.)Chest radiographs may be unremarkable or demonstrate bilateral consolidation [43,44]. In a series of 171 children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, findings on chest computed tomography included ground glass opacity in 33 percent, local patchy shadowing in 19 percent, bilateral patchy shadowing in 12 percent, and interstitial abnormalities in 1 percent [7]. Radiographic findings may be present before symptoms [45,46]. In a study of eight Italian children hospitalized with documented COVID-19, findings on lung ultrasonography included subpleural consolidations and individual or confluent B lines [47]. These findings were concordant with radiographic findings in seven of the eight patients. They are similar to findings in adult patients with COVID-19. (See ""Bedside pleural ultrasonography: Equipment, technique, and the identification of pleural effusion and pneumothorax"", section on 'B lines and lung consolidation' and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'Clinical features and complications'.)Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?Frequency of severe disease in children — Although severe cases of COVID-19 in children, including fatal cases, have been reported, most children appear to have asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease and recover within one to two weeks of disease onset [6-9,28,33,48-57].In a series of 2135 children from China that included 728 children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease, approximately 55 percent of all cases were mild or asymptomatic, 40 percent of cases were moderate (eg, clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia without hypoxemia), 5 percent of cases were severe (eg, dyspnea, central cyanosis, hypoxemia), and <1 percent were critical (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock) [6]. Among the 376 infants <1 year of age with available information, approximately 11 percent had severe or critical disease. These findings should be interpreted with caution; many of the severe and critical cases were not laboratory confirmed and may have been caused by other respiratory infections. Potential risk factors for severe disease — Infants <1 year of age and children with certain serious underlying conditions appear to be at greater risk for severe disease [9,58]. The CDC's COVID-NET provides information about underlying medical conditions according to age [26], although robust evidence associating underlying conditions with severe illness in children is lacking [59]. Among 345 children from the United States with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and complete information about underlying conditions, 23 percent had an underlying condition. The most commonly reported underlying conditions were [9]:●Chronic pulmonary disease (including moderate to severe asthma)●Cardiovascular disease●Immunosuppression (eg, related to cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplant, high doses of glucocorticoids)In a cross-sectional study of 48 children admitted to pediatric intensive care units in North America, 40 children had underlying conditions [57]. The most common underlying conditions were medical complexity (defined as dependence on technological support in association with developmental delay and/or genetic anomalies) in 19, immune suppression or malignancy in 11, and obesity in 7. Although immunosuppression has been reported as an underlying condition in children with severe COVID-19 disease in some case series, the relationship between immune compromise and severe COVID-19 disease has not been well established. In a review of 178 children with cancer from a single institution in New York City, 20 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and only one required admission (noncritical) for symptoms related to COVID-19 [60]. COVID-19 was similarly mild in small surveys of children who developed COVID-19 while receiving immunosuppressive medications for kidney disease or inflammatory bowel disease [61,62].Other medical conditions that may increase the risk of severe disease in children based on data from adults include [55,58,63,64]:●Chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis●Chronic liver disease (eg, chronic hepatitis)●Endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus)●Severe obesity (body mass index ≥120 percent of the 95th percentile values; (figure 1A-B)) (see ""Definition, epidemiology, and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents"")Why COVID-19 appears to be less common and severe in children than in adults is unclear. Some considerations are a less intense immune response to the virus in children versus adults; cytokine release syndrome is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infections [65,66]. Another explanation is that viral interference in the respiratory tract of young children leads to a lower viral load in children. Finally, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, which may be expressed differently in the respiratory tract of children compared with adults [6,12,67,68].Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children — Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 that has been reported in children from Europe and North America. The clinical features of MIS-C are similar to those of Kawasaki disease, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and toxic shock syndrome. They include persistent fever, hypotension, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, myocarditis, and laboratory findings associated with increased inflammation; respiratory symptoms may be lacking (table 1). MIS-C is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"".)How often do children with COVID-19 require hospitalization? — A minority of children with COVID-19 require hospitalization, and very few require intensive care [7,9,69]. In case series, hospitalization and intensive care admission were more common among children with underlying conditions and infants <1 year of age, although hospitalization of infants may not reflect severity of illness. (See 'Are children at risk of having severe COVID-19?' above.)Among 2572 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children <18 years reported to the CDC by April 2, 2020, the estimated rate of hospitalization ranged from 6 to 20 percent, and the estimated rate of intensive care ranged from 0.58 to 2 percent [9]. In another series of 171 children from China with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, three children required intensive care and mechanical ventilation; all had coexisting conditions (one each with hydronephrosis, leukemia, and intussusception) [7]. By March 8, 2020, 87 percent of children had been discharged from the hospital, and one child died four weeks after admission (a 10-month old with concomitant intussusception who developed multiorgan failure). In a study from the Lombardy region of Italy, only 4 of 1591 patients (<1 percent) admitted to intensive care units with COVID-19 were younger than 20 years [69]. Additional information regarding hospitalization of children in the United States is available through the CDC's COVIDView.How should I evaluate a child with pharyngitis during the pandemic? — Given concerns SARS-CoV-2 may be spread from the upper airway of symptomatic or asymptomatic children [70], the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests avoidance of examination of the oropharynx unless it is essential [71]. When examination of the oropharynx is necessary (including obtaining oropharyngeal swabs), personal protective equipment should be worn, whether or not the child has symptoms compatible with COVID-19. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19'.)APPROACH TO DIAGNOSISWhat are the criteria for testing for COVID-19 in children? — Criteria for testing for COVID-19 vary geographically. In the United States, guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Infectious Diseases Society of America (table 2) may be adapted by state and local health departments depending upon test availability [72-74].Testing criteria suggested by the World Health Organization can be found in its technical guidance online. These are the same criteria used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Guidance for testing in other countries is discussed separately. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Outpatient testing criteria — The approach to testing varies according to test availability and other resources (eg, some communities have begun to offer COVID-19 testing to residents regardless of symptoms or previous testing).Given limited testing resources, our institutions perform targeted testing in the outpatient setting.For children who are evaluated for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (eg, fever, persistent cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea) in the emergency department or urgent care setting, we perform testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) if the child has:●An underlying condition that may increase the risk for severe disease; examples include:•An immune-compromising condition (eg, recipients of antineoplastic chemotherapy, recent hematopoietic cell transplantation, solid organ transplant recipients, primary immunodeficiency, HIV infection with CD4 count <15 percent)•Chronic cardiac disease (eg, cardiomyopathy, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, single ventricle physiology)•Chronic pulmonary disease (eg, requirement for supplemental oxygenation or noninvasive ventilation, severe persistent asthma)•Former preterm infants•Neuromuscular disease with impaired airway clearance•Poorly controlled type I diabetes mellitus•Severe obesity (body mass index ≥120 percent of the 95th percentile values; (figure 1A-B))●Known in-person exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 14 days●Presentation with severe illness (eg, new requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline, new or increased need for ventilation [invasive or noninvasive] [59])One of the authors' institutions has instituted a ""drive-thru"" assessment center for symptomatic patients (eg, fever, persistent cough) who are otherwise stable but have either:●Underlying conditions (eg, immune compromise, chronic cardiac or pulmonary disease)●Known in-person exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 14 daysThis assessment center also provides COVID-19 screening assessment before scheduled procedures (eg, cardiac catheterization, endoscopy).Inpatient testing criteria — Our institutions perform universal testing of hospitalized patients at the time of presentation, regardless of clinical symptoms or signs of COVID-19; infants born in the institution to a mother who tested negative for COVID-19 and are admitted to the nursery or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are an exception. This strategy was implemented to reduce hospital-associated transmission, given the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in children.For hospitalized children whose initial test results are negative and are scheduled for procedures (eg, endoscopy), we retest within 48 hours of the scheduled procedure.For patients with suspected nosocomial acquisition of a respiratory virus, we test for common respiratory pathogens (eg, via multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) as well as COVID-19.Laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 — Laboratory tests for COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Microbiologic diagnosis'.)Detection of other respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in nasopharyngeal specimens does not exclude COVID-19 [32,55,66,75-78]. In one study, 8 of 20 children positive for SARS-CoV-2 were also positive for other common respiratory pathogens [79].MANAGEMENTShould NSAIDs be avoided? — The uncertainty about the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with COVID-19 is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Uncertainty about NSAID use'.)Assessment of severity — We use the definitions of severity provided in the multicenter initial guidance on the use of antivirals for children with COVID-19 [59]:●Mild or moderate disease – No new or increased supplemental oxygen requirement●Severe disease – New requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline without new or increased need for ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive)●Critical disease – New or increased need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, sepsis, multiorgan failure, or rapidly worsening clinical trajectoryInpatient management of children with COVID-19 — Children with COVID-19 and severe or critical lower respiratory tract disease generally require hospital admission. Children with nonsevere COVID-19 may require hospital admission if they are at risk for severe disease due to underlying conditions (eg, immune compromise).Supportive care for all patients — We provide supportive care for all pediatric patients with COVID-19 as recommended by various national committees [59,80,81]. Supportive care is the mainstay of therapy for children with severe or critical COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 improve with supportive care, even those with severe disease [59,82]. (See 'Society guideline links' below.)Routine supportive care measures includes:●Provision of respiratory support, including supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive); respiratory status may change suddenly after approximately one week of symptoms [83].●Provision of fluid and electrolyte support. (See ""Fluid and electrolyte therapy in newborns"" and ""Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children"" and ""Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children"".)●Provision of empiric antibiotics as indicated for community-acquired or health care-associated pneumonia; continuation of empiric antibiotics should be determined by cultures and other microbial tests and clinical condition. Bacterial coinfections appear to be infrequent [84]. (See ""Pneumonia in children: Inpatient treatment"".)●Monitoring for cytokine release syndrome by monitoring blood pressure for hypotension, oxygen saturation for worsening hypoxemia, and biomarkers. We obtain baseline C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). We monitor CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, and LDH two or three times per week or if there is concern for worsening disease. IL-6 is performed offsite; we repeat it twice per week if it is elevated at baseline or if there is concern for worsening disease.For children receiving immunosuppressive therapy, we discuss the benefits and risks of reducing immunosuppressive therapy with the prescribing specialist (eg, oncologist, transplant clinician, rheumatologist) [85]. Although the relationship between immune compromise and severe COVID-19 disease has not been well established in children [61,62], management of viral infections in immunocompromised hosts typically includes reduction of baseline immunosuppression, if reduction is possible [86,87]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Issues related to solid organ transplantation"", section on 'Adjusting immunosuppression'.)Antiviral therapy for select patients — Given the lack of data from controlled trials supporting the efficacy of antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19 in children, we agree with recommendations from the multicenter initial guidance on the use of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 and other experts that antiviral therapy for COVID-19 should occur in the context of a clinical trial [59,88]. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from ClinicalTrials.gov.Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 generally should be reserved for children with documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection if testing is available [59].●Potential indications – Decisions to use antiviral therapy should be individualized according to disease severity, clinical trajectory, and underlying conditions that may increase the risk for progression. Studies of the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapy have predominantly been performed in adults with severe lower respiratory tract disease [89,90]; these studies are discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Specific treatments'.)Children with COVID-19 in whom the risks of unproven antiviral therapy may be warranted include those with severe or critical disease and those with mild or moderate disease and an underlying condition that may increase the risk of severe disease.●Choice of agent/regimen•Remdesivir – When a decision is made to use antiviral therapy, we agree with the multicenter panel that remdesivir is preferred to other agents. Although data regarding the benefits of remdesivir for children with COVID-19 are lacking, it is preferred to other antiviral agents because emerging data from comparative, randomized trials and case series in adult patients suggest that it may be beneficial and appears to be well tolerated [59,91,92]. Studies of remdesivir in adult patients with COVID-19 are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Remdesivir'.)Remdesivir is dosed according to weight as follows: -≥3.5 to <40 kg: 5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) loading dose on day 1, followed by 2.5 mg/kg IV every 24 hours for 5 to 10 days (5 days for those with a rapid clinical response)-≥40 kg: 200 mg IV loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV every 24 hours for 5 to 10 days (5 days for those with a rapid clinical response)Remdesivir is a prodrug of a nucleotide analog that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and has activity against coronaviruses [93-95]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for hospitalized children and adults with severe COVID-19 (ie, oxygen saturation ≤94 percent on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) [96].Reported adverse effects of remdesivir include nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations.•Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine – The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 is uncertain. Although hydroxychloroquine is being investigated as a treatment for COVID-19, it is not licensed for this indication [97]. It is ideally used only in hospitalized patients in the context of a clinical trial [98].Hydroxychloroquine (without azithromycin) is an alternative to remdesivir for children who warrant antiviral therapy who are not candidates for remdesivir or if remdesivir is unavailable [59]. Given the lack of proven benefit and potential risks, we use it only in the context of a clinical trial. Hydroxychloroquine should be avoided in children with underlying QTc abnormalities and those who require other medications with potential for serious drug interaction with hydroxychloroquine. Before initiating hydroxychloroquine, specific interactions with other medications should be checked by use of a drug interactions program, such as the Lexicomp drug interactions tool provided by UpToDate.The multicenter panel suggests either of the following regimens for hydroxychloroquine in children [59]:-13 mg/kg (maximum: 800 mg) orally, followed by 6.5 mg/kg (maximum: 400 mg) at 6, 24, and 48 hours after the initial dose (the duration can be extended for up to five days on a case-by-case basis)-6.5 mg/kg per dose (maximum: 400 mg per dose) orally twice per day on day 1, followed by 3.25 mg/kg (maximum: 200 mg/dose) orally twice per day for up to five daysHydroxychloroquine is thought to alter endosomal and lysosomal pH, inhibiting viral replication and propagation, although the exact mechanism of antiviral activity remains uncertain [99]. In the United States, the FDA has issued an emergency use authorization to allow the use of these agents in adolescents or adults hospitalized for COVID-19 when participation in clinical trials is not feasible [100].Clinical studies of hydroxychloroquine have been limited by small sample size and have included predominantly adult patients. They are discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine'.)Given the uncertain efficacy and potential cardiac toxicity, we avoid chloroquine and the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 in children [101].•Lopinavir-ritonavir – We do not recommend routine use of lopinavir-ritonavir given the absence of efficacy and unfavorable pharmacodynamics [90].Adjunctive therapy — We make decisions about the use of adjunctive therapies for immune-mediated complications of COVID-19 on a case-by-case basis according to disease severity. We do not routinely use immune modulators (eg, glucocorticoids, IL-6 inhibitors [eg, tocilizumab], interferon-beta 1b, convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients) in the treatment of children with COVID-19, except in the context of a clinical trial. The benefits and risks are uncertain [102].Although there is no available data on the use of vitamin A for the treatment of COVID-19, vitamin A has long been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of measles, and its use has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality from measles-associated pneumonia [103]. Vitamin A deficiency may be associated with impairment of humoral and cell-mediated immunity, and even mild vitamin A deficiency may lead to increased morbidity from measles and other viral respiratory infections [103]. (See ""Measles: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention"", section on 'Vitamin A'.)Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from ClinicalTrials.gov. Outpatient management of children with COVID-19Telephone triage for children — The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides guidance for telephone triage of children with possible COVID-19. How should children be managed at home? — Children with documented or suspected COVID-19 and mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, pharyngitis, other respiratory symptoms) generally should be managed at home unless they have a chronic condition that increases their risk of severe disease.Management is focused on prevention of transmission to others (ie, isolation), monitoring for clinical deterioration, and supportive care. Although the role of children in transmission is not clear [104], some evidence from a report of a cluster of cases in France suggests the possibility that children may not transmit SARS-CoV-2 as efficiently as other age groups, perhaps related to viral interference [105]. The CDC and World Health Organization provide additional guidance on what to do if you (or your child) is sick [106,107]. (See 'Prevention of transmission' below.)●Monitoring for clinical deterioration – Caregivers of children who are managed at home should be counseled about symptoms of clinical deterioration, which may occur suddenly after approximately one week of symptoms and should prompt urgent re-evaluation [83]. These include [106-109]:•Severe respiratory distress, difficulty breathing (for infants: grunting, central cyanosis, inability to breastfeed)•Chest pain or pressure•Blue lips or face•Findings associated with shock (eg, cold, clammy, mottled skin; new confusion; difficulty arousing; substantially reduced urine output)●Symptomatic and supportive care – Symptomatic care for COVID-19 in the outpatient setting is similar to that for other upper respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical syndromes:•Upper respiratory tract infection (see ""The common cold in children: Management and prevention"", section on 'Symptomatic therapy') •Pharyngitis (see ""Acute pharyngitis in children and adolescents: Symptomatic treatment"", section on 'Symptomatic treatment')•Acute gastroenteritis (see ""Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Management and prevention"", section on 'Management')The management of fever in children, including indications for treatment, are discussed separately. (See ""Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management"", section on 'Management of fever'.)When can home isolation be discontinued? — The optimal duration of home isolation is uncertain. How long a person remains infectious is uncertain. The duration of viral shedding is variable; there appears to be a wide range, which may depend on severity of illness. Among 110 children at Wuhan Children's Hospital, the median duration of viral shedding was 15 days from onset of illness (interquartile range 11 to 20 days); the duration was longer for symptomatic than asymptomatic children (17 versus 11 days) [110]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.)The CDC has issued recommendations on discontinuation of home isolation, which include both test-based and nontest-based strategies [111-113]. The choice of strategy depends upon the patient population (eg, immunocompromised versus nonimmunocompromised), the availability of testing supplies, and access to testing.Avoidance of unproven interventions — Hydroxychloroquine and other investigational agents should be used only under the supervision of a health care provider, as described above; misuse of nonpharmaceutical forms of the investigational agents (eg, chloroquine phosphate, which is used in home aquariums; ivermectin intended for animals) may lead to severe toxicity, including death [98,114,115]. (See 'Inpatient management of children with COVID-19' above.)PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSIONFrom infected mother to newborn — Prevention of transmission from infected mother to newborn after delivery is discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pregnancy issues"", section on 'Postpartum care'.)From children with documented or suspected COVID-19During cardiopulmonary resuscitation — Modifications to algorithms for pediatric basic and advanced life support to prevent transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are discussed separately. (See ""Pediatric basic life support for health care providers"", section on 'COVID-19 patients (suspected or confirmed)' and ""Pediatric advanced life support (PALS)"", section on 'COVID-19 patients (suspected or confirmed)'.)Hygiene and social distancing — Prevention of transmission focuses on hygiene and social distancing. This includes [106,107,116]:●Having friends or family members bring necessary items to the home (to be retrieved outside).●Having the child (and other sick family members) wear a mask if leaving the home cannot be avoided. At the time of discharge, if supplies allow, providing patients with a pair of gloves and several masks may help to prevent transmission to household contacts. In addition, for patients without access to private transportation, arranging medical transportation, if possible, is preferable to the use of public transportation or ride-sharing services to minimize exposure to the public. ●As much as possible, keeping ill family members ≥6 feet away from other people, especially family members who are ≥65 years of age or have serious medical conditions.If such separation is not possible, have the ill family member wear a face mask when they are in the same room or vehicle as other people.●Keeping ill family members separated from pets in the household.●Having family members who have fever or cough sleep in separate rooms and use separate bathrooms.●Avoiding sharing items (eg, pillows, blankets, utensils, cups).Additional information about how to care for people with documented, suspected, or possible COVID-19 at home is available from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization [106,107].Disinfection — Disinfection of frequently touched surfaces is also important, as discussed separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"", section on 'Environmental disinfection'.)For asymptomatic childrenShould routine health supervision appointments be rescheduled? — During the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefits of well-visits should be balanced with the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and other communicable illnesses, within the context of patient population and office environment [117-119]. When clinicians or practices are unable to provide well-child visits to all of the patients in their practice, the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) encourage prioritization of newborn care and vaccination of children through 24 months of age [119,120]. Disruption of immunization services increases the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses [121]. Adherence to recommendations for infants born to women who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or whose HBsAg status is unknown is particularly important for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus, especially if the delivery occurs at an unplanned facility or is attended by staff who are not knowledgeable about managing infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive [122]. (See ""Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview"", section on 'Benefits of vaccines' and ""Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents"", section on 'Routine infant immunization'.)Scheduling home visits, telemedicine, office space, and/or office locations can be used to keep well children and children who are ill or possibly ill separated (eg, scheduling well-visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon, seeing children for sick visits in a different part of the clinic, designated examination rooms, or at a different office site [or practice] than children for well-visits) [117,123-125].The AAP provides information and resources about telemedicine, including information about state-by-state payer policies.Use of cloth face masks — The CDC recommends that individuals ≥2 years of age wear a cloth face covering (eg, homemade masks or bandanas) when they are in public settings where social distancing may be difficult to achieve (eg, grocery stores, clinician offices), especially in areas with substantial community transmission [126]. Cloth masks are not recommended for children <2 years of age, because of concerns about suffocation [127]. The AAP provides additional information about cloth masks for children, including tips for increasing proper wearing and use. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Personal preventive measures'.)Should play dates and playgrounds be avoided? — Given the possibility of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from asymptomatic individuals (or presymptomatic individuals within the incubation period) [6,45,128-135], the CDC recommends that children not have play dates with children from other households and that when playing outside, they remain ≥6 feet from people from other households [136]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Viral shedding and period of infectivity'.)The CDC provides information about how to safely remain physically active at parks and recreational facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.Hand sanitizer safety — Although washing hands with soap and water, when available, is preferred for hand hygiene, alcohol-based hand sanitizer is safe for use in children when the sanitizer is used according to the information on the Drug Facts label; there is no cause for concern if children eat or lick their hands after the hand sanitizer has fully dried [137]. However, because ingestion of even a small amount of liquid hand sanitizer can cause alcohol poisoning in children (including hypoglycemia), children younger than six years should be supervised when using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be kept out of the reach and sight of children [138]. (See ""Ethanol intoxication in children: Epidemiology, estimation of toxicity, and toxic effects"" and ""Ethanol intoxication in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and management"".)SPECIAL POPULATIONSChildren with asthma — Considerations related to COVID-19 in children with asthma include the safety of glucocorticoid and nebulized medications. These considerations are discussed separately. (See ""An overview of asthma management"", section on 'Advice related to COVID-19 pandemic'.)Children with special health care needs — The American Academy of Pediatrics provides information about how to keep children with special health care needs safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — The European attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guidelines group provides guidance for management of ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance for starting stimulants or atomoxetine in children who did not have an in-person cardiovascular assessment before the pandemic [139,140].OTHER ISSUES●What type of infant formula can be substituted if the usual formula is not available? – The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) provides advice for providers and families if infant formula is not available.●What are the effects of prolonged home confinement? – Although prolonged home confinement may provide an opportunity to enhance parent-child relationships, it may adversely affect children's physical and mental health [141-150]. They may be less physically active, spend more time with electronic devices, and eat a poorer quality diet. Mental health stressors include fear of infection, boredom, and social isolation. In a survey of primary school students from Hubei province in China after being restricted to home for a mean of 35 days, the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety (approximately 20 percent for each) was greater than that in other surveys [148]. School closures related to health emergencies have been associated with increased risk of violence and vulnerability [144,151]. Vulnerable children and adolescents (eg, those who are homeless or in foster care, have a history of maltreatment, are sexual or gender minorities) are at particular risk for violence and adverse mental health effects [149]. Adverse mental and physical health effects can be mitigated and parent-child relations enhanced through parental role-modeling of healthy behaviors, involving children in family activities, promotion of self-discipline and self-sufficiency skills, and having direct, developmentally appropriate conversations with children about the pandemic [141,146,152-154].Clinicians should consider the potential for violence and look for signs of parental stress, irritability, depression, and/or harsh responses to child behaviors during each clinical encounter [151]. They should ask about parent stress levels, methods to manage stress, social supports, and substance use. Clinicians can offer coping strategies (eg, deep breathing, calling a friend or family member), resources, and/or referrals to mental health providers to families who may benefit from these interventions. •Resources related to child care and prevention of violence during the COVID-19 pandemic include:-Child Care Aware of America-Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children-The National Child Traumatic Stress Network•Resources for talking with children about COVID-19 are available from multiple professional groups and others, including:-The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry-The AAP: Talking to children about COVID-19-Coronavirus: A book for children (written by Elizabeth Jenner, Kate Wilson, and Nia Roberts; illustrated by Axel Scheffler)-COVIBOOK for children younger than seven years-The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-The National Association of School Psychologists-The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Inter-Agency Standing Committee (a children's book for children approximately 6 to 11 years of age)●What resources are available for home schooling children and keeping them occupied during the pandemic? – Several national organizations provide educational resources for children, including, among others [123,144]:•AAP:-Working and learning from home during the COVID-19 outbreak-Getting children outside while social distancing for COVID-19-Teens and COVID-19: Challenges and opportunities during the outbreak•National Association for the Education of Young Children•National Head Start Association Resources for Parents•Opening Doors/Abriendo Puertas•Sesame Workshop•United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)•The World Health Organization•Zero to ThreeSOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed.

Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (See 'Introduction' above.)●Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less frequently than adults. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)●COVID-19 in children is usually mild, although severe cases have been reported, including cases with clinical features similar to toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease (table 1). In case series of children with COVID-19, the most common symptoms in children are fever and cough. Other symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, diarrhea, and vomiting. Additional symptoms that have been reported in adults include chills or shaking chills, myalgia, headache, and new loss of taste or smell. Laboratory findings are often normal but may include leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and elevated procalcitonin or C-reactive protein. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)●Criteria for testing for COVID-19 vary geographically. In the United States, guidance provided by the CDC and Infectious Diseases Society of America (table 2) may be adapted by state and local health departments depending upon test availability. (See 'What are the criteria for testing for COVID-19 in children?' above.)•Given limited testing resources, our institutions perform targeted testing in the outpatient setting. For children who are evaluated for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in the emergency department or urgent care setting, we perform testing for SARS-CoV-2 if the child has an underlying condition that may increase the risk for severe disease, known in-person exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 14 days, or presentation with severe illness. (See 'Outpatient testing criteria' above.)•We perform universal testing of hospitalized patients at the time of presentation, regardless of clinical symptoms or signs of COVID-19; infants born in the institution to a mother who tested negative for COVID-19 and are admitted to the nursery or neonatal intensive care unit are an exception. (See 'Inpatient testing criteria' above.) ●Children with COVID-19 and severe or critical lower respiratory tract disease generally require hospital admission. Severe disease is defined by a new requirement for supplemental oxygen or increased requirement from baseline without new or increased need for ventilatory support (noninvasive or invasive). Critical disease is defined by new or increased need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, sepsis, multiorgan failure, or rapidly worsening clinical trajectory. (See 'Assessment of severity' above.)●Supportive care (eg, respiratory support, fluid and electrolyte support, monitoring for cytokine release syndrome) is the mainstay of therapy for children with severe or critical COVID-19. (See 'Supportive care for all patients' above.)●We agree with recommendations from the multicenter initial guidance on the use of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 and other experts that antiviral therapy for COVID-19 should occur in the context of a clinical trial. (See 'Antiviral therapy for select patients' above.)•Decisions regarding antiviral therapy should be individualized according to disease severity, clinical trajectory, and underlying conditions that may increase the risk for progression.•When a decision is made to use antiviral therapy, we prefer remdesivir to other agents. Hydroxychloroquine (without azithromycin) is an alternative for children who are not candidates for remdesivir or if remdesivir is unavailable. ●Children with documented or suspected COVID-19 and mild symptoms (eg, fever, cough, pharyngitis, other respiratory symptoms) generally should be managed at home unless they have a chronic condition that increases their risk of severe disease. Management is focused on prevention of transmission to others (ie, isolation), monitoring for clinical deterioration (eg, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, symptoms of shock), and supportive care. (See 'How should children be managed at home?' above.)●Symptomatic care for COVID-19 in the outpatient setting is similar to that for other upper respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical syndromes. It is discussed separately. (See ""The common cold in children: Management and prevention"", section on 'Symptomatic therapy' and ""Acute pharyngitis in children and adolescents: Symptomatic treatment"", section on 'Symptomatic treatment' and ""Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management"", section on 'Management of fever' and ""Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Management and prevention"", section on 'Management'.)●Prevention of transmission focuses on hygiene and social distancing. The CDC and WHO provide guidance about preventing transmission of COVID-19 in the home and outpatient setting.

ID:127828,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Psychiatric symptoms and disorders,"INTRODUCTION — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly transmissible and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is often lethal and has reached pandemic scale worldwide in 2020 [1]. The disease is associated with multiple psychiatric problems in clinicians who care for patients with COVID-19 or suspected illness [2,3]. In addition, COVID-19 may precipitate anxiety, depression, and sleep problems in patients with COVID-19 and may adversely affect patients with established psychiatric disorders. This topic addresses the epidemiology, clinical features, course of illness, and management of psychiatric issues that are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Other topics discuss COVID-19 per se and related issues arising in different specialties, such as cardiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and oncology.EPIDEMIOLOGY — A limited number of studies describe the prevalence of mental health sequelae associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Health care workers — Psychiatric symptoms and disorders can occur in clinicians exposed to COVID-19 [3]. As an example, one cross-sectional study used self-report instruments to assess hospital-based physicians and nurses (total n >1200) in China from January 29 to February 3, 2020 [2]. The prevalence of moderate to severe psychiatric symptoms was as follows:●Anxiety – 12 percent●Depression – 15 percent●Insomnia – 8 percent●Traumatic distress – 35 percentIn addition, roughly one-quarter to one-third of clinicians had mild symptoms. Another cross-sectional study assessed nearly 300 hospital-based physicians and nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in Singapore from February 19 to March 13, 2020, using self-report screening instruments [4]. Relatively few clinicians screened positive for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; approximately 5 to 10 percent), which the authors attributed to better preparedness of the clinicians based upon their previous experience with the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic.Risk factors and protective factors — A review of 59 studies of viral outbreaks such as the SARS epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic identified multiple risk factors and protective factors for psychiatric problems in health care workers [5]:●Risk factors – The most consistent risk factor across studies was increased contact with affected patients. Other consistent predictors were a prior history of psychiatric symptoms/disorders and/or general medical illnesses, spending a prolonged time in quarantine, perceived lack of organizational support, and perceived social stigma directed towards health care workers. ●Protective factors – Across studies, the factor that most consistently decreased the risk of adverse psychological outcomes in health care workers was access to personal protective equipment. Other consistent protective factors included having supportive peers, access to psychiatric interventions, and trust in the institution’s infection control measures, as well as receiving clear communication from supervisors and adequate time off from work. Patients with COVID-19 — Few data are available regarding psychiatric problems in patients with COVID-19. However, based upon studies conducted during the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong, we anticipate that many patients with COVID-19 will develop anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, PTSD, and substance use disorders [6,7]. As an example, at the peak of the 2003 epidemic, a prospective study enrolled 79 patients with SARS, including 30 infected health care workers (primarily nurses), and 145 healthy controls [8]. Self-reported stress was greater among the infected patients than controls, as were negative psychological effects such as dysphoria, impaired sleep, poor concentration, and impaired judgment. However, most patients and controls also reported positive psychological effects such as awareness of hygiene, physical state, and current affairs. In addition, COVID-19 appears to affect central nervous system function, which may indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are likely to occur in some patients. (See 'Pathogenesis' below.) Patients with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses — It appears that the psychological effects of COVID-19 are adversely affecting many patients with pre-existing mental disorders (ie, onset of the disorder occurred prior to the pandemic). As an example, approximately 20 to 25 percent think they are coping poorly and deteriorating:●A self-report, online survey of outpatients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders (n >1400), which was conducted in China from February to March 2020, found that deterioration related to the pandemic was reported by 21 percent [9]. Mental health problems included anxiety, depression, and insomnia, which were attributed to fear of infection, restrictions on transportation, and isolating at home.●In a self-report, online survey of individuals who self-identified as having a mental illness such as an anxiety disorder, unipolar major depression, or bipolar disorder (total n = 193), approximately twice as many were coping poorly compared with coping well (23 and 12 percent) [10]. The majority had specific concerns about the pandemic and their mental health, such as worsening of their illness (64 percent), inability to receive treatment (39 percent), and running out of medication (38 percent). Patients with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and individuals who are homeless are especially likely to suffer from the pandemic, being at risk not only for COVID-19 based upon their social circumstances, but also more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses that put them at risk for poorer health outcomes once infected [11,12]. In addition, their cognitive difficulties and marginalized social status may impair their ability to follow public health prescriptions intended to minimize spread of the infection.General population — The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, distress, and PTSD in the general population of adults and children, as described in the studies immediately below. However, it is not clear that the prevalence of adverse psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic exceeds the baseline prevalence:●A cross-sectional study of adults (n = 1060) in January and February 2020, using a self-report measure, found that clinically significant psychological distress was present in 12 percent [13]. Distress was greater in those who were aged 50 years and older, were divorced or widowed, and employed as health care workers.●A cross-sectional, self-report internet survey of adults (n = 285) in February 2020 found that clinically significant symptoms of PTSD (intrusion symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in mood and cognition, plus hyperarousal) were present in 7 percent [14]. Women and individuals with sleep problems reported more symptoms of PTSD.●Chinese students in grades 2 through 6, who were quarantined at home for an average of 34 days, completed a cross-sectional, online, self-report survey in February and March 2020 [15]. Anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were each reported by roughly 20 percent and almost two-thirds were worried about becoming infected. Older individuals (eg, ≥70 years), immunocompromised patients, and patients with chronic disease may also experience increased anxiety, depression, and worry [16,17]. PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms and disorders that arise during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may include biologic and psychosocial factors.COVID-19 may directly affect central nervous system function: ●A retrospective chart review of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 214) found that central nervous system manifestations (eg, dizziness, headache, or impaired consciousness) occurred in 25 percent [18]. ●A retrospective study of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19 (n = 58) found multiple neurologic and psychiatric features, such as agitation (69 percent), confusion (65 percent), and corticospinal tract signs (67 percent) [19]. At the time of discharge, one-third of patients had impaired neuropsychologic function, including inattention, disorientation, or poorly organized movements to command. However, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in seven patients was negative for the virus, suggesting that the neurologic findings may have resulted from encephalopathy secondary to critical illness, cytokines, or medications, rather than the direct effect of viral infection. These findings are consistent with a literature review that found past viral epidemics were associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as demyelination, encephalopathy, and neuromuscular dysfunction, as well as mood changes and psychosis [20]. The symptoms occurred during infection or following recovery from the infection in the ensuing weeks, months, or longer. Immunologic findings in patients with COVID-19 include elevated serum C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-6) and decreased total blood lymphocyte counts [20].Critical illness and resultant intensive care unit stays commonly expose patients to extreme physiological and psychological stressors that are life-threatening and frequently precipitate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The estimated of rate of PTSD in these settings varies widely, but least-biased study estimates suggest a rate of 25 to 45 percent [21].In addition, psychiatric illnesses that occur during the pandemic may stem from psychosocial factors such as [3,6,16,22,23]:●Frequency and extent of exposure to individuals infected with the virus●Fear of infecting family members●Lack of access to testing and medical care for COVID-19●Physical distancing, home confinement, and quarantining●Inconsistent messages and directives regarding public health measures such as wearing face masks●Increased workloads●Economic hardships and insecurity●Shortages of available resources (eg, foods, paper products, and personal protective equipment)●Diminished personal freedoms●Continuous media reporting about the pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding its eventual outcomeAmong outpatients with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses (ie, onset prior to the pandemic), deterioration may occur because routine visits with clinicians are not available [9]. Consequently, patients who are unable to obtain refills may be forced to reduce the dose of their medications or stop them altogether, and some patients may not have the opportunity to adjust the dose or switch medications if they are ineffective or causing adverse effects.CLINICAL FEATURES — The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may give rise to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Overview — The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with psychiatric symptoms that do not necessarily rise to the level of a psychiatric disorder, based upon studies of previous epidemics. As an example, a review of 24 studies examined the psychological impact of quarantine in 10 countries during infectious disease outbreaks such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory system epidemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak [23]. Adverse psychological outcomes included anger, anxiety, boredom, confusion, fear, depression, emotional exhaustion, frustration, irritability, and stress. Other adverse outcomes include avoidance behaviors (eg, avoiding crowded or public places), detachment from others, subthreshold symptoms of alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, excessive preoccupation with distressing somatic symptoms, and stigma, as well as domestic violence and suicidal ideation and behavior [16,23].The COVID-19 pandemic may also lead to full-blown anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder; these disorders are discussed separately: ●(See ""Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●(See ""Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)●(See ""Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features"".)●(See ""Evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia in adults"", section on 'Clinical features'.)●(See ""Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, based upon studies that found previous viral epidemics were associated with increased rates of suicide deaths [24], including suicides that were reported as an adverse effect of quarantine [25]. Suicidality related to COVID-19 may be due to the hardships imposed by the pandemic, including economic privation, social isolation, reduced access to general medical and mental health care, and the stigma of having COVID-19 [9,16,22,24]. Health care workers — Studies of emerging viral outbreaks suggest that psychiatric symptoms and disorders are more likely to occur in health care workers who are at relatively high risk of exposure, compared with workers who are at low risk of exposure. As an example, a meta-analysis identified 25 studies (sample size not reported) of viral epidemics that examined psychiatric problems in health care workers who had direct contact with affected patients and health care workers who had little or no contact (controls) [5]. The analysis included 16 studies of the 2003 severe acute respiratory system epidemic and 5 of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary findings included the following:●Clinically significant psychological stress was more likely to occur in health care workers exposed to the virus than controls (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.0).●Clinically significant acute and/or posttraumatic distress was more likely to occur in workers exposed to the virus than controls (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.3).COURSE OF ILLNESS — Psychiatric problems related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may persist for at least three years beyond the pandemic, based upon retrospective studies of the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic. In these studies, individuals who were exposed to or survived SARS infection were assessed 2.5 to 3 years after the epidemic; moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were still present in roughly 20 to 30 percent. The risk for persistent psychiatric symptoms and disorders was higher in health care workers and individuals who were quarantined:●One year after the SARS epidemic, a study enrolled 96 individuals who survived SARS infection (including 33 health care workers) and 112 healthy controls [26]. Self-reported stress was greater among the SARS survivors than controls, and greater among health care worker SARS survivors than non-health care worker survivors. In addition, moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were present in approximately 33 percent of all survivors; anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were greater in females than males, and greater in health care worker SARS survivors than non-health care worker survivors.●In a study of hospital employees (n = 549) who were exposed to the SARS epidemic in Beijing, self-report assessments three years later indicated that moderate to severe depressive symptoms were present in 23 percent [27]. Perceived risk related to SARS during the epidemic and quarantining during the epidemic were each associated with higher levels of depression at follow-up.In addition, the assessments three years later found that among the 549 health care workers, at least one symptom of alcohol use disorder was present in approximately 19 percent [28]. Working in high risk locations (eg, SARS wards) during the epidemic and quarantining during the epidemic were each associated with symptoms of alcohol use disorder. ●A study interviewed 90 survivors of SARS infection approximately 2.5 years after hospitalization for the illness; a history of psychiatric disorders prior to infection was present in 7 percent [29]. At 2.5 years post-SARS, at least one psychiatric disorder was present in 33 percent of the survivors, including PTSD in 26 percent and depressive disorders in 16 percent. In addition, social and role functioning were each impaired in survivors.   ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS — Assessment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder are discussed separately: ●(See ""Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"".)●(See ""Evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia in adults"".)●(See ""Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"".)Individuals with moderate to severe distress, anxiety, or depression should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behavior; one can use a screening tool or directly ask. (See ""Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"", section on 'Screening'.)MANAGEMENT — Psychiatric issues related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can occur in multiple populations, including clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 or suspected illness, patients with COVID-19, and patients with established psychiatric disorders prior to COVID-19. In addition, family members of clinicians and patients may develop psychiatric symptoms or disorders. General approach — For individuals who experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic, stepped care may be an efficacious and cost-effective approach to treatment [30]. According to this approach, monitoring mental health problems is paramount. Surveillance for domestic violence and child abuse, both of which are predicted to increase during mandated stay-at-home orders, is also critical [30]. Individuals with low levels of symptoms are provided with self-help materials pertinent to their symptoms and concerns and are eligible to speak with a mental health professional if they have additional or persistent concerns [9]. Other interventions that may help individuals cope with mild psychiatric symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic include limiting one’s intake of print and broadcast news about the pandemic, as well as maintaining routines and structured activities such as exercise, and staying connected to family and friends via phone and computer [16]. Health care workers in particular are likely to benefit from private, on-demand access to mental health professionals who can address sources of anxiety, distress, and other emotions related to caring for patients [5,31,32]. Individuals with moderate to severe symptoms can be treated by their primary care provider or referred to a mental health specialist.If feasible, psychiatric care should be administered by computer or telephone rather than face-to-face [9,11,33]. Patient contact through voice or voice plus video may be superior to text messages and emails [6]. Evidence supporting the use of remote care includes a small study of outpatient psychiatrists (n = 20) in the United States who transitioned to telemedicine with video visits and/or phone visits in March 2020 and were interviewed the following month [34]. The study found that the transition was relatively positive for both patients and clinicians. Patient preference usually dictated whether visits were conducted by video or phone. Advantages of telepsychiatry included improved access for patients, patients feeling more relaxed and thus being more forthcoming, and the opportunity to see the patient’s home. Disadvantages included difficulty observing nonverbal patient cues and hearing patients, technical disruptions such as frozen screens, as well as patients lacking privacy and problems with distractions. Techniques that improved the visits included starting each visit by asking whether patients had enough privacy; if not, suggestions were offered such as using the car or rescheduling the visit. For video visits, the psychiatrists suggested using the same place in the office or home to provide consistency and reassurance for patients.In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration offered guidance on April 14, 2020 regarding the COVID-19 public health emergency and use of digital health devices that pose a low risk for treating psychiatric disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia disorder, PTSD, and unipolar major depression [35]. The guidelines recommend that the devices be used only as adjunctive treatment. Functions that these devices may perform include reminders about physical activities, mindfulness activities, and behavioral techniques that patients can use when experiencing increased anxiety.   When face-to-face visits are necessary, personal protective equipment (eg, masks) should be used and care should ideally be administered to individuals rather than groups. In-person visits with masks may be experienced as less personal and leave patients feeling less connected to the clinician, compared with voice plus video meetings.Psychiatrists may be asked to consult on patients receiving pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 and should therefore be familiar with some of the medications currently being used. As an example, hydroxychloroquine, which is an antimalarial drug that is used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients (and undergoing clinical trials), is associated with psychiatric side effects such as mood and anxiety disturbances, insomnia, and more rarely, psychosis. Patients should be asked about any other prescribed medications or supplements they may be taking in the belief they might reduce vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Specific interactions of psychiatric medications with other medications may be determined using the Lexicomp drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. Specific medications that are being evaluated for COVID-19 are described separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Specific treatments'.)Physical distancing, which is widely encouraged to decelerate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within the general public and “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 cases, will result in loneliness for some individuals, particularly those living alone, including the elderly. This is likely to exacerbate the high rates of loneliness already experienced by the elderly, especially those who rely on social services rather than family for human contact and connection [17]. Digital technology may serve as a bridge for social connections and should be encouraged [6,36]. However, many individuals may lack access or the ability to take advantage of this.One resource that provides examples of how one can respond to patients or family members with different concerns or reactions is the COVID Ready Communication Playbook. This document guides clinicians on a range of topics specific to COVID-19, including helping patients and family members cope with a dire situation, as well as how clinicians can manage their own emotions.Family members of COVID-19 patients — In the context of physical distancing, most inpatient facilities have restricted or suspended visits by families and friends [37]. Family members of a loved one who is severely ill or dying will respond with grief. The treatment team should ask the family about thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to their loss, as well as provide grief counseling as warranted. (See ""Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features"" and ""Grief and bereavement in adults: Management"".)  Clinicians, patients with COVID-19, and their family should discuss end-of-life issues early in the course of management, especially if patients are elderly and suffering comorbidities. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"", section on 'End of life issues'.) Health care workers — Health care workers who directly treat patients with COVID-19 are at risk for psychiatric symptoms and disorders (see 'Health care workers' above). In treating these problems, mental health professionals should address potential sources of anxiety and distress, including [5,24,31,32]:  ●Access to personal protective equipment●High transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and risk of self-exposure and infection●Risk of exposing family members and others to infection●Access to testing for oneself and family members●Enforcement of infection control procedures in the workplace●Access to up-to-date, accurate information about COVID-19●Unclear communication from supervisors●Access to childcare during school closures●Increased and taxing workloads●Moral dilemmas and moral injury arising from situations such as deciding how to allocate insufficient resources, inadvertently placing others in danger, and implementing clinical decisions by others that one thinks are contrary to best practices●Loss of control/vulnerability ●Availability and use of support from colleagues and managers●Dying patients and grief-stricken family membersBased upon a study of clinicians (n = 466) in public hospital emergency departments in Hong Kong during the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic [38], the most frequent coping strategies included accepting the reality of the stressor, taking action to circumvent the stressor, and viewing the situation in a more positive light and attempting to grow from the situation.A follow-up study of hospital employees who were exposed to the 2003 SARS epidemic in Beijing (n = 549) found that higher levels of altruistic acceptance of risk during the outbreak (eg, “I want to help the patients and accept the risk”) were associated with lower levels of self-reported depressive symptoms three years later [27]. Quarantine — A review of 24 studies that examined the adverse psychological impact of quarantine suggested the following steps to mitigate the negative effects [23]: ●Explain the purpose of quarantine and how to implement it.●Voluntary quarantine is associated with less distress than mandatory quarantine.●Emphasize the altruistic benefit of quarantine in keeping others safe.●Facilitate acquisition of general (eg, food and housing) and medical supplies (eg, prescriptions, thermometers, and face masks).Suicidality — Interventions for managing suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) include the following [24]:●Treatments specific for suicidality (see ""Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"", section on 'Management')●Treating underlying psychiatric disorders by telehealth or in-person, depending upon the severity of suicidality●Encouraging patients to maintain social contact by telephone or computer, as well as face-to-face encounters that maintain physical distancing●Referring patients to social work for help in accessing financial safety nets (eg, food, housing, unemployment support, and loans)Specific disorders — Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, insomnia disorder, and PTSD that are associated with COVID-19 should follow recommendations for treating the general population of patients with these disorders and are discussed separately: ●(See ""Approach to treating generalized anxiety disorder in adults"".)●(See ""Approach to treating panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults"".)●(See ""Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"".)●(See ""Overview of the treatment of insomnia in adults"".)●(See ""Approach to treating posttraumatic stress disorder in adults"".)Schizophrenia — Pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for acute symptoms of schizophrenia that are associated with COVID-19 should follow recommendations for treating the general population of patients with schizophrenia and are discussed separately. (See ""Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Acute and maintenance phase treatment"" and ""Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia"".)Home visits — For patients with schizophrenia who are acutely ill with mild to moderate symptoms, daily home visits by clinicians and 24-hour coverage may be a reasonable alternative to inpatient hospitalization [33,39]. This allows patients to maintain physical distancing and home confinement, and thus avoid exposure to COVID-19. For patients with schizophrenia who are stable, home visits may be suitable to promote adherence to treatment and prevent relapse.Clozapine bloodwork — Patients receiving clozapine for schizophrenia or other serious mental illness typically require blood tests every one to four weeks to monitor absolute neutrophil counts. However, patients and clinicians need to decide whether the risks of COVID-19 outweigh the benefits of obtaining blood work. (See ""Guidelines for prescribing clozapine in schizophrenia"", section on 'Required bloodwork and coronavirus disease 2019'.)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.●General guidance from public health authorities (eg, World Health Organization or United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) – (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"".)●More detailed guidance for specialty care, including psychiatry – (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"", section on 'Psychiatry'.) ●Resources for psychiatric patients and their families – (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".) INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, “The Basics” and “Beyond the Basics.” The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on “patient info” and the keyword(s) of interest.) ●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")Patient education material is also available through the United States National Institute of Mental Health and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.SUMMARY●In one study from China, clinicians treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) developed moderate to severe psychiatric symptoms, including:•Anxiety – 12 percent•Depression – 15 percent•Insomnia – 8 percent•Distress – 35 percent(See 'Health care workers' above.)●The pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms and disorders that arise during the COVID-19 pandemic may include biologic and psychosocial factors. (See 'Pathogenesis' above.)●The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with psychiatric symptoms that do not necessarily rise to the level of a psychiatric disorder. In addition, the pandemic may lead to full-blown psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). During viral epidemics, psychiatric symptoms and disorders are more likely to occur in health care workers who are at relatively high risk of exposure, compared with workers who are at low risk of exposure. (See 'Clinical features' above.) ●Psychiatric problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic may persist for at least three years beyond the pandemic. In studies of a prior epidemic that assessed individuals 2.5 to 3 years after the epidemic, moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and PTSD were present in roughly 20 to 30 percent of individuals. In addition, the risk for persistent psychiatric symptoms and disorders was higher in health care workers and individuals who quarantined. (See 'Course of illness' above.) ●For individuals who experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or PTSD, stepped care may be an efficacious and cost-effective approach; surveillance of mental health problems is paramount. Those with low levels of symptoms are provided with self-help materials and are eligible to speak with a mental health professional if they have additional or persistent concerns. Individuals with moderate to severe symptoms can be treated by their primary care provider or a mental health specialist. (See 'General approach' above.)●Mental health professionals working with individuals who develop psychiatric issues related to COVID-19 should address potential sources of anxiety and distress, including access to personal protective equipment, risk of self-exposure and infection, risk of exposing others to infection, increased and taxing workloads, moral dilemmas, and patient deaths. (See 'Health care workers' above.)●The adverse psychological impact of quarantine may be mitigated by taking steps such as explaining the purpose of quarantine and how to implement it, as well as emphasizing the altruistic benefit of quarantine in keeping others safe. (See 'Quarantine' above.)●The hardships imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic may give rise to suicidal ideation and behavior. Individuals with moderate to severe distress, anxiety, or depression should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients with COVID-19 and patients with established psychiatric disorders should be encouraged to maintain social contact and to access treatment through telehealth or in-person.

ID:16722,N/A,medical,Practice Changing UpDates,"INTRODUCTION — This section highlights selected specific new recommendations and/or updates that we anticipate may change usual clinical practice. Practice Changing UpDates focus on changes that may have significant and broad impact on practice, and therefore do not represent all updates that affect practice. These Practice Changing UpDates, reflecting important changes to UpToDate over the past year, are presented chronologically, and are discussed in greater detail in the identified topic reviews.INFECTIOUS DISEASES (May 2020)Remdesivir in COVID-19●For hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, we recommend remdesivir, if available (Grade 1C).Remdesivir is an investigational antiviral agent under evaluation for COVID-19. Emerging data from randomized trials are limited and mixed. Interim analysis of an unpublished trial of >1000 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement suggested that remdesivir resulted in faster time to recovery (median 11 versus 15 days with placebo); a trend towards lower mortality was not statistically significant (8 versus 11.6 percent) [1]. In contrast, in a randomized trial from China of 237 patients with severe COVID-19, remdesivir and placebo had similar times to clinical improvement (median 21 versus 23 days) and mortality rates (14 versus 13 percent); however, confidence in the finding of no effect was reduced by use of concomitant therapies, differences in baseline comorbidities between the groups, and failure to meet the target enrollment [2]. Overall, if the preliminary results of the larger trial are confirmed, remdesivir likely has some clinical benefit, although the patient population most likely to benefit is uncertain. The United States Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19; if available, we recommend remdesivir for such patients and also refer them for trials of other agents, if concurrent remdesivir use is allowed. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"", section on 'Remdesivir'.)INFECTIOUS DISEASES (March 2020, Modified April 2020)One-time HCV screening for all adults ≥18 years●We suggest one-time screening for hepatitis C virus infection in all adults aged ≥18 years rather than selective screening (Grade 2C).In April 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that all adults ≥18 years be screened at least once for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [3]. The CDC recommendations differ from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations issued in March 2020, which included an upper age limit of 79 years for universal screening [4]. Previously, screening was recommended only for patients who had certain risk factors or were born during certain decades, but this approach results in many missed diagnoses. The improved efficacy, tolerability, and accessibility of antiviral treatment for HCV also support a broader screening strategy. We agree with the new CDC recommendation for broad one-time screening in all adults, and we continue to suggest repeat screening in individuals with ongoing risk factors (algorithm 1). (See ""Screening and diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"", section on 'Routine one-time screening for adults'.)ONCOLOGY (March 2020)Hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiation for treatment of brain metastases●For most patients undergoing whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for treatment of brain metastases, we suggest use of hippocampal avoidance intensity-modulated radiotherapy rather than conventional WBRT (Grade 2C). Patients with metastases within 5 mm of the hippocampi should receive conventional WBRT.For patients receiving whole brain radiation (WBRT) for brain metastases, neurocognitive decline is a feared complication that adversely impacts quality of life. Lowering the dose of radiation delivered to the hippocampi with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been suggested as a way to improve neurocognitive outcomes compared with conventional WBRT. In a randomized, unblinded trial in over 500 patients with brain metastases, the use of hippocampal avoidance IMRT (HA-IMRT) led to a 26 percent relative reduction in the risk of cognitive toxicity compared with conventional WBRT [5]. Patients in the HA-IMRT group reported less difficulty remembering things, less difficulty speaking, and greater improvement in fatigue at six months. Rates of brain control and overall survival were similar between groups, although confidence intervals were wide. All patients also received memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that was shown to reduce the risk of neurotoxicity in a previous trial. Based on these results, we now suggest HA-IMRT rather than conventional WBRT in most patients who require WBRT for treatment of brain metastases, and we administer memantine concurrently. (See ""Delayed complications of cranial irradiation"", section on 'Prevention'.)HEMATOLOGY (February 2020)Less chemoimmunotherapy for limited stage diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL) with no adverse features●For patients with limited stage (stage I or II) diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL) with no adverse features, we suggest four cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) rather than six or more cycles of R-CHOP, radiation therapy (RT) alone, or combined modality therapy (R-CHOP plus RT) (Grade 2C).Limited stage (stage I or II) diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL) without adverse risk factors (ie, no bulky disease, normal lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ECOG performance status 0-1) has an excellent prognosis when treated with the current standard approaches of either six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or three cycles of R-CHOP followed by radiation therapy (RT). To determine if less chemoimmunotherapy could achieve comparable outcomes with less toxicity, almost 600 patients ≤60 years with stage I-II DLBCL and no adverse risk factors were randomly assigned to four versus six cycles of R-CHOP [6]. With median follow-up greater than five years, there was less hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity with four cycles of R-CHOP, while three-year progression-free survival (PFS) and estimated five-year PFS and overall survival were similar compared with six cycles. We now suggest four cycles of R-CHOP for treatment of adults of any age with limited stage DLBCL and no adverse features. (See ""Initial treatment of limited stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma"", section on 'No adverse features'.)NEUROLOGY (December 2019)Tranexamic acid for adults with acute traumatic brain injury●For patients with moderate traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale greater than 8 and less than 13) presenting within three hours of injury, we recommend immediate administration of tranexamic acid (Grade 1B).Whether the antifibrolytic agent tranexamic acid benefits patients with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) was previously uncertain. In the CRASH-3 trial, which included over 9000 adults presenting within three hours of TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <13 or any evidence of intracranial bleeding on CT scan, those receiving tranexamic acid had a nonsignificantly lower rate of death related to head injury compared with placebo (18.5 versus 19.8 percent) [7]. However, this difference was statistically significant when patients with unreactive pupils were excluded (11.5 versus 13.2 percent) and in the subgroup of patients with mild to moderate TBI (5.8 versus 7.5 percent). Adverse events were similar between groups, including the rate of vaso-occlusive events. Based on these results, we now recommend tranexamic acid in patients with moderate TBI presenting within three hours of injury. Tranexamic acid may also be reasonable in other patient groups, such as those with severe TBI and reactive pupils or those with mild TBI (GCS >12) and intracranial bleeding, but a benefit is less certain in these patients. (See ""Management of acute moderate and severe traumatic brain injury"", section on 'Antifibrinolytic therapy'.)PEDIATRICS (November 2019)Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor for cystic fibrosis caused by the F508del variant●For patients age ≥12 years old with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the F508del variant, we suggest a triple therapy regimen (elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor) rather than dual therapy (tezacaftor-ivacaftor or lumacaftor-ivacaftor) (Grade 2B). For patients ≥12 years who have one F508del variant(heterozygotes), we suggest the triple therapy regimen rather than dual therapy or monotherapy with ivacaftor (Grade 2C).Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor is a combination cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulator designed to improve production and function of the defective CFTR protein in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by the F508del CFTR variant. Two recent studies evaluated this combination drug in differing populations:•In a randomized trial in >100 patients homozygous for the F508del variant, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor increased FEV1 at four weeks and improved respiratory symptoms compared with dual therapy (tezacaftor-ivacaftor) [8].•In a separate placebo-controlled randomized trial in >400 patients age ≥12 years who were heterozygous for the F508del variant and had a second minimal function variant (ie, producing no CFTR protein or a protein unresponsive to ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor), elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor increased the FEV1 after four weeks of treatment, decreased pulmonary exacerbations by >60 percent, improved respiratory symptoms, and reduced sweat chloride [9].The studies were the basis for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of this combination drug for patients ≥12 years with the F508del variant (homozygotes or heterozygotes with 508del and any other disease-causing CFTR variant). We now recommend CFTR modulator therapy for most patients with CF and suggest triple therapy for patients with who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del CFTR variant, representing almost 90 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis in the United States. (See ""Cystic fibrosis: Treatment with CFTR modulators"", section on 'Efficacy'.) HEMATOLOGY (November 2019)Lenalidomide for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma●For patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, we recommend treatment with single-agent lenalidomide or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone rather than observation (Grade 1B).Until recently, standard of care for patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) has been observation with systemic treatment deferred until progression to symptomatic disease. An earlier randomized trial demonstrated improved outcomes with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd), but concerns with the study design made extrapolation of the results difficult. In a second multicenter randomized trial of 182 patients with SMM, single-agent lenalidomide improved progression-free survival (PFS) and decreased end organ damage (eg, renal failure, bone lesions) when compared with observation [10]. Serious (grade 3/4) adverse events occurred in 41 percent of patients in the treatment arm; there was one treatment-related death in the phase II run-in and none in the randomized phase. On subgroup analysis, the PFS benefit was definitive in those with high-risk SMM but less clear in those with intermediate-risk disease. For patients with high-risk SMM by the Mayo 2018 20/2/20 criteria, we now recommend treatment with single-agent lenalidomide or Rd rather than observation (algorithm 2). More intensive regimens, or treatment for lower-risk SMM, should be reserved for patients enrolled in clinical trials. (See ""Smoldering multiple myeloma"", section on 'Management of high-risk SMM'.)CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE (October 2019)Dapagliflozin for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction●For patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who have persistent symptoms and an elevated serum natriuretic peptide level on optimal pharmacologic and device therapy, we recommend addition of dapagliflozin (versus no additional drug therapy) (Grade 1B).Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), but whether they improve outcomes for nondiabetic patients with HF has not been known. The DAPA-HF trial evaluated the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in nearly 5000 patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and an elevated natriuretic peptide level on optimal drug and device therapy [11]. Compared with placebo, all-cause mortality and the primary composite outcome (worsening HF or cardiovascular death) was reduced with dapagliflozin, with similar effects in patients with and without type 2 DM. The frequency of adverse effects was generally similar in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups. Given these findings, we now recommend dapagliflozin for patients with HFrEF with persistent symptoms and an elevated serum natriuretic peptide level despite optimal drug and device therapy (including a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and/or cardiac resynchronization therapy, if indicated). Dapagliflozin is contraindicated in patients with symptomatic hypotension or systolic blood pressure <95 mmHg, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, or rapidly declining renal function. (See ""Secondary pharmacologic therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in adults"", section on 'Evidence'.)OBSTETRICS, GYNECOLOGY AND WOMEN'S HEALTH (August 2019)New ACOG guidelines for preventing early-onset group B streptococcus infection in newborns●Universal screening of pregnant women for Group B streptococcal (GBS) colonization is now recommended at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation, rather than the previously recommended 35 to 37 weeks. Women with GBS bacteriuria any time in pregnancy or who had an infant with early-onset GBS infection in a previous pregnancy can be excluded from culture-based screening as they should routinely receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has released guidelines for prevention of early-onset group B streptococcus (GBS) infection in newborns, updating and replacing the obstetric portions of the 2010 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [12]. Among the revisions, a GBS rectovaginal screening culture is now recommended at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation rather than at 35 to 37 weeks. Cultures obtained more than five weeks before delivery are not predictive of GBS status at the time of birth, and the later screening window decreases the number of women who need to be recultured if they have not delivered by their due date. In addition, in selected women with unknown GBS status and a history of GBS colonization in a previous pregnancy, clinicians may offer intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics as part of a shared decision-making process rather than basing the decision to initiate antibiotics on intrapartum risk factors or results of rapid testing. (See ""Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: Prevention"", section on 'Culture-based approach'.)INFECTIOUS DISEASES (June 2019)Screening of US health care workers for latent tuberculosis infection●In US regions with a low incidence rate of tuberculosis (TB), health care workers in facilities where the tuberculin skin test conversion rate is low need not undergo routine serial TB testing following a baseline TB test. However, routine serial TB testing may be reasonable for those with increased risk for occupational exposure to TB (eg, pulmonologists, respiratory therapists, emergency department personnel), and institutional policies should be individualized.Annual screening of health care workers (HCWs) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has been a longstanding practice in the United States for prevention of tuberculosis (TB) transmission; however, the national incidence of TB has declined steadily over the past several decades, there is no evidence that annual screening reduces TB incidence, and testing has a number of limitations. Based on these factors, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) issued new guidelines in May 2019 stating that, following baseline screening, health care workers should not undergo routine annual screening [13]. We agree with this guidance, which serves as an update to the prior 2005 guidelines (table 1). Annual screening may be reasonable for HCWs at increased risk for occupational TB exposure (such as pulmonologists or respiratory therapists) or for HCWs in certain settings (such as emergency departments). Institutional policies should be individualized to incorporate these factors. (See ""Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults"", section on 'Health care workers'.)",2020-05-22 02:00:00,UPTODATE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
ID:127094,N/A,medical,Second-line systemic therapy for advanced exocrine pancreatic cancer,"INTRODUCTIONFor patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic exocrine pancreatic cancer, palliative systemic chemotherapy can improve disease-related symptoms and prolong survival. Options for second-line systemic therapy after progression on a first-line regimen will be reviewed here. Initial palliative systemic chemotherapy, specific methods for symptom palliation, and management of patients with metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine (islet cell) tumors are discussed separately. (See ""Initial systemic chemotherapy for advanced exocrine pancreatic cancer"" and ""Supportive care of the patient with locally advanced or metastatic exocrine pancreatic cancer"" and ""Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus and ganglia interventions"" and ""Metastatic well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: Systemic therapy options to control tumor growth and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion"".)",2020-05-22 02:00:00,UPTODATE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
ID:127551,N/A,medical,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Arrhythmias and conduction system disease,"INTRODUCTION — Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is designated COVID-19, which stands for ""coronavirus disease 2019"" [1]. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV.Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly. Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2,3]. Links to these and other related society guidelines are found elsewhere. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"", section on 'Society guideline links'.)This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of arrhythmias and conduction system disease in patients with COVID-19. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of other cardiac presentations (eg, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, etc) and noncardiac symptoms of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere: ●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Management in hospitalized adults"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Considerations in children"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Infection control in health care and home settings"".)●(See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Questions and answers"".)●(Related Pathway(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Initial telephone triage of adult outpatients.)Community-acquired coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are discussed separately. (See ""Coronaviruses"" and ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology"".)EPIDEMIOLOGY — The prevalence of arrhythmias and conduction system disease (and cardiovascular disease in general) in patients with COVID-19 varies from population to population. In most available reports, the specific cause of palpitations or type of arrhythmia have not been specified. Hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities, both known to contribute to the development of acute arrhythmias, have been frequently reported in the acute phase of severe COVID-19 illness; therefore, the exact contribution of COVID-19 infection to the development of arrhythmias in asymptomatic, mildly ill, critically ill, and recovered patients is not known [4]. ●In a multinational cohort of 8910 patients from Asia, Europe, and North America, 304 patients (3.4 percent) had a history of arrhythmia [5]. A history of arrhythmias was more than twice as common in patients who died from COVID-19 (6.8 versus 3.2 percent among survivors). ●In 137 subjects from Hubei province, 10 patients (7.3 percent) noted palpitations as one of the initial symptoms [6]. ●In a study of 138 patients from Wuhan who were hospitalized with COVID-19-related pneumonia, arrhythmias were reported in 17 percent of the general cohort and in 44 percent of patients admitted to an intensive care unit [7]. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSSigns and symptoms — Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. The most common clinical features reported at the onset of illness include fever (99 percent), fatigue (70 percent), dry cough (59 percent), anorexia (40 percent), myalgias (35 percent), dyspnea (31 percent), and sputum production (27 percent) [7]. Noncardiac manifestations of COVID-19 are discussed in detail separately. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of arrhythmias or conduction system disease. Patients may be tachycardic (with or without palpitations) in the setting of other illness-related symptoms (eg, fever, shortness of breath, pain, etc). The following observations have been reported from various cohorts:●In the cohort from Hubei province, 7.3 percent reported palpitations as a presenting symptom [6,8]. ●Among 4250 patients with COVID-19 from a multicenter New York cohort, 260 (6.1 percent) had QTc >500 milliseconds at the time of admission [9]. However, in another study of 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the baseline QTc was 435 milliseconds before taking these medications [10]. ●Among 393 patients with COVID-19 from a different New York cohort, atrial arrhythmias were more common among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (17.7 versus 1.9 percent) [11].●Among 187 patients with COVID-19 from a Chinese cohort, 11 patients (5.9 percent) had ventricular tachyarrhythmias while hospitalized [12]. ●Epidemiologic data from the Lombardi region of Italy show a nearly 60 percent increase in the rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the peak of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic (when compared with the same time frame from 2019) [13]. This could be related to COVID-19 infections, stress related to the pandemic, or delays in seeking medical attention by those with cardiac symptoms. It does not appear that there was increase in shockable rhythms, even in those who were suspected of or diagnosed with COVID-19. Other patients in whom arrhythmias may be seen include:●Patients who present with other cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection, such as myocardial injury or myocardial ischemia. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial infarction and other coronary artery disease issues"" and ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".) ●Patients with hypoxia, shock (septic or cardiogenic), or evidence of widespread systemic inflammation [14]. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues"".)●Patients with electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypokalemia) that predispose to the development of arrhythmias. (See ""Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults"", section on 'Cardiac arrhythmias and ECG abnormalities' and ""Hypomagnesemia: Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion"", section on 'Cardiovascular'.)●Patients who are receiving QT-prolonging therapies and who may develop polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). (See 'Patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes)' below.) ●Patients with fever, which can unmask cases of cardiac channelopathies such as Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome [15,16]. (See 'Brugada syndrome' below and ""Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations"".)Cardiovascular testingECG — Most patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected, and in particular patients with severe disease or in whom QT-prolonging medications will be used, should have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the time of entry into the health care system [17]. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single- or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring or multiple lead positions from a hand-held ECG device may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient [18]. This will allow for documenting baseline QRS-T morphology should the patient develop signs/symptoms suggestive of myocardial injury or an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the baseline ECG allows for documentation of the QT (and corrected QTc) interval. Importantly, QTc will need to be monitored if QT-prolonging therapies are initiated (eg, azithromycin, chloroquine, etc) to reduce the risk of acquired LQTS. (See ""Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"" and 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' below.)Continuous ECG monitoring — In the absence of documented cardiac arrhythmias, suspected myocardial ischemia, or other standard indications, continuous ECG monitoring is not required. However, as part of infection control mechanisms for patients with established or suspected COVID-19 infection, many hospitals are utilizing continuous ECG monitoring (in conjunction with automated blood pressure readings and oxygen saturation monitors) in lieu of standard vital sign checks by nursing staff. This practice reduces the number of clinical staff interacting with the patient, thereby reducing the risk to health care workers and preserving personal protective equipment. Transthoracic echocardiography — While some patients may develop cardiac manifestations, including myocardial injury, an initial transthoracic echocardiogram is not necessary for all patients. Providers may consider using a point-of-care ultrasound for a focused exam. (See ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Myocardial injury"".)DIAGNOSIS OF ARRHYTHMIAS — Arrhythmias are most commonly diagnosed from a combination of vital signs and review of the ECG, ideally a 12-lead ECG, but a rhythm strip can also be used. Tachycardias present with a pulse greater than 100 beats per minute, while most bradyarrhythmias present with a pulse less than 50 to 60 beats per minute. ●The most common arrhythmia overall in patients with COVID-19 is sinus tachycardia, but the most likely pathologic arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and monomorphic or polymorphic VT.●The differentiation between various tachycardias based on regularity (ie, regular or irregular) and QRS width (ie, narrow or wide QRS complex) requires only a surface ECG. (See ""Narrow QRS complex tachycardias: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to the diagnosis"".)●Bradyarrhythmias, including sinus pauses or high-grade heart block with slow escape rhythms, have not typically been seen but can be identified using a surface ECG if present. (See ""Sinus node dysfunction: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II"" and ""Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block"".)The diagnosis of acquired LQTS can be made in a patient with sufficient QT prolongation on the surface ECG in association with a medication or other clinical scenario (ie, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) known to cause QT prolongation. Ideally, the diagnosis is made following review of a full 12-lead ECG, but sometimes a single-lead rhythm strip is adequate if a full 12-lead ECG cannot be obtained. Acquired QT prolongation is typically reversible upon removal of the underlying etiology, such as discontinuation of an offending medication or correction of electrolyte derangements. (See 'Management' below.)Overall, the average QTc in healthy persons after puberty is 420±20 milliseconds. In general, the 99th percentile QTc values are 470 milliseconds in postpubertal males and 480 milliseconds in postpubertal females [19]. A QTc >500 milliseconds is considered highly abnormal for both men and women.MANAGEMENTPatients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes) — All patients with torsades de pointes (TdP) should have an immediate assessment of the symptoms, vital signs, and level of consciousness to determine if they are hemodynamically stable or unstable. Unstable patients — Patients with sustained TdP usually become hemodynamically unstable, severely symptomatic, or pulseless and should be treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms [20], including cardioversion/defibrillation (algorithm 1). Initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, with the exception of intravenous (IV) magnesium, is not indicated for hemodynamically unstable or pulseless patients. A full discussion of the standard approaches to basic life support and advanced cardiac life support is presented separately. (See ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"" and ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"".)Stable patients — Patients with TdP who are hemodynamically stable on presentation may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. As such, therapy should be promptly provided to most patients. A stable patient is one who typically shows no evidence of hemodynamic compromise but may have frequent, repetitive bursts of TdP. This patient should have continuous monitoring and frequent reevaluations due to the potential for rapid deterioration as long as the TdP persists. ●For patients with a single episode of TdP, treatment with IV magnesium along with correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements and/or removal of any inciting medications may be sufficient. The patient should be carefully monitored until electrolytes are normalized and the QT interval nearly normalizes.●For patients with multiple self-terminating episodes of TdP, the same therapies are utilized as in patients with a single episode (ie, IV magnesium, correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements, and/or removal of any inciting medications), along with additional interventions to increase the heart rate, which include overdrive pacing and/or IV isoproterenol infusion.Patients with other arrhythmias — The management of other arrhythmias in the setting of COVID-19 infection is no different from the routine management of these conditions without COVID-19 infection. Please refer to the following topics for management:Atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular tachycardias:●(See ""Overview of the acute management of tachyarrhythmias"".)●(See ""Overview of atrial fibrillation"".)●(See ""Overview of atrial flutter"".)●(See ""Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia"".)●(See ""Treatment of symptomatic arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome"".)●(See ""Focal atrial tachycardia"".) Monomorphic VT:●(See ""Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management"".)●(See ""Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: Treatment and prognosis"".)●(See ""Ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease"".) Conduction system disease:●(See ""Sinus node dysfunction: Treatment"".)●(See ""Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block"".)●(See ""Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II"".)●(See ""Temporary cardiac pacing"".)Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc) — While efficacy data are limited and generally inconclusive, many patients are being treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine [10,21,22], which are structurally similar to quinidine and have QT-prolonging effects by blocking activation of the potassium channel IKr (hERG/Kv11.1) [4,23,24]. Other medications with QT-prolonging effects may be tried for COVID-19 (table 1). In addition, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by CYP3A4, so other medications that inhibit this cytochrome could raise plasma levels [23]. The best available evidence highlights the potential for toxicity of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without an associated mortality benefit in patients with COVID-19. Among a multinational registry of 96,032 patients (from 671 hospitals on 6 continents) with COVID-19, 14,888 patients received treatment with chloroquine alone (n = 1868), chloroquine plus a macrolide (n = 3783), hydroxychloroquine alone (n = 3016), or hydroxychloroquine plus a macrolide (n = 6221), while 81,144 controls received none of these medications [22]. While there was no significant difference in the history of arrhythmia between any of the treatment groups and the control group (between 3.3 and 3.6 percent in all groups), de novo ventricular arrhythmia was rare in the control group (0.3 percent) but significantly more common in all treatment groups, as follows:●Chloroquine alone – 81 patients (4.3 percent; adjusted HR 3.6; adjusted HR 2.8-4.6)●Chloroquine plus macrolide – 246 patients (6.5 percent; adjusted HR 4.0; 95% CI 3.3-4.8)●Hydroxychloroquine alone – 184 patients (6.1 percent; adjusted HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.9-2.9)●Hydroxychloroquine plus macrolide – 502 patients (8.1 percent; adjusted HR 5.1; 95% CI 4.1-6.0)Monitoring for QT prolongation — The patient's baseline QTc value should be obtained prior to administering any drugs with the potential to prolong the QT interval [25]. The best method to obtain the QT interval is with a 12-lead ECG, but to reduce exposure to staff, this may not always be feasible. A single-lead ECG may underestimate the QT interval, and there should be an attempt to use a multiple-lead telemetry system to monitor the QT interval. There has been some outpatient use of hydroxychloroquine also, but there is no clear guidance regarding how to monitor these patients. Ambulatory ECG monitoring technologies, including the use of mobile or wearable technologies (eg, mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry), have been reported as reliable alternatives when the demand exceeds capacity for standard telemetry monitoring [26]. It is also important for patients being treated with QT-prolonging drugs to report promptly any new symptoms including palpitations, syncope, or near-syncope. They should also report clinical changes that could lead to hypokalemia, such as gastroenteritis or the initiation of diuretic therapy. In general, patients with the following QTc intervals are at low risk for significant QT prolongation and polymorphic VT:●QTc <460 milliseconds in prepubertal males/females●QTc <470 milliseconds in postpubertal males●QTc <480 milliseconds in postpubertal femalesPatients with baseline QTc interval ≥500 milliseconds (with a QRS ≤120 milliseconds) are at increased risk for significant QT prolongation and polymorphic VT [27]. In such patients, efforts should be made to correct any contributing electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and/or hypomagnesemia), with a goal potassium of close to 5 mEq/L. Even in those with a normal QT interval, there should be a review and discontinuation of any QT-prolonging medications that may not be essential to the immediate care of the patient (eg, proton pump inhibitors, etc) (table 1) [28]. In particular, when more than one QT-prolonging agent is being used simultaneously, we recommend one of the following approaches:●One protocol has been published from the Mayo Clinic, using the same QTc cutoffs as above [29]. If two to three hours after a dose of hydroxychloroquine or other QT-prolonging agent, the QTc increases to ≥500 milliseconds or if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds, there should be a reevaluation of the risk of TdP versus benefit of the medication, and the following steps should be taken:•Recognition that there is an increased risk of TdP.•Discontinuation of all other QT-prolonging medications.•Correction of all electrolyte abnormalities.•Place the patient on continuous telemetry, with consideration of a wearable defibrillator or placement of external defibrillator patches.•If TdP develops, then hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin or other medication should be stopped.●Another protocol proposes an ECG at baseline and again at four hours after hydroxychloroquine or other antiviral medication administration only if there is congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, patients are already taking other QT-prolonging medications, or patients have structural heart disease or bradycardia [23]. Another ECG can be completed one to three days later. For most others, an ECG or other QTc interval-monitoring method can be done 24 hours after starting the medication. If the QTc increases to ≥500 milliseconds, if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds, or if ventricular ectopy develops, this protocol recommends cardiology consultation. ●There has been a risk score developed in hospitalized patients for the prediction of QT interval prolongation, though not necessarily for the use of hydroxychloroquine [30,31]. It classifies patients as low, moderate, or high risk for TdP, which may allow for triaging whether continuous telemetry is needed while using the QT-prolonging medication, especially if there are limited resources and the patient could otherwise be followed as an outpatient. Signs of toxicity — There have also been anecdotal reports of toxicity associated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Doses of 5 gm of chloroquine will usually lead to death [32]. Symptoms typically occur in the first hour after ingestion, with seizures or cardiac arrest, as these medications are similar to quinidine, a sodium channel blocker. Cardiovascular toxicities include a widened QRS, prolonged QT interval, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, and hypotension. If ingestion is acute, activated charcoal may be used. In general, treatment involves epinephrine, high-dose diazepam, and repletion of potassium [33]. However, if too much potassium is given, there can be rebound hyperkalemia when there is intracellular shifting out of the cells. A bicarbonate IV infusion may be given, but there should be care in that it may lead to worsening hypokalemia. IV lipid emulsion has also been attempted in limited reports [34]. A local poison control center may be contacted for additional help. Brugada syndrome — Because there is an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of fever in those with Brugada syndrome, aggressive fever reduction with acetaminophen is imperative. High-risk patients, such as those with a spontaneous type 1 pattern ECG and prior syncope, might consider going to an emergency department if they have fever that cannot be promptly lowered with acetaminophen [23]. (See ""Brugada syndrome: Prognosis, management, and approach to screening"", section on 'Treatment'.)PROGNOSIS — Mortality rates appear to increase significantly with increasing age; case fatality rates <1 percent have been reported for those under 50 years of age, with rates approaching 15 percent for patients 80 years of age or older [35]. Similarly, mortality increases with disease severity, as there were no deaths reported among the mild or severe cases in the Chinese cohort, but mortality approached 50 percent among critically ill patients [35]. Underlying medical comorbidities appear to significantly impact COVID-19 severity and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and hypertension have been reported to have significantly high-case fatality rates compared with patients without these underlying comorbidities (10.5 and 6 percent mortality, respectively, compared with 0.9 percent mortality without underlying comorbidities) [35,36]. Similarly, patients in a multinational cohort who died from COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to have a history of cardiac arrhythmias [5].IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PROVIDERS CARING FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS — In addition to providing the best possible care for each patient, infection control to limit transmission is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 [4,37-41].Inpatient care and consultation — The approach to caring for hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 differs slightly, with the intent to reduce exposure to (and spread of) COVID-19 to health care providers. In general, the number of persons interacting directly with the patient and the time spent in the room should be minimized. Social distancing should be maintained, with both the patient and other members of the health care team. The following steps, when possible, will minimize exposure of personnel and limit the use of PPE:●For stable new admissions, the patient should be seen in person by the attending physician and at most one house officer or advanced practitioner (when applicable).●For stable patients on daily rounds, one person on the primary care team should enter the room to conduct the needed physical exam, with the rest of the team participating from outside the room via video chat or telephone.●Routine arrhythmia consultations, particularly in stable patients with ECG evidence documenting a specific arrhythmia or conduction disorder, can be completed without entering the patient's room by reviewing the available records and ECG monitoring data. ●Consider placing all patients on telemetry with concerns of arrhythmias, thereby reducing the need for in-room vital signs.●Utilize rooms with windows in the door to assist with monitoring patients from outside of the room. Patients can be contacted by telephone for routine matters without requiring entry into the room.Arrhythmia-related procedures — In order to maximize the available health care system resources to treat COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, while also minimizing the potential exposure of health care personnel to asymptomatic carriers of the virus, elective and nonurgent procedures should be postponed until a later date. A discussion of the reasoning behind the decision to postpone any procedure should be communicated to the patient and documented in the medical record. Conversely, urgent and semiurgent procedures should be performed when the perceived benefits of the procedure to the patient outweigh the risks of resource utilization and health care personnel exposure. Examples of the types of procedures in each category are as follows [4,37]: Urgent (substantial risk of decompensation, hospitalization, or death if the procedure is delayed):●VT ablation for medically uncontrolled electrical storm in a hemodynamically compromised patient.●Catheter ablation of incessant, hemodynamically significant, severely symptomatic tachycardia (supraventricular VT [SVT]/atrial fibrillation [AF]/atrial flutter) not responding to antiarrhythmic drugs, rate control, and/or cardioversion.●Catheter ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or preexcited AF with syncope or cardiac arrest.●Lead revision for malfunction in a pacemaker-dependent patient or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patient receiving inappropriate therapy.●Generator change in pacemaker-dependent patients who are at elective replacement indicator (ERI) or at device end of life. ●Pacemaker or ICD generator change with minimal battery remaining, depending on specific clinical situations.●Secondary prevention ICD.●Pacemaker implant for complete heart block, Mobitz II atrioventricular (AV) block, or high-grade AV block with symptoms or severe symptomatic sinus node dysfunction with long pauses.●Lead/device extraction for infection, including patients not responding to antibiotics for endocarditis, bacteremia, or pocket infection.●Cardiac resynchronization therapy in the setting of severe refractory heart failure in guideline-indicated patients.●Cardioversion for highly symptomatic atrial arrhythmias or rapid ventricular rates not controlled with medications.●Transesophageal echocardiogram for patients who need urgent cardioversion.Semiurgent (those procedures not deemed urgent but should be performed in a timely manner due to the clinical scenario): ●VT ablation for medically refractory recurrent VT. ●SVT ablation in patients with medically refractory SVT, resulting in emergency department visits. ●Cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) generator replacement for ERI battery status that is not urgent. ●Primary prevention ICD in patients at particularly high risk of life-threating ventricular arrhythmia. Nonurgent (those procedures that may be delayed for weeks or months):●Premature ventricular complex ablation. ●SVT ablation. ●AF and atrial flutter ablation in stable patients without heart failure, not at significant risk of getting hospitalized by delaying the procedure, or at high risk for procedure-related complications due to comorbidities. ●Electrophysiology testing to evaluate stable tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia. ●Primary prevention ICD that is not semiurgent. ●Cardiac resynchronization therapy in stable patients.●CIED upgrade. ●Pacemaker implant for sinus node dysfunction, Mobitz I AV block, other stable non-high-degree AV block, or tachy-brady syndrome in mildly symptomatic patients. ●Pacemaker or ICD generator replacements in patients with >6 weeks of battery remaining. ●Extraction of noninfected devices/leads unless device function is dependent on lead extraction and reimplant. ●Cardioversion for stable arrhythmias with well-tolerated symptoms. ●Left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in patients who can be on anticoagulation.●Transesophageal echocardiogram for routine assessment of valves or LAA closure devices and cardioversions that can be done after appropriate period of anticoagulation.●Implantable loop recorder implants.●Tilt-table testing.Perioperative cardiac implantable electrical device management — For patients with a CIED undergoing surgery or an endoscopic procedure, it is important to know if the patient is pacemaker dependent, if the patient has an ICD with therapies activated, and the likelihood of electromagnetic interference (EMI) during the procedure (eg, due to electrocautery, etc). In a patient with documented or suspected COVID-19 who is undergoing a procedure with a high likelihood of EMI that could result in pacemaker or ICD malfunction, application of a magnet may be used to suspend antitachyarrhythmia therapy in an ICD or to produce asynchronous pacing in a pacemaker [38]. This allows the patient to safely proceed with the necessary procedure without reprogramming the CIED before and after the procedure, thereby reducing the risk to health care personnel and preserving personal protective equipment (PPE).The standard approach to CIED management, which includes in-person reprogramming of the CIED before and after the procedure, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Perioperative management of patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"".)Cardiac implantable electrical device interrogations — For most patients, the majority of CIED follow-up device interrogations on modern-era devices can be done either in person or remotely. To maintain social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend remote CIED interrogations for the vast majority of stable patients [38].Certain situations remain, however, in which an in-person CIED interrogation may be the preferred option, including [4,38]:●Suspected CIED malfunction, including:•Inappropriate pacemaker pacing or sensing noted on ECG or telemetry monitoring.•Failure of ICD to deliver therapy during documented sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia.●Clinically actionable abnormality of CIED or suspicion of the device being at or near end of battery life, noted on remote monitoring, telemetry, or ambulatory monitoring.●ICD shocks, presyncope, or syncope concerning for an arrhythmic event to perform programming changes.●Untreated sustained ventricular arrhythmias in a patient with an ICD.●Evaluation of symptoms suspicious for arrhythmia or abnormal device function in patients who are not enrolled in remote monitoring.●Identified need for reprogramming of the CIED, or ICD patients whose device is delivering auditory or vibratory alerts.●Assessment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a patient with a stroke and no clear documentation of AF on ECG or telemetry monitoring.●For CIED patients requiring urgent or emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, consider performing a computed tomography scan instead if possible (to minimize the need for additional health care provider or device manufacturer representative contact); if not urgent, delay the MRI. ●Patients in the emergency department (or other setting) where remote monitoring is not available. Remote monitoring should be used wherever possible, including the option of asking family to bring the patient's home monitoring equipment to the hospital. After in-person CIED interrogation is performed, it is important to disinfect any parts of the programmer (eg, the programming wand and cord) that have been in contact with the patient. If available, disposable plastic wand coverings may be used to minimize contamination, and consideration should also be given to using a dedicated interrogation device in all settings with known or suspected COVID-19-positive patients. To reduce exposure of health care personnel to CIED patients, a doughnut magnet can be used as an alternative to a complete CIED interrogation or reprogramming [39]. When a hospitalized patient has a pacemaker that does not have remote monitoring capabilities, and proper function of the pacemaker is in question, temporary application of a doughnut magnet over the pacemaker is safe to quickly determine whether or not the pacemaker is capable of delivering pacing stimuli that can capture the heart. Magnet application will place the pacemaker in an asynchronous pacing mode. Depending on the manufacturer and programmed settings, this may include changes in the paced rate, which gives evidence of battery status (ie, elective replacement indicator) or whether there is pacemaker capture. In addition, demonstration of ventricular capture should provide basic reassurance that the pacemaker is functional and can avoid the need for a complete pacemaker interrogation. (See ""Perioperative management of patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"".)Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) — In general, basic life support and advanced cardiac life support for patients with COVID-19 should be administered in standard fashion, similar to patients without COVID-19, with the following exceptions [4,40] (see ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"", section on 'Resuscitation of patients with COVID-19'):●Any personnel caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate PPE before entering the room: gown, gloves, eye protection, and a respirator (eg, an N95 respirator). If supply of respirators is limited, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges that facemasks are an acceptable alternative (in addition to contact precautions and eye protection), but respirators should be worn during aerosol-generating procedures, which includes intubation. The appropriate PPE should all be donned prior to interacting with the patient, even if this leads to a delay in the provision of resuscitative care.●The number of people involved in the resuscitation should be kept to a minimum. This typically includes a team leader, anesthesiologist to manage the airway (if the patient is not already intubated), recorder/scribe, and persons to perform chest compressions, defibrillation, and administration of medications (often, these participants can rotate to allow for periods of rest after performing chest compressions).●In COVID-19 patients who are not yet intubated at the time of cardiac arrest, early intubation should be performed by the provider most likely to achieve success on the first pass, utilizing all readily available technology (eg, video laryngoscopy) to optimize first-pass success. Chest compression can be stopped during intubation, and intubation (with a cuffed endotracheal tube) can be performed prior to the standard two minutes of chest compressions and early defibrillation as a means of controlling the potential spread of airborne droplets.●If available, mechanical chest compression device may be used in place of manual compressions for adults and adolescents who meet minimum height and weight requirements.●For a critically ill patient who is already intubated and in the prone position at the time of arrest, CPR may be attempted with the patient prone by performing compressions with the hands over the T7/10 vertebral bodies. Defibrillation may be performed with the pads in the anterior-posterior position. The patient should be turned to the supine position for resuscitation only if able to do so without equipment disconnections that may lead to aerosolization of viral particles.●For out-of-hospital resuscitation efforts, lay rescuers should perform chest compression-only CPR while wearing a face mask or cloth covering. When available, an automated external defibrillator should be applied and used according to the usual protocol. (See ""Automated external defibrillators"" and ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"", section on 'Defibrillation'.)Initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, with the exception of IV magnesium, is not indicated for hemodynamically unstable or pulseless patients. A full discussion of the standard approaches to basic life support and advanced cardiac life support is presented separately. (See ""Basic life support (BLS) in adults"" and ""Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"".)SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – International and government guidelines for general care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Guidelines for specialty care"" and ""Society guideline links: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – Resources for patients"".)INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on ""patient info"" and the keyword(s) of interest.)●Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) overview (The Basics)"")SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS●The vast majority of patients presenting with a systemic illness consistent with COVID-19 will not have symptoms or signs of arrhythmias or conduction system disease. However, patients in whom arrhythmias may be seen include patients with myocardial injury, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, shock, electrolyte disturbances, or those receiving medications known to prolong the QT interval. (See 'Signs and symptoms' above.)●All patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected should have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the time of entry into the health care system. Ideally, this would be a 12-lead ECG, but a single-lead or multi-lead ECG from telemetry monitoring may be adequate in this situation to minimize staff exposure to the patient. Continuous ECG monitoring and echocardiography are not required in all patients but can be used in select situations. (See 'Cardiovascular testing' above.)●Patients with sustained torsades de pointes (TdP) usually become hemodynamically unstable, severely symptomatic, or pulseless and should be treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms, including cardioversion/defibrillation (algorithm 1). Patients with TdP who are hemodynamically stable on presentation may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. Treatment with intravenous (IV) magnesium along with correction of metabolic/electrolyte derangements and/or removal of any inciting medications may be sufficient, although patients with frequent recurrent episodes may require additional interventions. (See 'Patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes)' above.)●Patients receiving QT-prolonging medications should have a baseline QTc value obtained prior to administering the drugs. If the QTc subsequently increases to ≥500 milliseconds or if the change in QT interval is ≥60 milliseconds from the baseline ECG, the risk versus benefit of continued treatment with the QT-prolonging medication should be reassessed, with consideration of dose adjustment or additional intervention. (See 'Patients receiving QT-prolonging treatments (eg, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, etc)' above.)●The approach to caring for hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 differs slightly, with the intent to reduce exposure to (and spread of) COVID-19 to health care providers. In general, the number of persons interacting directly with the patient and the time spent in the room should be minimized. Social distancing should be maintained, with both the patient and other members of the health care team. (See 'Inpatient care and consultation' above and 'Arrhythmia-related procedures' above.)●The approaches to cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) interrogations and perioperative CIED management are summarized in the text. Strategies to avoid in-person device interrogations should be deployed. (See 'Cardiac implantable electrical device interrogations' above and 'Perioperative cardiac implantable electrical device management' above.)●In general, basic life support and advanced cardiac life support for patients with COVID-19 should be administered in standard fashion as for patients without COVID-19. However, any personnel caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (including gown, gloves, eye protection, and a respirator or face mask) before entering the room, the number of people involved in the resuscitation should be kept to a minimum, and early intubation should be performed for patients who are not yet intubated at the time of cardiac arrest. (See 'Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)' above.)",2020-05-22 02:00:00,UPTODATE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

The key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. We sought to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique. It was found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19. There was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1β+ monocytes in the ERS. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the naïve B cells decreased. Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development were confirmed. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1β and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.",2020-05-04 00:00:00,NATURE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential. In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections. Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response. Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses. Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction. Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses. The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances. Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery. For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment. The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted. The participation in international COVID-19 cancer registries is greatly encouraged.",2020-05-22 00:00:00,NATURE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT–PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT–PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT–PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT–PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.",2020-05-19 00:00:00,NATURE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

Several studies report outcomes of COVID-19 in predominately well persons. There are also some data on COVID-19 in persons with predominately solid cancer but controversy whether these persons have the same outcomes. We conducted a cohort study at two centres in Wuhan, China, of 128 hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers, 13 (10%) of whom developed COVID-19. We also studied 226 health care providers, 16 of whom developed COVID-19 and 11 of whom were hospitalised. Co-variates were compared with the 115 subjects with haematological cancers without COVID-19 and with 11 hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. There were no significant differences in baseline co-variates between subjects with haematological cancers developing or not developing COVID-19.

Case fatality rates were 62% (32, 85%) and 0 (0, 32%; P = 0.002). Hospitalised persons with haematological cancers have a similar case rate of COVID-19 compared with normal health care providers but have more severe disease and a higher case fatality rate.

While guidance from international associations is continuously being updated, all facets of care of neonates born to women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are center-specific, given local customs, building infrastructure constraints, and availability of protective equipment. Based on anecdotal reports from institutions in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic close to our hospital, together with our limited experience, in anticipation of increasing numbers of exposed newborns, we have developed a triage algorithm at the Penn State Hospital at Milton S.

Several studies have now established that the hyperinflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. Macrophages are a population of innate immune cells that sense and respond to microbial threats by producing inflammatory molecules that eliminate pathogens and promote tissue repair. However, a dysregulated macrophage response can be damaging to the host, as is seen in the macrophage activation syndrome induced by severe infections, including in infections with the related virus SARS-CoV.

Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples. Clinical, analytical, and radiographic findings were registered.ResultsRT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (five out of seven). The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1–10). Fever was the most frequent symptom (six out of seven). The second most common symptom was asthenia (four out of seven), followed by dyspnea, cough, and expectoration (three out of seven for each symptom).

Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells. Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present. Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.",2020-04-27 00:00:00,NATURE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-04-22 00:00:00,NATURE,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

DOI:10.7326/M20-2306,10.7326/M20-2306,Reviews,"Ventilation Techniques and Risk for Transmission of Coronavirus Disease, Including COVID-19: A Living Systematic Review of Multiple Streams of Evidence","As of 18 May 2020, the ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 4.8 million individuals worldwide and caused over 300 000 deaths (1). SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person to person through close contact and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); most deaths are caused by development of hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and supportive therapies are the mainstays of treatment of ARDS. Noninvasive ventilation is associated with fewer adverse outcomes for patients than is IMV. However, NIV creates risks for the health care workers (HCWs) caring for these patients, because of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via aerosols (2). The magnitude of this risk is not well explored in COVID-19. In contrast, IMV typically uses a closed system and thus carries a much lower risk for transmission via aerosols. Countries with large number of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation have experienced shortage of ventilators and have relied on NIV, which includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula (HFNC). Guidelines vary considerably in their recommendations on the role and optimal method of NIV, reflecting                     differences in assumed effectiveness balanced with the risk for infection to HCWs from aerosols. Hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS are common in COVID-19, but the ideal way of providing ventilation and the effect of NIV on HCWs is uncertain. Although they are different from other causes of ARDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (caused by SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (caused by MERS-CoV) may resemble ARDS in COVID-19 (3, 4). Thus, evidence from SARS and MERS may be useful to explore the effects of NIV. Commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) to inform their guidance documents, we urgently but systematically reviewed evidence to assess the benefits and harms of alternate noninvasive and invasive ventilation strategies in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. This included searching for indirect evidence (for example, that related to SARS and MERS) and for evidence on the effect of virus transmission on HCWs. By agreement with WHO on 3 April 2020, we performed an urgent systematic review to compare the effect of different ventilation techniques on important patient outcomes and the risk for transmission for coronavirus disease, including COVID-19. We adhered to Cochrane systematic review methods, rated the certainty of evidence by following the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach, prospectively registered the review on PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020178187) (Supplement 1), and followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines (5–9). We assembled a large international collaborative team of researchers, frontline and specialist clinicians, epidemiologists, patients, public health experts, and health policy experts with expertise in                     systematic reviews. The review addresses the following 4 streams of evidence: 1) studies of any design that addressed NIV for individuals with acute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by coronavirus (COVID-19, MERS, SARS); 2) systematic reviews of randomized trials that assessed the efficacy of NIV approaches in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure not due to coronavirus infection; 3) animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus; and 4) studies in adults evaluating risk for virus transmission to HCWs from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). When possible, results focus on information most relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Information related to the first stream of evidence will be continually updated and maintained as a living systematic review for at least 1 year.",2020-05-22 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
DOI:10.7326/M20-2567,10.7326/M20-2567,Ideas and Opinions,"Cloth Masks May Prevent Transmission of COVID-19: An Evidence-Based, Risk-Based Approach","Physical distancing, hand hygiene, and disinfection of surfaces are the cornerstones of infection control during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. At the same time, governments, international agencies, policymakers, and public health officials have been debating the validity of recommending use of nonmedical masks by the general public to reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We believe that these decisions should be informed by evidence. Although no direct evidence indicates that cloth masks are effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the evidence that they reduce contamination of air and surfaces is convincing and should suffice to inform policy decisions on their use in this pandemic pending further research. Cloth does not stop isolated virions. However, most virus transmission occurs via larger particles in secretions, whether aerosol (<5 µm) or droplets (>5 µm), which are generated directly by speaking, eating, coughing, and sneezing; aerosols are also created when water evaporates from smaller droplets, which become aerosol-sized droplet nuclei. The point is not that some particles can penetrate but that some particles are stopped, particularly in the outward direction. Every virus-laden particle retained in a mask is not available to hang in the air as an aerosol or fall to a surface to be later picked up by touch. Filtration efficiency is the ability of a material to block transmission; it is expressed as a percentage (Figure) and assessed using surrogate markers, including biological aerosols. Mask standards set by ASTM International require tests with latex spheres and aerosolized Staphylococcus aureus (1), but masks are not assessed separately for every pathogen: Filtration efficiency depends on the physical retention of particles of different sizes, regardless of which pathogen the particle contains. For consistency, we calculated FE from data provided in the original work rather than presenting the data in the units chosen by the authors. PF and fit factor are synonyms. FE = filtration efficiency; PF = protection factor; TIL = total inward leakage. Cloth can block droplets and aerosols, and layers add efficiency. Filtration efficiency for single layers of different types of cotton cloth in a bioaerosol (0.2 µm) experiment was between 43% and 94%, compared with 98% to 99% for fabric from disposable medical masks (2). In a summary of similar observations, single layers of scarfs, sweatshirts, T-shirts, and towels were associated with filtration efficiency of 10% to 40% in experiments using NaCl aerosol (0.075 µm) (3). For tea towel fabric, studied with aerosol-sized particles, filtration efficiency in experiments using a bacterial marker was 83% with 1 layer and 97% with 2 layers, compared with 96% for a medical mask (4).

On streets devoid of their typical pedestrian and vehicular traffic, the noise carries far, attracting the attention of millions of New Yorkers sheltering in place. Enticed by its allure, others soon join in. As the volume rises, the constant daytime blaring of ambulance sirens is temporarily forgotten. Everyone has a different role to play: while some bang pots and pans outside of their windows, others play music from their balconies. Drivers honk their car horns. Everybody is cheering. The melodies harmonize, and what began as a scattered cacophony soon becomes an orchestra. The skies fill with encouragement as tenants from townhouses and residential towers alike join in. The energy is electric. For a few minutes, the gloom that has overtaken the city is cast aside. Yet, the peak soon passes and is succeeded by a disheartening decrescendo. Cookware disappears, songs end, and cars scatter. Cheers die down, replaced by the eerie silence of a city laid low by a black swan. Neighbors retreat to the safety of their apartments.

An invisible enemy has broken through the ranks of our global society and is waging an aggressive campaign. Hospitalists are on the front lines defending our health and safety. As with other pandemics, coronavirus disease 2019 presents challenges for the well-being of citizens around the globe, resulting from fear of illness, social distancing measures, isolation and quarantines, and protracted uncertainty (1). Hospitalists and other health care workers face additional unique challenges. A transition to crisis standards of care requiring allocation of scarce resources, proximity to infected patients, concerns about bringing the infection home to family members, societal stigma, and changing procedures are creating an unprecedented strain. China, the outbreak epicenter, has already seen adverse mental health effects on health care professionals, with high rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and general distress reported                         (2). Ensuring the well-being of hospitalists at the leading edge of our health care response requires action by organizational leaders, and health care personnel alike, to preserve our most important assets in this global battle. Interventions to enhance the well-being and functioning of hospitalists and other health care workers during extreme times of stress should use the principles of psychological first aid, an evidence-based framework that enhances a sense of safety, calming, hope, self- and organizational efficacy, and social connectedness (3). During crises, leadership decisions and behaviors have a profound effect on the functioning and psychological well-being of personnel (4). Throughout health care practices, there are leaders of clinical and administrative teams and services as well as higher levels of facilities and organizations. All of these leaders have the potential to make critical contributions to the well-being of personnel during this crisis and the subsequent recovery. Leaders should prioritize the wellness and sustainment of health care professionals through prevention efforts to reduce psychological morbidity during outbreaks using psychological first aid principles (5). The following are steps that leaders can take to support their workforce and sustain patient care: Be present. This provides reassurance and a “1 team, 1 fight” approach. Take time to connect and communicate with your personnel. Communicate effectively. Information treats anxiety in a crisis. Share what you know and what you don't know. Commit to finding answers and then share them with the team. Ensure training and equipment. Obtain needed equipment and ensure training in its use. Address anticipated exposures. Speak up and take action when personnel safety is at risk.",2020-04-21 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

Studies suggest that many patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome experience a cytokine storm characterized by fever; hyperferritinemia; and a massive release of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and monocyte chemoattractant proteins (1). These findings led to the hypothesis that biological agents targeting specific cytokine or inflammatory pathways may improve the respiratory outcomes of patients with the most severe forms of COVID-19 (2). Objective: To describe a patient with COVID-19 and overt hemophagocytic syndrome whose response to treatment was consistent with this hypothesis. Case Report: A 51-year-old man who had received a kidney transplant was referred to our intensive care unit for cough, fever, and shortness of breath leading to the presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19. On day 1, acute respiratory failure required mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Therapy with dexamethasone (5 mg twice daily), ceftriaxone (2 g/d), and spiramycin (1.5 million units 3 times daily) was initiated. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were withdrawn. On day 2, the patient developed refractory multiorgan failure characterized by an inflammatory state, heart failure, stage 3 acute-on-chronic kidney injury, acute liver failure, nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lactic acidosis. The C-reactive protein level was 262 mg/L, and the ferritin level was 52 005 μg/L. We considered a diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome because the patient had underlying immunosuppression; fever of 39 °C; a serum ferritin level above                     6000 μg/L; a hemoglobin level below 92 g/L; a platelet count below 110 × 109 cells/L; high levels of serum triglycerides; and aspartate aminotransferase with an HScore of 253, which indicated that the probability of having hemophagocytic syndrome was 99.5% (3). Bone marrow aspiration and liver biopsy confirmed the presence of hemophagocytosis (Figure).

DOI:10.7326/M20-1515,10.7326/M20-1515,Reviews,Risks and Impact of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin-Receptor Blockers on SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Adults: A Living Systematic Review,"Concerns exist that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) increase susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the viral agent that causes the disease COVID-19) and the likelihood of severe COVID-19 illness (1). Early reports from Wuhan, China, showed that hypertension and diabetes were common among patients with COVID-19 and were associated with worse outcomes (2). Although these early studies did not specify whether patients were using ACEIs or ARBs before becoming infected, these medications are widely used to treat hypertension and diabetes (3, 4). The proposed mechanism by which ACEIs and ARBs may play a role in COVID-19 is through upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is presumed to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry to host cells (5) (Figure 1). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 exists primarily as a membrane-bound monocarboxypeptidase with robust expression in such tissues as lung, vasculature, intestine, and kidney (5). A soluble or circulating form of ACE2 (sACE2) has cardiovascular effects in the renin–angiotensin system (6–8). Related to viral pathogenesis, sACE2 was shown to block SARS viral entry into cells (9) and is now being considered as a potential therapy (10).  As part of the RAS, ACE2 (green) regulates the levels of angiotensin II. As the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 may facilitate viral entry into cells. This figure illustrates the role of ACE2 in the RAS and how pharmacologic RAS blockade with ACEIs or ARBs (red) could theoretically increase the amount of ACE2 available for viral binding. ACE2 = angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ACEI = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB = angiotensin-receptor blocker; AT1 = type 1 angiotensin receptor; RAS = renin–angiotensin system; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is distinct and not directly related to the clinical use of ACEIs or ARBs, or to their mechanisms of action. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors target angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE) to inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby reducing levels of angiotensin II available to bind and activate the type 1 angiotensin receptor (AT1), which mediates most of the vasopressor effects of angiotensin II (11). Angiotensin-receptor blockers work by binding to AT1 receptors and directly blocking the actions of angiotensin II. In contrast to ACE, which acts to generate angiotensin II, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7) and is thus a negative regulator of the renin–angiotensin system (Figure 1) (12).",2020-05-15 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

DOI:10.7326/M20-3255,10.7326/M20-3255,Editorials,Thromboembolic Findings in COVID-19 Autopsies: Pulmonary Thrombosis or Embolism?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initially presented as pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent in January 2020 (1). Since then COVID-19, with its pulmonary and other systemic manifestations, has spread globally—with more than 4.2 million cases and over 291 000 deaths in 187 countries reported (2). With spread of disease, abnormal coagulation variables with high incidence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) complications have been noted, raising the need to develop specific VTE diagnostic and therapeutic strategies (3). Complete autopsy studies were almost nonexistent in the initial phases of the outbreak; reasonably so, due to concerns related to infectivity, transmission rates, and biosafety. The few reports initially published were limited to postmortem biopsies in COVID-19–positive patients (4–6) or from lobectomy specimens initially resected for lung adenocarcinoma, but patients were later found to be COVID-19–positive (7). Pathologic features of exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) were noted in these initial reports and overlapping features with SARS were also noted. Later complete autopsies performed in United States further supported the presence of DAD (8, 9). More recently, Wichmann and colleagues (10) reported the findings of 12 consecutive, legally mandated autopsies of patients with COVID-19. The authors noted a high incidence of pulmonary embolism with or without underlying deep venous thrombosis, despite the absence of history of VTE. Massive pulmonary embolism was the cause of death in one third of the cases, with an additional one fourth with recent deep venous thrombosis but without pulmonary embolism. Seventy-five percent were men and two thirds of these were noted to have recent thrombosis in prostatic venous plexus. Preexisting coronary heart disease (50%), respiratory tract, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were noted but an absence of antemortem VTEs. Histologically exudative phase DAD was noted in two thirds and presence of pulmonary thrombi in 5 out of 8 cases with DAD. Similar histologic findings of DAD with microthrombi in 45% cases were also recently reported by Menter and associates in a series of 21 COVID-19–positive autopsies, 4 with prominent central pulmonary embolism (11). In this issue, Lax and colleagues (12) report the findings of autopsies performed on 11 patients randomly selected among 48 hospitalized COVID-19–positive decedents. Significant preexisting comorbid conditions included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, cancer, as well as history of cerebrovascular disease (ischemic stroke in 4 patients) and pulmonary embolism (1 patient). After autopsy tissue fixation, grossly visible pulmonary thrombi were noted in all cases with associated infarcts in 9 out of these 11 (81%) autopsies. During their hospital stay, 10 of the 11 deceased patients had received prophylactic dose anticoagulant therapy, with 2 receiving this therapy even before admission; thus suggesting that pulmonary thrombi were formed despite anticoagulant therapy. Apart from DAD, histologic evaluation highlighted the presence of multiple thrombi in small to mid-sized pulmonary arteries with adjacent lung parenchymal infarcts. These autopsy studies highlight the importance of thromboembolic events in COVID-19. Wichmann and colleagues highlighted the high incidence of pulmonary embolism with or without deep venous thrombosis, as well as presence of recent thrombi in prostatic venous plexus, in patients with no history of VTE, suggesting de novo coagulopathy in these patients with COVID-19. In contrast, Lax and colleagues highlighted changes consistent with thrombosis occurring within the pulmonary arterial circulation, in the absence of apparent embolism.",2020-05-15 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
DOI:10.7326/M20-1982,10.7326/M20-1982,Ideas and Opinions,The New Normal: Key Considerations for Effective Serious Illness Communication Over Video or Telephone During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,"On 4 March 2019, a year before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic descended on the United States, a doctor delivered difficult news to a 78-year-old man who was in the intensive care unit with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1). His granddaughter, sitting beside him, recorded the interaction on her cellphone. First, we see the nurse roll in a piece of equipment with a screen. She attends to other tasks in the patient's room while a man on the screen—the doctor—begins to speak. We hear only parts of what he says: damage to the man's lungs cannot be fixed; morphine may help him feel better. The granddaughter asks her grandfather if he understands; we cannot hear his response. The clip ends. The man died the next day. His family, deeply dissatisfied with the interaction, released the video to the press, and articles with titles like “Doctor delivers end-of-life news via robot” were broadly                     disseminated. Fast forward to now. Across the country, clinicians are using telecommunication (by video or telephone) for serious illness communication with hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and their loved ones, together or separately. The term serious illness communication refers to communication between clinicians and patients about prognosis, goals, values, priorities, and recommendations for goal-concordant treatment plans (2). The pandemic brings new barriers to effective serious illness communication: widespread fear and uncertainty, surging work demands for clinicians, and the clinically appropriate but unfamiliar use of telecommunication to reduce exposure to the virus and preserve personal protective equipment. Here, we discuss how frontline clinicians can have meaningful conversations with patients who are seriously ill and their loved ones using telecommunication during this extraordinary time (Table). Serious illness communication, whether in person or by telecommunication, requires careful preparation. Clinicians should assess the patient's ability to participate, their need for a translator, and their preferences to include loved ones. An advantage of telecommunication is that loved ones can be included from a distance. A review of prior advance care planning documentation can identify legal decision makers and guide decision making when patients cannot participate. If using video, clinicians should ensure patients can use the equipment; some hospitals have engaged volunteers to help with this. If possible, a clinician should conduct visits from a private space where they can remove their mask and preserve the patient's privacy. Clinicians should identify hearing and vision impairment and adjust their environment and communication accordingly (Table). Finally, clinicians should start the actual conversation by checking in with                     themselves first—especially now with the distractions of the pandemic. A deep breath brings one into the present to focus on the needs of the patient and family. Serious illness communication requires rapid establishment of rapport and trust, which can be challenging over video or telephone (8), especially in the context of shift work and rotating clinicians. Clinicians can foster continuity by including a nurse or staff member who regularly works with the patient or an established primary care provider. Some clinicians have been redeployed as family liaisons to provide regular medical updates during the hospital stay; these liaisons can be included (9). Whenever possible, we suggest having several brief conversations rather than 1 prolonged meeting. An initial conversation without urgent decision making allows participants to adjust to telecommunication, troubleshoot technologic glitches, and begin to build rapport. Even for urgent conversations, a few minutes spent chatting about a patient's interests or background can quickly build rapport. To further build trust,                     clinicians should acknowledge that telecommunication is not optimal. If patients or family members express disappointment, clinicians can use “I wish” statements (for example, “I wish I could be there in person to support you.”). Clinicians should be mindful to demonstrate that they are listening by making eye contact with the camera, not the device screen, and giving brief verbal responses (“yes…” or “go on…”). Before the conversation, clinicians should consider their agenda: Is the communication task information sharing, providing emotional support, identifying goals and values, or decision making? Many open-source, step-by-step frameworks, some specific to COVID-19, have been disseminated, including guides to breaking bad news, identifying goals of care, and advance care planning (3–6). An advantage of telecommunication is that clinicians can have a framework up on their screen as a cheat sheet during ongoing conversations, which may be especially helpful for clinicians new to serious illness communication. However, we caution clinicians to avoid strict adherence to algorithms and to remain flexible. Asking permission at regular points in the conversation provides natural transitions, builds psychological safety, and allows patients and families some control. For example, a clinician can ask, “May I                     tell you what I understand about how your father is doing today?” Likewise, clinicians should regularly check for understanding, use summarizing statements, and orient back to patients when loved ones are also in the conversation.",2020-05-14 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
DOI:10.7326/M20-2566,10.7326/M20-2566,Original Research,"Pulmonary Arterial Thrombosis in COVID-19 With Fatal Outcome: Results From a Prospective, Single-Center, Clinicopathologic Case Series","The pandemic spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, within a few months, led to a global health and economic crisis (1–3). COVID-19 is usually characterized by symptoms of acute respiratory infection, such as fever, headache, dry cough, and shortness of breath, but may show further symptoms involving the gastrointestinal tract (gastroenteritis-like, with vomiting and diarrhea, or a hepatitis-like picture) and the central nervous system (most notably anosmia) (4–8). Only a small subset of infected individuals becomes severely ill, requiring intensive care and with risk for death, but this number may increase dramatically through the high transmission rate of the virus (8–10). Although advanced age                     and certain comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases, have been identified as risk factors for adverse outcome and death, the individual clinical course can be highly unpredictable and dynamic, with rapid deterioration of the respiratory and hemodynamic condition (10–14). So far, very little is known about the pathologic findings underlying the clinical presentation of severe COVID-19. Only a few reports on surgical specimens and autopsy cases have been published over the past few months, and detailed information is still limited (15–17) and was in part obtained by postmortem core biopsies (18, 19). More insights from autopsies have become available from the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, showing that patients with fatal outcome predominantly had diffuse alveolar damage characterized by edema, hyaline membranes, and proliferation of pneumocytes and fibroblasts (20). Nevertheless, the pattern of organ damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 and occurring in patients with COVID-19 is still incompletely understood. In light of the currently limited options for effective antiviral treatment, it may be critical                     to better understand the morphologic basis for severe and fatal COVID-19 outcomes (21). The aim of this detailed autopsy study was to unravel the clinicopathologic basis for adverse outcomes in patients with a fatal course of COVID-19 by evaluating the gross and microscopic findings in correlation with their clinical phenotypes. We used a prospectively designed systematic approach to perform the autopsies and to study organ changes macro- and microscopically and relate them to key clinical features. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive and systematic clinicopathologic evaluation of key multiorgan involvement and failure in COVID-19. The study was prospectively designed, and all autopsies on patients with COVID-19 in our hospital were done according to the same protocol. The Hospital Graz II is the second largest public and academic teaching hospital in the region of Styria, Austria (1.2 million inhabitants) and was designated the COVID-19 center of the region at the beginning of the outbreak of the pandemic. From 28 February to 14 April 2020, 242 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our hospital, of whom 48 died. Autopsy was performed in 11 of the 48 deceased patients (23%), of whom 10 were selected at random; in 1 case, the treating intensive care specialist requested autopsy. The number of patients randomly selected for autopsy was influenced by the daily number of deceased patients, together with our infrastructural, time, and personnel constraints. There were no medical exclusion criteria. According to federal Austrian hospital law, an autopsy in a public hospital is mandatory without requirement of an informed consent by the relatives when the cause of death is unclear, scientific or public interest is present, or health                         authorities or a court order the autopsy. Nevertheless, religious reasons or an explicit wish from the patients' relatives to abstain from autopsy would be respected, if possible. In this study, autopsy was performed in accordance with the law owing to the unknown cause of death, and to both scientific and public interest in a novel disease. No informed consent was obtained from the families. All performed procedures and investigations were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.",2020-05-14 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
DOI:10.7326/M20-1495,10.7326/M20-1495,Original Research,Variation in False-Negative Rate of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction–Based SARS-CoV-2 Tests by Time Since Exposure,"Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are often used to “rule out” infection among high-risk persons, such as exposed inpatients and health care workers. Hence, it is critical to understand how the predictive value changes in relation to time since exposure or symptoms, especially when using the results of these tests to make decisions about whether to stop using personal protective equipment or allow exposed health care workers to return to work. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 are poorly characterized, and the “window period” after acquisition in which testing is most likely to produce false-negative results is not well known. Accurate testing for SARS-CoV-2, followed by appropriate preventive measures, is paramount in the health care setting to prevent both nosocomial and community transmission. However, most hospitals are facing critical shortages of SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity, personal protective equipment, and health care personnel (1). As the epidemic progresses, hospitals increasingly have to decide how to respond when a patient or health care worker has a known exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Although 14 days of airborne precautions or quarantine would be a conservative approach to minimizing transmission per guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2), this is not feasible for many hospitals given starkly limited resources. As RT-PCR–based tests for SARS-CoV-2 are becoming more available, they are increasingly being used to “rule out” infection to conserve scarce personal protective equipment and preserve the workforce. When exposed health care workers test negative, they may be cleared to return to work; similarly, when exposed patients test negative, airborne or droplet precautions may be removed. If negative results from tests done during the window period are treated as strong evidence that an exposed person is SARS-CoV-2–negative, preventable transmission could occur. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative results from tests done early in the course of infection. The goal of our study was to estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection. As part of a broader effort to provide critical evaluation of emerging evidence, the Novel Coronavirus Research Compendium at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health did a literature review to identify preprint and peer-reviewed articles on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics (3). Investigators searched PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a strategy detailed in Supplement Table 1. The search was last updated on 15 April 2020. From the broader search, we identified articles that provided data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or exposure using samples derived from nasal or throat swabs among patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. Inclusion criteria were use of an RT-PCR–based test, sample collection from the upper respiratory tract, and reporting of time since symptom onset or exposure. We excluded articles that did not clearly define time between testing and symptom onset or exposure. We identified 7                         studies (2 preprints and 5 peer-reviewed articles) (4–10) with a total of 1330 respiratory samples analyzed by RT-PCR. Figure 1 summarizes the source data.

DOI:10.7326/M20-1774,10.7326/M20-1774,Ideas and Opinions,COVID-19 and Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy: The Need to Protect Vulnerable Medicare Beneficiaries,"In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started an epidemic in Wuhan, China, that has since spread throughout the world. Now called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. Reports from China showed that older age is a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (1). In Washington state, an initial epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States, nursing home residents were one of the most heavily affected populations and had high mortality rates, highlighting COVID-19's ability to spread rapidly in such settings (2). Other risk factors for worse outcomes include an immunocompromised state, underlying structural lung disease, cardiac disease, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes (3). Each of these comorbid conditions is common in persons receiving outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT), making this group a high-risk population. However, current payment policy under Medicare could lead to unintended consequences for patients receiving OPAT, including exposure to COVID-19. Home infusion involves the intravenous administration of medications at home. For patients to receive home infusions, several components need to be covered: the medication itself, the supplies and equipment, and the services of the home visit nurse. Many conditions require intravenous administration of medication at home, including total parenteral nutrition, intravenous antibiotics, and intravenous immunoglobulins. Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy is one of the most common home infusion services and has been used for 4 decades (4). It has been shown to be a convenient and cost-effective way to complete prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics outside the hospital (5). It and other outpatient intravenous medications can be given in various settings, including at home with the assistance of home health, at outpatient infusion centers, or at skilled-nursing facilities. Most private insurance and Medicare Advantage plans, Tricare, and many state Medicaid programs cover home infusion services, and it is the most commonly used model among these beneficiary groups as a result (6). However, the Medicare fee-for-service program does not adequately cover infusion services provided in patients' homes. Although Medicare Part A covers home nursing, it does so only for patients who are homebound, which many patients in need of home infusion services are not. Medicare Part B covers a few intravenous medications under payment rules about durable medical equipment, but these represent fewer than 10% of antimicrobials prescribed for OPAT (Table) (7). Medicare Part D, used by 70% of Medicare beneficiaries, does cover most of the drugs but not the medically necessary supplies—tubing, bags, needles, and pumps—or the administrative, pharmacy, and nursing services needed to deliver the medication (8).",2020-05-13 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328

DOI:10.7326/L20-0354,10.7326/L20-0354,Letters,Cytokine Levels in the Body Fluids of a Patient With COVID-19 and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Case Report,"Background: Some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiple organ failure (1). Some experts attribute this sequence of events to a large increase in cytokines (cytokine storm) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or a secondary infection by another organism. Objective: To report cytokine levels in multiple body fluids from a patient with COVID-19 and ARDS, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Case Report: On 20 January 2020, a 66-year-old man who had been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 developed cough and fever and treated himself at home. On 2 February, his cough and fever gradually worsened, his body temperature reached 38.7 °C, and he developed diarrhea and vomiting. He was treated at a local hospital, where his medical history included vitiligo, gastric ulcer, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He developed dyspnea 2 days later, and COVID-19 was diagnosed by a throat swab that was tested for nucleic acid. He received the antiviral drug abidol and supportive care. When his dyspnea worsened, he was transferred to the intensive care unit for noninvasive mechanical ventilation. On 11 February, mechanical ventilation was started because of a progressive decrease in blood oxygen saturation, a blood lactate level of 4 mmol/L, and a PaO2–FiO2 ratio of 186 mm Hg. On 17 February, the patient was transferred to the Severe COVID-19 Intensive Treatment Center of Heilongjiang Province. His COVID-19 status was confirmed as a critical type, according to guidelines from the National Health Commission (trial version 7). We treated him with antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin infusions, lung-protective ventilation, and lung recruitment and prone position ventilation. In addition, we started measuring levels of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in his blood daily and in his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pleural fluid intermittently, and we found high levels (Figure). On 23 February, we started continuous renal replacement therapy with an Oxiris filter (Baxter International), which is designed to adsorb uremic toxins, endotoxin, and cytokines. Computed tomography on 24 February showed worsening of pulmonary inflammation. On 1 March, we started extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because we could not                     maintain the patient's oxygenation with intermittent prone position ventilation. On 2 March, the patient developed septic shock and cardiac insufficiency, and we introduced an intra-aortic balloon pump. On 6 March, every-other-day plasmapheresis was started in another attempt to decrease his cytokine levels. Computed tomography on 9 March showed that the patient's lung consolidation had worsened. Unfortunately, the patient died on 14 March. ",2020-05-12 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
DOI:10.7326/M20-1550,10.7326/M20-1550,Letters,Pharmacokinetics of Lopinavir and Ritonavir in Patients Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread around the world, and the lack of effective treatment has fueled a global search for the “magic bullet” against the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 29 April 2020, a total of 997 COVID-19 trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, of which more than 30 are investigating the effects of lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir is the main antiviral agent, whereas ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic “booster” that increases lopinavir plasma concentrations by inhibiting cytochrome 3A4 enzymes (1). The combination is an approved antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV-1 infection. However, in vitro data also suggest antiviral activity of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-1, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 4.1 µg/mL; Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, with an EC50 of 10.8 µg/mL; and, only recently, SARS-CoV-2, with an EC50 of 16.4 µg/mL (2). Importantly, the EC50 for HIV-1 is 0.07 µg/mL, more than 200-fold lower than for SARS-CoV-2 (1). Recently, Cao and colleagues published negative results of a placebo-controlled trial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in which lopinavir treatment did not affect mortality, clinical performance, or viral                     loads (3). Objective: To measure trough levels of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with COVID-19. Methods and Findings: In this series of 8 patients who were admitted to a “normal care” ward because of COVID-19, we quantified trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Patients with concomitant intake of relevant CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors were excluded. Patients were hospitalized and received 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily for 3 to 10 days before analysis, which was done in the morning shortly before the next dose. Assuming a half-life of 4 to 6 hours for lopinavir, steady-state conditions may be assumed for all patients. Analysis of trough levels was chosen because they provide more robust pharmacokinetic information for single time–point assessments and were frequently investigated in HIV trials, which makes the data comparable. Trough concentrations of lopinavir ranged from 6.2 to 24.3 µg/mL (median, 13.6 µg/mL) (Table). Interestingly, in this small sample, trough concentrations seemed to be associated with C-reactive protein (Spearman correlation coefficient rS = 0.81). All patients had an unremarkable disease course and were discharged from the normal care ward. Specific adverse effects of lopinavir and ritonavir were not observed.",2020-05-12 00:00:00,ACP,2020-05-25 20:48:40.311328
